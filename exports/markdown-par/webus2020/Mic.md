## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> <sup>a</sup>word that came to Micah of Morasheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear, you peoples, all of you! <br>Listen, O earth, and all that is therein. <br><sup>b</sup>Yahweh be witness against you, <br>the Lord from his holy temple. <br>
<sup>3</sup> <sup>c</sup>Yahweh comes out of his place, <br>and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The mountains melt under him, <br>and the valleys split apart like wax before the fire, <br>like waters that are poured down a steep place.

<sup>5</sup> “All this is for the disobedience of Jacob, <br>and for the sins of the house of Israel. <br>What is the disobedience of Jacob? <br>Isn’t it Samaria? <br>And what are the high places of Judah? <br>Aren’t they Jerusalem? <br>
<sup>6</sup> Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field, <br>like places for planting vineyards; <br>and I will pour down its stones into the valley, <br>and I will uncover its foundations. <br>
<sup>7</sup> All her idols will be beaten to pieces, <br>all her temple gifts will be burned with fire, <br>and I will destroy all her images; <br>for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them, <br>and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return.”

<sup>8</sup> For this I will lament and wail. <br>I will go stripped and naked. <br>I will howl like the jackals <br>and mourn like the ostriches. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For her wounds are incurable; <br>for it has come even to Judah. <br>It reaches to the gate of my people, <br>even to Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t tell it in Gath. <br>Don’t weep at all. <br><sup>d</sup>I have rolled myself in the dust. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame. <br>The inhabitant of Zaanan won’t come out. <br>The wailing of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection. <br>
<sup>12</sup> For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good, <br>because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish. <br>She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; <br>for the transgressions of Israel were found in you. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath. <br>The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the kings of Israel. <br>
<sup>15</sup> I will yet bring a conqueror to you, inhabitants of Mareshah. <br>The glory of Israel will come to Adullam. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Shave your heads, <br>and cut off your hair for the children of your delight. <br>Enlarge your baldness like the vulture, <br>for they have gone into captivity from you!

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Woe to those who devise iniquity <br>and work evil on their beds! <br>When the morning is light, they practice it, <br>because it is in the power of their hand. <br>
<sup>2</sup> They covet fields and seize them, <br>and houses, then take them away. <br>They oppress a man and his house, <br>even a man and his heritage. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Therefore Yahweh says: <br>“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster, <br>from which you will not remove your necks, <br>neither will you walk haughtily, <br>for it is an evil time. <br>
<sup>4</sup> In that day they will take up a parable against you, <br>and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying, <br>‘We are utterly ruined! <br>My people’s possession is divided up. <br>Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’ ” <br>
<sup>5</sup> Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in Yahweh’s assembly. <br>
<sup>6</sup> “Don’t prophesy!”—they prophesy— <br>“Don’t prophesy about these things. <br>Disgrace won’t overtake us.” <br>
<sup>7</sup> Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, <br>“Is Yahweh’s Spirit angry? <br>Are these his doings? <br>Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?” <br>
<sup>8</sup> But lately my people have risen up as an enemy. <br>You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle. <br>
<sup>9</sup> You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses; <br>from their young children you take away my blessing forever. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Arise, and depart! <br>For this is not your resting place, <br>because of uncleanness that destroys, <br>even with a grievous destruction. <br>
<sup>11</sup> If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies, saying, <br>“I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink,” <br>he would be the prophet of this people. <br>
<sup>12</sup> I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob. <br>I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. <br>I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, <br>as a flock in the middle of their pasture. <br>They will swarm with people. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He who breaks open the way goes up before them. <br>They break through the gate, and go out. <br>Their king passes on before them, <br>with Yahweh at their head.
## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> I said, <br>“Please listen, you heads of Jacob, <br>and rulers of the house of Israel: <br>Isn’t it for you to know justice? <br>
<sup>2</sup> You who hate the good, <br>and love the evil; <br>who tear off their skin, <br>and their flesh from off their bones; <br>
<sup>3</sup> who also eat the flesh of my people, <br>and peel their skin from off them, <br>and break their bones, <br>and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, <br>and as meat within the cauldron. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Then they will cry to Yahweh, <br>but he will not answer them. <br>Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, <br>because they made their deeds evil.”

<sup>5</sup> Yahweh says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray—for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, “Peace!” and whoever doesn’t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him: <br>
<sup>6</sup> “Therefore night is over you, with no vision, <br>and it is dark to you, that you may not divine; <br>and the sun will go down on the prophets, <br>and the day will be black over them. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The seers shall be disappointed, <br>and the diviners confounded. <br>Yes, they shall all cover their lips, <br><sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>8</sup> But as for me, I am full of power by Yahweh’s Spirit, <br>and of judgment, and of might, <br>to declare to Jacob his disobedience, <br>and to Israel his sin. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob, <br>and rulers of the house of Israel, <br>who abhor justice, <br>and pervert all equity, <br>
<sup>10</sup> who build up Zion with blood, <br>and Jerusalem with iniquity. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Her leaders judge for bribes, <br>and her priests teach for a price, <br>and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money; <br>yet they lean on Yahweh, and say, <br>“Isn’t Yahweh among us? <br>No disaster will come on us.” <br>
<sup>12</sup> Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field, <br>and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, <br>and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest.

## Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> But in the latter days, <br>it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains, <br>and it will be exalted above the hills; <br>and peoples will stream to it. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Many nations will go and say, <br>“Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh, <br>and to the house of the God of Jacob; <br>and he will teach us of his ways, <br>and we will walk in his paths.” <br>For the law will go out of Zion, <br>and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem; <br>
<sup>3</sup> and he will judge between many peoples, <br>and will decide concerning strong nations afar off. <br>They will beat their swords into plowshares, <br>and their spears into pruning hooks. <br>Nation will not lift up sword against nation, <br>neither will they learn war any more. <br>
<sup>4</sup> But every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree. <br>No one will make them afraid, <br>for the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.
<sup>5</sup> Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods, <br>but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever. <br>
<sup>6</sup> “In that day,” says Yahweh, <br>“I will assemble that which is lame, <br>and I will gather that which is driven away, <br>and that which I have afflicted; <br>
<sup>7</sup> and I will make that which was lame a remnant, <br>and that which was cast far off a strong nation: <br>and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.” <br>
<sup>8</sup> You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, <br>to you it will come. <br>Yes, the former dominion will come, <br>the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.

<sup>9</sup> Now why do you cry out aloud? <br>Is there no king in you? <br>Has your counselor perished, <br>that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail? <br>
<sup>10</sup> Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion, <br>like a woman in travail; <br>for now you will go out of the city, <br>and will dwell in the field, <br>and will come even to Babylon. <br>There you will be rescued. <br>There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.

<sup>11</sup> Now many nations have assembled against you, that say, <br>“Let her be defiled, <br>and let our eye gloat over Zion.” <br>
<sup>12</sup> But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh, <br>neither do they understand his counsel; <br>for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, <br>for I will make your horn iron, <br>and I will make your hoofs bronze. <br>You will beat in pieces many peoples. <br>I will devote their gain to Yahweh, <br>and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
## Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Now you shall gather yourself in troops, <br>daughter of troops. <br>He has laid siege against us. <br>They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek. <br>
<sup>2</sup> But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, <br>being small among the clans of Judah, <br>out of you one will come out to me who is to be ruler in Israel; <br>whose goings out are from of old, from ancient times. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth. <br>Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh, <br>in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God. <br>They will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land <br>and when he marches through our fortresses, <br>then we will raise against him seven shepherds, <br>and eight leaders of men. <br>
<sup>6</sup> They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, <br>and the land of Nimrod in its gates. <br>He will deliver us from the Assyrian, <br>when he invades our land, <br>and when he marches within our border. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples <br>like dew from Yahweh, <br>like showers on the grass, <br>that don’t wait for man <br>nor wait for the sons of men. <br>
<sup>8</sup> The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, <br>among many peoples, <br>like a lion among the animals of the forest, <br>like a young lion among the flocks of sheep; <br>who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, <br>and there is no one to deliver. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries, <br>and let all of your enemies be cut off. <br>
<sup>10</sup> “It will happen in that day”, says Yahweh, <br>“that I will cut off your horses from among you <br>and will destroy your chariots. <br>
<sup>11</sup> I will cut off the cities of your land <br>and will tear down all your strongholds. <br>
<sup>12</sup> I will destroy witchcraft from your hand. <br>You shall have no soothsayers. <br>
<sup>13</sup> I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars from among you; <br>and you shall no more worship the work of your hands. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I will uproot your Asherah poles from among you; <br>and I will destroy your cities. <br>
<sup>15</sup> I will execute vengeance in anger <br>and wrath on the nations that didn’t listen.”
## Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Listen now to what Yahweh says: <br>“Arise, plead your case before the mountains, <br>and let the hills hear what you have to say. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear, you mountains, Yahweh’s indictment, <br>and you enduring foundations of the earth; <br>for Yahweh has a case against his people, <br>and he will contend with Israel. <br>
<sup>3</sup> My people, what have I done to you? <br>How have I burdened you? <br>Answer me! <br>
<sup>4</sup> For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, <br>and redeemed you out of the house of bondage. <br>I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. <br>
<sup>5</sup> My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, <br>and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, <br>that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.”

<sup>6</sup> How shall I come before Yahweh, <br>and bow myself before the exalted God? <br>Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, <br>with calves a year old? <br>
<sup>7</sup> Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams? <br>With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? <br>Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience? <br>The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? <br>
<sup>8</sup> He has shown you, O man, what is good. <br>What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly, <br>to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?

<sup>9</sup> Yahweh’s voice calls to the city— <br>and wisdom fears your name— <br>“Listen to the rod, <br>and he who appointed it. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, <br><sup>a</sup>that is accursed? <br>
<sup>11</sup> Shall I tolerate dishonest scales, <br>and a bag of deceitful weights? <br>
<sup>12</sup> Her rich men are full of violence, <br>her inhabitants speak lies, <br>and their tongue is deceitful in their speech. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound. <br>I have made you desolate because of your sins. <br>
<sup>14</sup> You shall eat, but not be satisfied. <br>Your hunger will be within you. <br>You will store up, but not save, <br>and that which you save I will give up to the sword. <br>
<sup>15</sup> You will sow, but won’t reap. <br>You will tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil; <br>and crush grapes, but won’t drink the wine. <br>
<sup>16</sup> For the statutes of Omri are kept, <br>and all the works of Ahab’s house. <br>You walk in their counsels, <br>that I may make you a ruin, <br>and your inhabitants a hissing. <br>You will bear the reproach of my people.”

## Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Misery is mine! <br>Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard. <br>There is no cluster of grapes to eat. <br>My soul desires to eat the early fig. <br>
<sup>2</sup> The godly man has perished out of the earth, <br>and there is no one upright among men. <br>They all lie in wait for blood; <br>every man hunts his brother with a net. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently. <br>The ruler and judge ask for a bribe. <br>The powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul. <br>Thus they conspire together. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The best of them is like a brier. <br>The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. <br>The day of your watchmen, <br>even your visitation, has come; <br>now is the time of their confusion. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Don’t trust in a neighbor. <br>Don’t put confidence in a friend. <br>With the woman lying in your embrace, <br>be careful of the words of your mouth! <br>
<sup>6</sup> For the son dishonors the father, <br>the daughter rises up against her mother, <br>the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; <br>a man’s enemies are the men of his own house. <br>
<sup>7</sup> But as for me, I will look to Yahweh. <br>I will wait for the God of my salvation. <br>My God will hear me. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy. <br>When I fall, I will arise. <br>When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me. <br>
<sup>9</sup> I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, <br>because I have sinned against him, <br>until he pleads my case and executes judgment for me. <br>He will bring me out to the light. <br>I will see his righteousness. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Then my enemy will see it, <br>and shame will cover her who said to me, <br>“Where is Yahweh your God?” <br>My eyes will see her. <br>Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets. <br>
<sup>11</sup> A day to build your walls! <br>In that day, he will extend your boundary. <br>
<sup>12</sup> In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, <br>and from Egypt even to the River, <br>and from sea to sea, <br>and mountain to mountain. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein, <br>for the fruit of their doings. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Shepherd your people with your staff, <br>the flock of your heritage, <br>who dwell by themselves in a forest. <br>Let them feed in the middle of fertile pasture land, <br>in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. <br>
<sup>15</sup> “As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt, <br>I will show them marvelous things.” <br>
<sup>16</sup> The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might. <br>They will lay their hand on their mouth. <br>Their ears will be deaf. <br>
<sup>17</sup> They will lick the dust like a serpent. <br>Like crawling things of the earth, they will come trembling out of their dens. <br>They will come with fear to Yahweh our God, <br>and will be afraid because of you. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity, <br>and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage? <br>He doesn’t retain his anger forever, <br>because he delights in loving kindness. <br>
<sup>19</sup> He will again have compassion on us. <br>He will tread our iniquities under foot. <br>You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. <br>
<sup>20</sup> You will give truth to Jacob, <br>and mercy to Abraham, <br>as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
