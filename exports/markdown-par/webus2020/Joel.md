## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> <sup>a</sup>word that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear this, you elders, <br>and listen, all you inhabitants of the land! <br>Has this ever happened in your days, <br>or in the days of your fathers? <br>
<sup>3</sup> Tell your children about it, <br>and have your children tell their children, <br>and their children, another generation. <br>
<sup>4</sup> What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten. <br>What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten. <br>What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! <br>Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, <br>for it is cut off from your mouth. <br>
<sup>6</sup> For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number. <br>His teeth are the teeth of a lion, <br>and he has the fangs of a lioness. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He has laid my vine waste, <br>and stripped my fig tree. <br>He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away. <br>Its branches are made white. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth <br>for the husband of her youth! <br>
<sup>9</sup> The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh’s house. <br>The priests, Yahweh’s ministers, mourn. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The field is laid waste. <br>The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed, <br>The new wine has dried up, <br>and the oil languishes. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Be confounded, you farmers! <br>Wail, you vineyard keepers, <br>for the wheat and for the barley; <br>for the harvest of the field has perished. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered— <br>the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, <br>even all of the trees of the field are withered; <br>for joy has withered away from the sons of men. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests! <br>Wail, you ministers of the altar. <br><sup>b</sup><br>for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your God’s house. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Sanctify a fast. <br>Call a solemn assembly. <br>Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Yahweh, your God, <br>and cry to Yahweh. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Alas for the day! <br>For the day of Yahweh is at hand, <br>and it will come as destruction from the Almighty. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes, <br>joy and gladness from the house of our God? <br>
<sup>17</sup> The seeds rot under their clods. <br>The granaries are laid desolate. <br>The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered. <br>
<sup>18</sup> How the animals groan! <br>The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture. <br>Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Yahweh, I cry to you, <br>for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, <br>and the flame has burned all the trees of the field. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Yes, the animals of the field pant to you, <br>for the water brooks have dried up, <br>and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Blow the trumpet in Zion, <br>and sound an alarm in my holy mountain! <br>Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, <br>for the day of Yahweh comes, <br>for it is close at hand: <br>
<sup>2</sup> A day of darkness and gloominess, <br>a day of clouds and thick darkness. <br>As the dawn spreading on the mountains, <br>a great and strong people; <br>there has never been the like, <br>neither will there be any more after them, <br>even to the years of many generations. <br>
<sup>3</sup> A fire devours before them, <br>and behind them, a flame burns. <br>The land is as the garden of Eden before them, <br>and behind them, a desolate wilderness. <br>Yes, and no one has escaped them. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, <br>and they run as horsemen. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap, <br>like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, <br>like a strong people set in battle array. <br>
<sup>6</sup> At their presence the peoples are in anguish. <br>All faces have grown pale. <br>
<sup>7</sup> They run like mighty men. <br>They climb the wall like warriors. <br>They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course. <br>
<sup>8</sup> One doesn’t jostle another. <br>They each march in their own path. <br>They burst through the defenses <br>and don’t break ranks. <br>
<sup>9</sup> They rush on the city. <br>They run on the wall. <br>They climb up into the houses. <br>They enter in at the windows like thieves. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The earth quakes before them. <br>The heavens tremble. <br>The sun and the moon are darkened, <br>and the stars withdraw their shining. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Yahweh thunders his voice before his army, <br>for his forces are very great; <br>for he is strong who obeys his command; <br>for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome, <br>and who can endure it? <br>
<sup>12</sup> “Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart, <br>and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.” <br>
<sup>13</sup> Tear your heart and not your garments, <br>and turn to Yahweh, your God; <br>for he is gracious and merciful, <br>slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, <br>and relents from sending calamity. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Who knows? He may turn and relent, <br>and leave a blessing behind him, <br>even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Blow the trumpet in Zion! <br>Sanctify a fast. <br>Call a solemn assembly. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Gather the people. <br>Sanctify the assembly. <br>Assemble the elders. <br>Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts. <br>Let the bridegroom go out of his room, <br>and the bride out of her chamber. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar, <br>and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh, <br>and don’t give your heritage to reproach, <br>that the nations should rule over them. <br>Why should they say among the peoples, <br>‘Where is their God?’ ” <br>
<sup>18</sup> Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, <br>and had pity on his people. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Yahweh answered his people, <br><sup>a</sup>I will send you grain, new wine, and oil, <br>and you will be satisfied with them; <br>and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. <br>
<sup>20</sup> But I will remove the northern army far away from you, <br>and will drive it into a barren and desolate land, <br>its front into the eastern sea, <br>and its back into the western sea; <br>and its stench will come up, <br>and its bad smell will rise.” <br>Surely he has done great things. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Land, don’t be afraid. <br>Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field; <br>for the pastures of the wilderness spring up, <br>for the tree bears its fruit. <br>The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.

<sup>23</sup> “Be glad then, you children of Zion, <br>and rejoice in Yahweh, your God; <br>for he gives you the early rain in just measure, <br>and he causes the rain to come down for you, <br>the early rain and the latter rain, as before. <br>
<sup>24</sup> The threshing floors will be full of wheat, <br>and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. <br>
<sup>25</sup> I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, <br>the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar, <br>my great army, which I sent among you. <br>
<sup>26</sup> You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied, <br>and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God, <br>who has dealt wondrously with you; <br>and my people will never again be disappointed. <br>
<sup>27</sup> You will know that I am among Israel, <br>and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else; <br>and my people will never again be disappointed.

<sup>28</sup> “It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; <br>and your sons and your daughters will prophesy. <br>Your old men will dream dreams. <br>Your young men will see visions. <br>
<sup>29</sup> And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days, <br>I will pour out my Spirit. <br>
<sup>30</sup> I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: <br>blood, fire, and pillars of smoke. <br>
<sup>31</sup> The sun will be turned into darkness, <br>and the moon into blood, <br>before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes. <br>
<sup>32</sup> It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved; <br>for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, <br>as Yahweh has said, <br>and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.

> - <sup>a</sup> 19. “Behold”, from “[hebrew]הִנֵּה[/hebrew]”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.

## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> “For, behold, in those days, <br>and in that time, <br>when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, <br>
<sup>2</sup> I will gather all nations, <br>and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; <br>and I will execute judgment on them there for my people, <br>and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations. <br>They have divided my land, <br>
<sup>3</sup> and have cast lots for my people, <br>and have given a boy for a prostitute, <br>and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.

<sup>4</sup> “Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre and Sidon, <br>and all the regions of Philistia? <br>Will you repay me? <br>And if you repay me, <br>I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Because you have taken my silver and my gold, <br>and have carried my finest treasures into your temples, <br>
<sup>6</sup> and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, <br>that you may remove them far from their border. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them, <br>and will return your repayment on your own head; <br>
<sup>8</sup> and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah, <br>and they will sell them to the men of Sheba, <br>to a faraway nation, <br>for Yahweh has spoken it.”

<sup>9</sup> Proclaim this among the nations: <br>“Prepare for war! <br>Stir up the mighty men. <br>Let all the warriors draw near. <br>Let them come up.
<sup>10</sup> Beat your plowshares into swords, <br>and your pruning hooks into spears. <br>Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’ <br>
<sup>11</sup> Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, <br>and gather yourselves together.” <br>Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>12</sup> “Let the nations arouse themselves, <br>and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; <br>for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Put in the sickle; <br>for the harvest is ripe. <br>Come, tread, for the wine press is full, <br>the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.” <br>
<sup>14</sup> Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! <br>For the day of Yahweh is near in the valley of decision. <br>
<sup>15</sup> The sun and the moon are darkened, <br>and the stars withdraw their shining. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Yahweh will roar from Zion, <br>and thunder from Jerusalem; <br>and the heavens and the earth will shake; <br>but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people, <br>and a stronghold to the children of Israel. <br>
<sup>17</sup> “So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God, <br>dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. <br>Then Jerusalem will be holy, <br>and no strangers will pass through her any more. <br>
<sup>18</sup> It will happen in that day, <br>that the mountains will drop down sweet wine, <br>the hills will flow with milk, <br>all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters; <br>and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh’s house, <br>and will water the valley of Shittim. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Egypt will be a desolation <br>and Edom will be a desolate wilderness, <br>for the violence done to the children of Judah, <br>because they have shed innocent blood in their land. <br>
<sup>20</sup> But Judah will be inhabited forever, <br>and Jerusalem from generation to generation. <br>
<sup>21</sup> I will cleanse their blood <br>that I have not cleansed, <br>for Yahweh dwells in Zion.”
