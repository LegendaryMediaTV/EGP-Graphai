## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> How the city sits solitary, <br>that was full of people! <br>She has become as a widow, <br>who was great among the nations! <br>She who was a princess among the provinces <br>has become a slave!

<sup>2</sup> She weeps bitterly in the night. <br>Her tears are on her cheeks. <br>Among all her lovers <br>she has no one to comfort her. <br>All her friends have dealt treacherously with her. <br>They have become her enemies.

<sup>3</sup> Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction <br>and because of great servitude. <br>She dwells among the nations. <br>She finds no rest. <br>All her persecutors overtook her in her distress.

<sup>4</sup> The roads to Zion mourn, <br>because no one comes to the solemn assembly. <br>All her gates are desolate. <br>Her priests sigh. <br>Her virgins are afflicted, <br>and she herself is in bitterness.

<sup>5</sup> Her adversaries have become the head. <br>Her enemies prosper; <br><sup>a</sup>has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions. <br>Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary.

<sup>6</sup> All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion. <br>Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture. <br>They have gone without strength before the pursuer.

<sup>7</sup> Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries <br>all her pleasant things that were from the days of old; <br>when her people fell into the hand of the adversary, <br>and no one helped her. <br>The adversaries saw her. <br>They mocked at her desolations.

<sup>8</sup> Jerusalem has grievously sinned. <br>Therefore she has become unclean. <br>All who honored her despise her, <br>because they have seen her nakedness. <br>Yes, she sighs and turns backward.

<sup>9</sup> Her filthiness was in her skirts. <br>She didn’t remember her latter end. <br>Therefore she has come down astoundingly. <br>She has no comforter. <br>“See, Yahweh, my affliction; <br>for the enemy has magnified himself.”

<sup>10</sup> The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things; <br>for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary, <br>concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly.

<sup>11</sup> All her people sigh. <br>They seek bread. <br>They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh their soul. <br>“Look, Yahweh, and see, <br>for I have become despised.”

<sup>12</sup> “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? <br>Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, <br>which is brought on me, <br>with which Yahweh has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.

<sup>13</sup> “From on high has he sent fire into my bones, <br>and it prevails against them. <br>He has spread a net for my feet. <br>He has turned me back. <br>He has made me desolate and I faint all day long.

<sup>14</sup> “The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand. <br>They are knit together. <br>They have come up on my neck. <br>He made my strength fail. <br><sup>b</sup>has delivered me into their hands, <br>against whom I am not able to stand.

<sup>15</sup> “The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men within me. <br>He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men. <br>The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a wine press.

<sup>16</sup> “For these things I weep. <br>My eye, my eye runs down with water, <br>because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me. <br>My children are desolate, <br>because the enemy has prevailed.”

<sup>17</sup> Zion spreads out her hands. <br>There is no one to comfort her. <br>Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob, <br>that those who are around him should be his adversaries. <br>Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.

<sup>18</sup> “Yahweh is righteous, <br>for I have rebelled against his commandment. <br>Please hear all you peoples, <br>and see my sorrow. <br>My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.

<sup>19</sup> “I called for my lovers, <br>but they deceived me. <br>My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city, <br>while they sought food for themselves to refresh their souls.

<sup>20</sup> “Look, Yahweh; for I am in distress. <br>My heart is troubled. <br>My heart turns over within me, <br>for I have grievously rebelled. <br>Abroad, the sword bereaves. <br>At home, it is like death.

<sup>21</sup> “They have heard that I sigh. <br>There is no one to comfort me. <br>All my enemies have heard of my trouble. <br>They are glad that you have done it. <br>You will bring the day that you have proclaimed, <br>and they will be like me.

<sup>22</sup> “Let all their wickedness come before you. <br>Do to them as you have done to me for all my transgressions. <br>For my sighs are many, <br>and my heart is faint.

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! <br>He has cast the beauty of Israel down from heaven to the earth, <br>and hasn’t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.

<sup>2</sup> The Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob <br>without pity. <br>He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. <br>He has brought them down to the ground. <br>He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.

<sup>3</sup> He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger. <br>He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy. <br>He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, <br>which devours all around.

<sup>4</sup> He has bent his bow like an enemy. <br>He has stood with his right hand as an adversary. <br>He has killed all that were pleasant to the eye. <br>In the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his wrath like fire.

<sup>5</sup> The Lord has become as an enemy. <br>He has swallowed up Israel. <br>He has swallowed up all her palaces. <br>He has destroyed his strongholds. <br>He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.

<sup>6</sup> He has violently taken away his tabernacle, <br>as if it were a garden. <br>He has destroyed his place of assembly. <br>Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion. <br>In the indignation of his anger, he has despised the king and the priest.

<sup>7</sup> The Lord has cast off his altar. <br>He has abhorred his sanctuary. <br>He has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy. <br>They have made a noise in Yahweh’s house, <br>as in the day of a solemn assembly.

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. <br>He has stretched out the line. <br>He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying; <br>He has made the rampart and wall lament. <br>They languish together.

<sup>9</sup> Her gates have sunk into the ground. <br>He has destroyed and broken her bars. <br>Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not. <br>Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.

<sup>10</sup> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground. <br>They keep silence. <br>They have cast up dust on their heads. <br>They have clothed themselves with sackcloth. <br>The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.

<sup>11</sup> My eyes fail with tears. <br>My heart is troubled. <br>My bile is poured on the earth, <br>because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, <br>because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.

<sup>12</sup> They ask their mothers, <br>“Where is grain and wine?” <br>when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city, <br>when their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.

<sup>13</sup> What shall I testify to you? <br>What shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem? <br>What shall I compare to you, <br>that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion? <br>For your breach is as big as the sea. <br>Who can heal you?

<sup>14</sup> Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you. <br>They have not uncovered your iniquity, <br>to reverse your captivity, <br>but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment.

<sup>15</sup> All that pass by clap their hands at you. <br>They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, <br>“Is this the city that men called ‘The perfection of beauty, <br>the joy of the whole earth’?”

<sup>16</sup> All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you. <br>They hiss and gnash their teeth. <br>They say, “We have swallowed her up. <br>Certainly this is the day that we looked for. <br>We have found it. <br>We have seen it.”

<sup>17</sup> Yahweh has done that which he planned. <br>He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old. <br>He has thrown down, <br>and has not pitied. <br>He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you. <br>He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.

<sup>18</sup> Their heart cried to the Lord. <br>O wall of the daughter of Zion, <br>let tears run down like a river day and night. <br>Give yourself no relief. <br>Don’t let your eyes rest.

<sup>19</sup> Arise, cry out in the night, <br>at the beginning of the watches! <br>Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. <br>Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, <br>who faint for hunger at the head of every street.

<sup>20</sup> “Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus! <br>Should the women eat their offspring, <br>the children that they held and bounced on their knees? <br>Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?

<sup>21</sup> “The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets. <br>My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. <br>You have killed them in the day of your anger. <br>You have slaughtered, and not pitied.

<sup>22</sup> “You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side. <br>There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh’s anger. <br>My enemy has consumed those whom I have cared for and brought up.
## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> I am the man who has seen affliction <br>by the rod of his wrath. <br>
<sup>2</sup> He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, <br>and not in light. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Surely he turns his hand against me <br>again and again all day long.

<sup>4</sup> He has made my flesh and my skin old. <br>He has broken my bones. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He has built against me, <br>and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He has made me dwell in dark places, <br>as those who have been long dead.

<sup>7</sup> He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out. <br>He has made my chain heavy. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yes, when I cry, and call for help, <br>he shuts out my prayer. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He has walled up my ways with cut stone. <br>He has made my paths crooked.

<sup>10</sup> He is to me as a bear lying in wait, <br>as a lion in hiding. <br>
<sup>11</sup> He has turned away my path, <br>and pulled me in pieces. <br>He has made me desolate. <br>
<sup>12</sup> He has bent his bow, <br>and set me as a mark for the arrow.

<sup>13</sup> He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I have become a derision to all my people, <br>and their song all day long. <br>
<sup>15</sup> He has filled me with bitterness. <br>He has stuffed me with wormwood.

<sup>16</sup> He has also broken my teeth with gravel. <br>He has covered me with ashes. <br>
<sup>17</sup> You have removed my soul far away from peace. <br>I forgot prosperity. <br>
<sup>18</sup> I said, “My strength has perished, <br>along with my expectation from Yahweh.”

<sup>19</sup> Remember my affliction and my misery, <br>the wormwood and the bitterness. <br>
<sup>20</sup> My soul still remembers them, <br>and is bowed down within me. <br>
<sup>21</sup> This I recall to my mind; <br>therefore I have hope.

<sup>22</sup> It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, <br>because his mercies don’t fail. <br>
<sup>23</sup> They are new every morning. <br>Great is your faithfulness. <br>
<sup>24</sup> “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul. <br>“Therefore I will hope in him.”

<sup>25</sup> Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, <br>to the soul who seeks him. <br>
<sup>26</sup> It is good that a man should hope <br>and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh. <br>
<sup>27</sup> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

<sup>28</sup> Let him sit alone and keep silence, <br>because he has laid it on him. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Let him put his mouth in the dust, <br>if it is so that there may be hope. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him. <br>Let him be filled full of reproach.

<sup>31</sup> For the Lord will not cast off forever. <br>
<sup>32</sup> For though he causes grief, <br>yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. <br>
<sup>33</sup> For he does not afflict willingly, <br>nor grieve the children of men.

<sup>34</sup> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth, <br>
<sup>35</sup> to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High, <br>
<sup>36</sup> to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve.

<sup>37</sup> Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, <br>when the Lord doesn’t command it? <br>
<sup>38</sup> Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High? <br>
<sup>39</sup> Why should a living man complain, <br>a man for the punishment of his sins?

<sup>40</sup> Let us search and try our ways, <br>and turn again to Yahweh. <br>
<sup>41</sup> <sup>a</sup>in the heavens. <br>
<sup>42</sup> “We have transgressed and have rebelled. <br>You have not pardoned.

<sup>43</sup> “You have covered us with anger and pursued us. <br>You have killed. <br>You have not pitied. <br>
<sup>44</sup> You have covered yourself with a cloud, <br>so that no prayer can pass through. <br>
<sup>45</sup> You have made us an off-scouring and refuse <br>in the middle of the peoples.

<sup>46</sup> “All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us. <br>
<sup>47</sup> Terror and the pit have come on us, <br>devastation and destruction.”

<sup>48</sup> My eye runs down with streams of water, <br>for the destruction of the daughter of my people. <br>
<sup>49</sup> My eye pours down <br>and doesn’t cease, <br>without any intermission, <br>
<sup>50</sup> until Yahweh looks down, <br>and sees from heaven. <br>
<sup>51</sup> My eye affects my soul, <br>because of all the daughters of my city.

<sup>52</sup> They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, <br>those who are my enemies without cause. <br>
<sup>53</sup> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, <br>and have cast a stone on me. <br>
<sup>54</sup> Waters flowed over my head. <br>I said, “I am cut off.”

<sup>55</sup> I called on your name, Yahweh, <br>out of the lowest dungeon. <br>
<sup>56</sup> You heard my voice: <br>“Don’t hide your ear from my sighing, <br>and my cry.”

<sup>57</sup> You came near in the day that I called on you. <br>You said, “Don’t be afraid.”

<sup>58</sup> Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul. <br>You have redeemed my life. <br>
<sup>59</sup> Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. <br>Judge my cause. <br>
<sup>60</sup> You have seen all their vengeance <br>and all their plans against me.

<sup>61</sup> You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, <br>and all their plans against me, <br>
<sup>62</sup> the lips of those that rose up against me, <br>and their plots against me all day long. <br>
<sup>63</sup> You see their sitting down and their rising up. <br>I am their song.

<sup>64</sup> You will pay them back, Yahweh, <br>according to the work of their hands. <br>
<sup>65</sup> You will give them hardness of heart, <br>your curse to them. <br>
<sup>66</sup> You will pursue them in anger, <br>and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.

## Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> How the gold has become dim! <br>The most pure gold has changed! <br>The stones of the sanctuary are poured out <br>at the head of every street.

<sup>2</sup> The precious sons of Zion, <br>comparable to fine gold, <br>how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers, <br>the work of the hands of the potter!

<sup>3</sup> Even the jackals offer their breast. <br>They nurse their young ones. <br>But the daughter of my people has become cruel, <br>like the ostriches in the wilderness.

<sup>4</sup> The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst. <br>The young children ask for bread, <br>and no one breaks it for them.

<sup>5</sup> Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets. <br>Those who were brought up in purple embrace dunghills.

<sup>6</sup> For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, <br>which was overthrown as in a moment. <br>No hands were laid on her.

<sup>7</sup> Her nobles were purer than snow. <br>They were whiter than milk. <br>They were more ruddy in body than rubies. <br>Their polishing was like sapphire.

<sup>8</sup> Their appearance is blacker than a coal. <br>They are not known in the streets. <br>Their skin clings to their bones. <br>It is withered. <br>It has become like wood.

<sup>9</sup> Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger; <br>for these pine away, stricken through, <br>for lack of the fruits of the field.

<sup>10</sup> The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children. <br>They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.

<sup>11</sup> Yahweh has accomplished his wrath. <br>He has poured out his fierce anger. <br>He has kindled a fire in Zion, <br>which has devoured its foundations.

<sup>12</sup> The kings of the earth didn’t believe, <br>neither did all the inhabitants of the world, <br>that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.

<sup>13</sup> It is because of the sins of her prophets <br>and the iniquities of her priests, <br>that have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her.

<sup>14</sup> They wander as blind men in the streets. <br>They are polluted with blood, <br>So that men can’t touch their garments.

<sup>15</sup> “Go away!” they cried to them. <br>“Unclean! Go away! Go away! Don’t touch! <br>When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, <br>“They can’t live here any more.”

<sup>16</sup> Yahweh’s anger has scattered them. <br>He will not pay attention to them any more. <br>They didn’t respect the persons of the priests. <br>They didn’t favor the elders.

<sup>17</sup> Our eyes still fail, <br>looking in vain for our help. <br>In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.

<sup>18</sup> They hunt our steps, <br>so that we can’t go in our streets. <br>Our end is near. <br>Our days are fulfilled, <br>for our end has come.

<sup>19</sup> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky. <br>They chased us on the mountains. <br>They set an ambush for us in the wilderness.

<sup>20</sup> The breath of our nostrils, <br>the anointed of Yahweh, <br>was taken in their pits; <br>of whom we said, <br>under his shadow we will live among the nations.

<sup>21</sup> Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom, <br>who dwells in the land of Uz. <br>The cup will pass through to you also. <br>You will be drunken, <br>and will make yourself naked.

<sup>22</sup> The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion. <br>He will no more carry you away into captivity. <br>He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom. <br>He will uncover your sins.
## Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Remember, Yahweh, what has come on us. <br>Look, and see our reproach. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, <br>our houses to aliens. <br>
<sup>3</sup> We are orphans and fatherless. <br>Our mothers are as widows. <br>
<sup>4</sup> We must pay for water to drink. <br>Our wood is sold to us. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Our pursuers are on our necks. <br>We are weary, and have no rest. <br>
<sup>6</sup> We have given our hands to the Egyptians, <br>and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Our fathers sinned, and are no more. <br>We have borne their iniquities. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Servants rule over us. <br>There is no one to deliver us out of their hand. <br>
<sup>9</sup> We get our bread at the peril of our lives, <br>because of the sword in the wilderness. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Our skin is black like an oven, <br>because of the burning heat of famine. <br>
<sup>11</sup> They ravished the women in Zion, <br>the virgins in the cities of Judah. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Princes were hanged up by their hands. <br>The faces of elders were not honored. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The young men carry millstones. <br>The children stumbled under loads of wood. <br>
<sup>14</sup> The elders have ceased from the gate, <br>and the young men from their music. <br>
<sup>15</sup> The joy of our heart has ceased. <br>Our dance is turned into mourning. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The crown has fallen from our head. <br>Woe to us, for we have sinned! <br>
<sup>17</sup> For this our heart is faint. <br>For these things our eyes are dim: <br>
<sup>18</sup> for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate. <br>The foxes walk on it.

<sup>19</sup> You, Yahweh, remain forever. <br>Your throne is from generation to generation. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Why do you forget us forever, <br>and forsake us for so long a time? <br>
<sup>21</sup> Turn us to yourself, Yahweh, and we will be turned. <br>Renew our days as of old. <br>
<sup>22</sup> But you have utterly rejected us. <br>You are very angry against us.
