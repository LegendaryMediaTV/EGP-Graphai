## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel: <br>
<sup>2</sup> to know wisdom and instruction; <br>to discern the words of understanding; <br>
<sup>3</sup> to receive instruction in wise dealing, <br>in righteousness, justice, and equity; <br>
<sup>4</sup> to give prudence to the simple, <br>knowledge and discretion to the young man— <br>
<sup>5</sup> that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; <br>that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel; <br>
<sup>6</sup> to understand a proverb and parables, <br>the words and riddles of the wise.

<sup>7</sup> <sup>a</sup>is the beginning of knowledge, <br>but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. <br>
<sup>8</sup> My son, listen to your father’s instruction, <br>and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching; <br>
<sup>9</sup> for they will be a garland to grace your head, <br>and chains around your neck. <br>
<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you, <br>don’t consent. <br>
<sup>11</sup> If they say, “Come with us. <br>Let’s lie in wait for blood. <br>Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause. <br>
<sup>12</sup> <sup>b</sup><br>and whole, like those who go down into the pit. <br>
<sup>13</sup> We’ll find all valuable wealth. <br>We’ll fill our houses with plunder. <br>
<sup>14</sup> You shall cast your lot among us. <br>We’ll all have one purse”— <br>
<sup>15</sup> my son, don’t walk on the path with them. <br>Keep your foot from their path, <br>
<sup>16</sup> for their feet run to evil. <br>They hurry to shed blood. <br>
<sup>17</sup> For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird; <br>
<sup>18</sup> but these lay in wait for their own blood. <br>They lurk secretly for their own lives. <br>
<sup>19</sup> So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. <br>It takes away the life of its owners.

<sup>20</sup> Wisdom calls aloud in the street. <br>She utters her voice in the public squares. <br>
<sup>21</sup> She calls at the head of noisy places. <br>At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words: <br>
<sup>22</sup> “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? <br>How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, <br>and fools hate knowledge? <br>
<sup>23</sup> Turn at my reproof. <br><sup>c</sup>I will pour out my spirit on you. <br>I will make known my words to you. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Because I have called, and you have refused; <br>I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention; <br>
<sup>25</sup> but you have ignored all my counsel, <br>and wanted none of my reproof; <br>
<sup>26</sup> I also will laugh at your disaster. <br>I will mock when calamity overtakes you, <br>
<sup>27</sup> when calamity overtakes you like a storm, <br>when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind, <br>when distress and anguish come on you. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. <br>They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me, <br>
<sup>29</sup> because they hated knowledge, <br>and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh. <br>
<sup>30</sup> They wanted none of my counsel. <br>They despised all my reproof. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, <br>and be filled with their own schemes. <br>
<sup>32</sup> For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. <br>The careless ease of fools will destroy them. <br>
<sup>33</sup> But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, <br>and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”

> - <sup>c</sup> 23. “Behold”, from “[hebrew]הִנֵּה[/hebrew]”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> My son, if you will receive my words, <br>and store up my commandments within you, <br>
<sup>2</sup> so as to turn your ear to wisdom, <br>and apply your heart to understanding; <br>
<sup>3</sup> yes, if you call out for discernment, <br>and lift up your voice for understanding; <br>
<sup>4</sup> if you seek her as silver, <br>and search for her as for hidden treasures; <br>
<sup>5</sup> then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, <br><sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>6</sup> For Yahweh gives wisdom. <br>Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. <br>He is a shield to those who walk in integrity, <br>
<sup>8</sup> that he may guard the paths of justice, <br>and preserve the way of his saints. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Then you will understand righteousness and justice, <br>equity and every good path. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For wisdom will enter into your heart. <br>Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Discretion will watch over you. <br>Understanding will keep you, <br>
<sup>12</sup> to deliver you from the way of evil, <br>from the men who speak perverse things, <br>
<sup>13</sup> who forsake the paths of uprightness, <br>to walk in the ways of darkness, <br>
<sup>14</sup> who rejoice to do evil, <br>and delight in the perverseness of evil, <br>
<sup>15</sup> who are crooked in their ways, <br>and wayward in their paths, <br>
<sup>16</sup> to deliver you from the strange woman, <br>even from the foreigner who flatters with her words, <br>
<sup>17</sup> who forsakes the friend of her youth, <br>and forgets the covenant of her God; <br>
<sup>18</sup> for her house leads down to death, <br>her paths to the departed spirits. <br>
<sup>19</sup> None who go to her return again, <br>neither do they attain to the paths of life. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Therefore walk in the way of good men, <br>and keep the paths of the righteous. <br>
<sup>21</sup> For the upright will dwell in the land. <br>The perfect will remain in it. <br>
<sup>22</sup> But the wicked will be cut off from the land. <br>The treacherous will be rooted out of it.

> - <sup>a</sup> 5. The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “[hebrew]אֱלֹהִ֑ים[/hebrew]” (Elohim).

## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> My son, don’t forget my teaching, <br>but let your heart keep my commandments, <br>
<sup>2</sup> for they will add to you length of days, <br>years of life, and peace. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you. <br>Bind them around your neck. <br>Write them on the tablet of your heart. <br>
<sup>4</sup> So you will find favor, <br>and good understanding in the sight of God and man. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, <br>and don’t lean on your own understanding. <br>
<sup>6</sup> In all your ways acknowledge him, <br>and he will make your paths straight. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t be wise in your own eyes. <br>Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil. <br>
<sup>8</sup> It will be health to your body, <br>and nourishment to your bones. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Honor Yahweh with your substance, <br>with the first fruits of all your increase; <br>
<sup>10</sup> so your barns will be filled with plenty, <br>and your vats will overflow with new wine. <br>
<sup>11</sup> My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline, <br>neither be weary of his correction; <br>
<sup>12</sup> for whom Yahweh loves, he corrects, <br>even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.

<sup>13</sup> Happy is the man who finds wisdom, <br>the man who gets understanding. <br>
<sup>14</sup> For her good profit is better than getting silver, <br>and her return is better than fine gold. <br>
<sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies. <br>None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand. <br>In her left hand are riches and honor. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness. <br>All her paths are peace. <br>
<sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. <br>Happy is everyone who retains her. <br>
<sup>19</sup> By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. <br>By understanding, he established the heavens. <br>
<sup>20</sup> By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, <br>and the skies drop down the dew. <br>
<sup>21</sup> My son, let them not depart from your eyes. <br>Keep sound wisdom and discretion, <br>
<sup>22</sup> so they will be life to your soul, <br>and grace for your neck. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Then you shall walk in your way securely. <br>Your foot won’t stumble. <br>
<sup>24</sup> When you lie down, you will not be afraid. <br>Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t be afraid of sudden fear, <br>neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes; <br>
<sup>26</sup> for Yahweh will be your confidence, <br>and will keep your foot from being taken.

<sup>27</sup> Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due, <br>when it is in the power of your hand to do it. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again; <br>tomorrow I will give it to you,” <br>when you have it by you. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t devise evil against your neighbor, <br>since he dwells securely by you. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Don’t strive with a man without cause, <br>if he has done you no harm. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Don’t envy the man of violence. <br>Choose none of his ways. <br>
<sup>32</sup> For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, <br>but his friendship is with the upright. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked, <br>but he blesses the habitation of the righteous. <br>
<sup>34</sup> Surely he mocks the mockers, <br>but he gives grace to the humble. <br>
<sup>35</sup> The wise will inherit glory, <br>but shame will be the promotion of fools.
## Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction. <br>Pay attention and know understanding; <br>
<sup>2</sup> for I give you sound learning. <br>Don’t forsake my law. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For I was a son to my father, <br>tender and an only child in the sight of my mother. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He taught me, and said to me: <br>“Let your heart retain my words. <br>Keep my commandments, and live. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Get wisdom. <br>Get understanding. <br>Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you. <br>Love her, and she will keep you. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is supreme. <br>Get wisdom. <br>Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Esteem her, and she will exalt you. <br>She will bring you to honor when you embrace her. <br>
<sup>9</sup> She will give to your head a garland of grace. <br>She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”

<sup>10</sup> Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. <br>The years of your life will be many. <br>
<sup>11</sup> I have taught you in the way of wisdom. <br>I have led you in straight paths. <br>
<sup>12</sup> When you go, your steps will not be hampered. <br>When you run, you will not stumble. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Take firm hold of instruction. <br>Don’t let her go. <br>Keep her, for she is your life. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Don’t enter into the path of the wicked. <br>Don’t walk in the way of evil men. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Avoid it, and don’t pass by it. <br>Turn from it, and pass on. <br>
<sup>16</sup> For they don’t sleep unless they do evil. <br>Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall. <br>
<sup>17</sup> For they eat the bread of wickedness <br>and drink the wine of violence. <br>
<sup>18</sup> But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light <br>that shines more and more until the perfect day. <br>
<sup>19</sup> The way of the wicked is like darkness. <br>They don’t know what they stumble over.

<sup>20</sup> My son, attend to my words. <br>Turn your ear to my sayings. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Let them not depart from your eyes. <br>Keep them in the center of your heart. <br>
<sup>22</sup> For they are life to those who find them, <br>and health to their whole body. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Keep your heart with all diligence, <br>for out of it is the wellspring of life. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. <br>Put corrupt lips far from you. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Let your eyes look straight ahead. <br>Fix your gaze directly before you. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Make the path of your feet level. <br>Let all of your ways be established. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left. <br>Remove your foot from evil.
## Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> My son, pay attention to my wisdom. <br>Turn your ear to my understanding, <br>
<sup>2</sup> that you may maintain discretion, <br>that your lips may preserve knowledge. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. <br>Her mouth is smoother than oil, <br>
<sup>4</sup> but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, <br>and as sharp as a two-edged sword. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death. <br><sup>a</sup><br>
<sup>6</sup> She gives no thought to the way of life. <br>Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.

<sup>7</sup> Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. <br>Don’t depart from the words of my mouth. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Remove your way far from her. <br>Don’t come near the door of her house, <br>
<sup>9</sup> lest you give your honor to others, <br>and your years to the cruel one; <br>
<sup>10</sup> lest strangers feast on your wealth, <br>and your labors enrich another man’s house. <br>
<sup>11</sup> You will groan at your latter end, <br>when your flesh and your body are consumed, <br>
<sup>12</sup> and say, “How I have hated instruction, <br>and my heart despised reproof. <br>
<sup>13</sup> I haven’t obeyed the voice of my teachers, <br>nor turned my ear to those who instructed me! <br>
<sup>14</sup> I have come to the brink of utter ruin, <br>among the gathered assembly.”

<sup>15</sup> Drink water out of your own cistern, <br>running water out of your own well. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Should your springs overflow in the streets, <br>streams of water in the public squares? <br>
<sup>17</sup> Let them be for yourself alone, <br>not for strangers with you. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Let your spring be blessed. <br>Rejoice in the wife of your youth. <br>
<sup>19</sup> A loving doe and a graceful deer— <br>let her breasts satisfy you at all times. <br>Be captivated always with her love. <br>
<sup>20</sup> For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? <br>Why embrace the bosom of another? <br>
<sup>21</sup> For the ways of man are before Yahweh’s eyes. <br>He examines all his paths. <br>
<sup>22</sup> The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. <br>The cords of his sin hold him firmly. <br>
<sup>23</sup> He will die for lack of instruction. <br>In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.

> - <sup>a</sup> 5. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, <br>if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger, <br>
<sup>2</sup> you are trapped by the words of your mouth; <br>you are ensnared with the words of your mouth. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, <br>since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. <br>Go, humble yourself. <br>Press your plea with your neighbor. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Give no sleep to your eyes, <br>nor slumber to your eyelids. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, <br>like a bird from the snare of the fowler.

<sup>6</sup> Go to the ant, you sluggard. <br>Consider her ways, and be wise; <br>
<sup>7</sup> which having no chief, overseer, or ruler, <br>
<sup>8</sup> provides her bread in the summer, <br>and gathers her food in the harvest. <br>
<sup>9</sup> How long will you sleep, sluggard? <br>When will you arise out of your sleep? <br>
<sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, <br>a little folding of the hands to sleep— <br>
<sup>11</sup> so your poverty will come as a robber, <br>and your scarcity as an armed man.

<sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a man of iniquity, <br>is he who walks with a perverse mouth, <br>
<sup>13</sup> who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, <br>who motions with his fingers, <br>
<sup>14</sup> in whose heart is perverseness, <br>who devises evil continually, <br>who always sows discord. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. <br>He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.

<sup>16</sup> There are six things which Yahweh hates; <br>yes, seven which are an abomination to him: <br>
<sup>17</sup> arrogant eyes, a lying tongue, <br>hands that shed innocent blood, <br>
<sup>18</sup> a heart that devises wicked schemes, <br>feet that are swift in running to mischief, <br>
<sup>19</sup> a false witness who utters lies, <br>and he who sows discord among brothers.

<sup>20</sup> My son, keep your father’s commandment, <br>and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Bind them continually on your heart. <br>Tie them around your neck. <br>
<sup>22</sup> When you walk, it will lead you. <br>When you sleep, it will watch over you. <br>When you awake, it will talk with you. <br>
<sup>23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp, <br>and the law is light. <br>Reproofs of instruction are the way of life, <br>
<sup>24</sup> to keep you from the immoral woman, <br>from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart, <br>neither let her captivate you with her eyelids. <br>
<sup>26</sup> For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. <br>The adulteress hunts for your precious life. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Can a man scoop fire into his lap, <br>and his clothes not be burned? <br>
<sup>28</sup> Or can one walk on hot coals, <br>and his feet not be scorched? <br>
<sup>29</sup> So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife. <br>Whoever touches her will not be unpunished. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Men don’t despise a thief <br>if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry, <br>
<sup>31</sup> but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. <br>He shall give all the wealth of his house. <br>
<sup>32</sup> He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. <br>He who does it destroys his own soul. <br>
<sup>33</sup> He will get wounds and dishonor. <br>His reproach will not be wiped away. <br>
<sup>34</sup> For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. <br>He won’t spare in the day of vengeance. <br>
<sup>35</sup> He won’t regard any ransom, <br>neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.
## Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words. <br>Lay up my commandments within you. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments and live! <br>Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Bind them on your fingers. <br>Write them on the tablet of your heart. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.” <br>Call understanding your relative, <br>
<sup>5</sup> that they may keep you from the strange woman, <br>from the foreigner who flatters with her words. <br>
<sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house, <br>I looked out through my lattice. <br>
<sup>7</sup> I saw among the simple ones. <br>I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding, <br>
<sup>8</sup> passing through the street near her corner, <br>he went the way to her house, <br>
<sup>9</sup> in the twilight, in the evening of the day, <br>in the middle of the night and in the darkness. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, <br>and with crafty intent. <br>
<sup>11</sup> She is loud and defiant. <br>Her feet don’t stay in her house. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, <br>and lurking at every corner. <br>
<sup>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him. <br>With an impudent face she said to him: <br>
<sup>14</sup> “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. <br>Today I have paid my vows. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Therefore I came out to meet you, <br>to diligently seek your face, <br>and I have found you. <br>
<sup>16</sup> I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, <br>with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. <br>
<sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning. <br>Let’s solace ourselves with loving. <br>
<sup>19</sup> For my husband isn’t at home. <br>He has gone on a long journey. <br>
<sup>20</sup> He has taken a bag of money with him. <br>He will come home at the full moon.” <br>
<sup>21</sup> With persuasive words, she led him astray. <br>With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him. <br>
<sup>22</sup> He followed her immediately, <br>as an ox goes to the slaughter, <br>as a fool stepping into a noose. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Until an arrow strikes through his liver, <br>as a bird hurries to the snare, <br>and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.

<sup>24</sup> Now therefore, sons, listen to me. <br>Pay attention to the words of my mouth. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t let your heart turn to her ways. <br>Don’t go astray in her paths, <br>
<sup>26</sup> for she has thrown down many wounded. <br>Yes, all her slain are a mighty army. <br>
<sup>27</sup> <sup>a</sup><br>going down to the rooms of death.

> - <sup>a</sup> 27. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Doesn’t wisdom cry out? <br>Doesn’t understanding raise her voice? <br>
<sup>2</sup> On the top of high places by the way, <br>where the paths meet, she stands. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, <br>at the entry doors, she cries aloud: <br>
<sup>4</sup> “I call to you men! <br>I send my voice to the sons of mankind. <br>
<sup>5</sup> You simple, understand prudence! <br>You fools, be of an understanding heart! <br>
<sup>6</sup> Hear, for I will speak excellent things. <br>The opening of my lips is for right things. <br>
<sup>7</sup> For my mouth speaks truth. <br>Wickedness is an abomination to my lips. <br>
<sup>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. <br>There is nothing crooked or perverse in them. <br>
<sup>9</sup> They are all plain to him who understands, <br>right to those who find knowledge. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Receive my instruction rather than silver, <br>knowledge rather than choice gold. <br>
<sup>11</sup> For wisdom is better than rubies. <br>All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.

<sup>12</sup> “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling. <br>Find out knowledge and discretion. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil. <br>I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Counsel and sound knowledge are mine. <br>I have understanding and power. <br>
<sup>15</sup> By me kings reign, <br>and princes decree justice. <br>
<sup>16</sup> By me princes rule, <br>nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth. <br>
<sup>17</sup> I love those who love me. <br>Those who seek me diligently will find me. <br>
<sup>18</sup> With me are riches, honor, <br>enduring wealth, and prosperity. <br>
<sup>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold, <br>my yield than choice silver. <br>
<sup>20</sup> I walk in the way of righteousness, <br>in the middle of the paths of justice, <br>
<sup>21</sup> that I may give wealth to those who love me. <br>I fill their treasuries.

<sup>22</sup> “Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work, <br>before his deeds of old. <br>
<sup>23</sup> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, <br>before the earth existed. <br>
<sup>24</sup> When there were no depths, I was born, <br>when there were no springs abounding with water. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were settled in place, <br>before the hills, I was born; <br>
<sup>26</sup> while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, <br>nor the beginning of the dust of the world. <br>
<sup>27</sup> When he established the heavens, I was there. <br>When he set a circle on the surface of the deep, <br>
<sup>28</sup> when he established the clouds above, <br>when the springs of the deep became strong, <br>
<sup>29</sup> when he gave to the sea its boundary, <br>that the waters should not violate his commandment, <br>when he marked out the foundations of the earth, <br>
<sup>30</sup> then I was the craftsman by his side. <br>I was a delight day by day, <br>always rejoicing before him, <br>
<sup>31</sup> rejoicing in his whole world. <br>My delight was with the sons of men.

<sup>32</sup> “Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, <br>for blessed are those who keep my ways. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise. <br>Don’t refuse it. <br>
<sup>34</sup> Blessed is the man who hears me, <br>watching daily at my gates, <br>waiting at my door posts. <br>
<sup>35</sup> For whoever finds me finds life, <br>and will obtain favor from Yahweh. <br>
<sup>36</sup> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. <br>All those who hate me love death.”
## Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Wisdom has built her house. <br>She has carved out her seven pillars. <br>
<sup>2</sup> She has prepared her meat. <br>She has mixed her wine. <br>She has also set her table. <br>
<sup>3</sup> She has sent out her maidens. <br>She cries from the highest places of the city: <br>
<sup>4</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” <br>As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him, <br>
<sup>5</sup> “Come, eat some of my bread, <br>Drink some of the wine which I have mixed! <br>
<sup>6</sup> Leave your simple ways, and live. <br>Walk in the way of understanding.”

<sup>7</sup> One who corrects a mocker invites insult. <br>One who reproves a wicked man invites abuse. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you. <br>Reprove a wise person, and he will love you. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser. <br>Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. <br>The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. <br>
<sup>11</sup> For by me your days will be multiplied. <br>The years of your life will be increased. <br>
<sup>12</sup> If you are wise, you are wise for yourself. <br>If you mock, you alone will bear it.

<sup>13</sup> The foolish woman is loud, <br>undisciplined, and knows nothing. <br>
<sup>14</sup> She sits at the door of her house, <br>on a seat in the high places of the city, <br>
<sup>15</sup> to call to those who pass by, <br>who go straight on their ways, <br>
<sup>16</sup> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.” <br>As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him, <br>
<sup>17</sup> “Stolen water is sweet. <br>Food eaten in secret is pleasant.” <br>
<sup>18</sup> But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there, <br><sup>a</sup>

## Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> The plans of the heart belong to man, <br>but the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh. <br>

<sup>11</sup> Honest balances and scales are Yahweh’s; <br>all the weights in the bag are his work. <br>
<sup>12</sup> It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, <br>for the throne is established by righteousness. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Righteous lips are the delight of kings. <br>They value one who speaks the truth. <br>
<sup>14</sup> The king’s wrath is a messenger of death, <br>but a wise man will pacify it. <br>
<sup>15</sup> In the light of the king’s face is life. <br>His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain. <br>
<sup>16</sup> How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! <br>Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil. <br>He who keeps his way preserves his soul. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Pride goes before destruction, <br>and an arrogant spirit before a fall. <br>
<sup>19</sup> It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, <br>than to divide the plunder with the proud. <br>
<sup>20</sup> He who heeds the Word finds prosperity. <br>Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed. <br>
<sup>21</sup> The wise in heart shall be called prudent. <br>Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it, <br>but the punishment of fools is their folly. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, <br>and adds learning to his lips. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are a honeycomb, <br>sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. <br>
<sup>25</sup> There is a way which seems right to a man, <br>but in the end it leads to death. <br>
<sup>26</sup> The appetite of the laboring man labors for him, <br>for his mouth urges him on. <br>
<sup>27</sup> A worthless man devises mischief. <br>His speech is like a scorching fire. <br>
<sup>28</sup> A perverse man stirs up strife. <br>A whisperer separates close friends. <br>
<sup>29</sup> A man of violence entices his neighbor, <br>and leads him in a way that is not good. <br>
<sup>30</sup> One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, <br>one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Gray hair is a crown of glory. <br>It is attained by a life of righteousness. <br>
<sup>32</sup> One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; <br>one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city. <br>
<sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap, <br>but its every decision is from Yahweh.
## Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> Better is a dry morsel with quietness, <br>than a house full of feasting with strife. <br>
<sup>2</sup> A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame, <br>and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, <br>but Yahweh tests the hearts. <br>
<sup>4</sup> An evildoer heeds wicked lips. <br>A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker. <br>He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Children’s children are the crown of old men; <br>the glory of children is their parents. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Excellent speech isn’t fitting for a fool, <br>much less do lying lips fit a prince. <br>
<sup>8</sup> A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it; <br>wherever he turns, he prospers. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He who covers an offense promotes love; <br>but he who repeats a matter separates best friends. <br>
<sup>10</sup> A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding <br>than a hundred lashes into a fool. <br>
<sup>11</sup> An evil man seeks only rebellion; <br>therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man, <br>rather than a fool in his folly. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Whoever rewards evil for good, <br>evil shall not depart from his house. <br>
<sup>14</sup> The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, <br>therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out. <br>
<sup>15</sup> He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, <br>both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, <br>since he has no understanding? <br>
<sup>17</sup> A friend loves at all times; <br>and a brother is born for adversity. <br>
<sup>18</sup> A man void of understanding strikes hands, <br>and becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor. <br>
<sup>19</sup> He who loves disobedience loves strife. <br>One who builds a high gate seeks destruction. <br>
<sup>20</sup> One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity, <br>and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble. <br>
<sup>21</sup> He who becomes the father of a fool grieves. <br>The father of a fool has no joy. <br>
<sup>22</sup> A cheerful heart makes good medicine, <br>but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. <br>
<sup>23</sup> A wicked man receives a bribe in secret, <br>to pervert the ways of justice. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding, <br>but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth. <br>
<sup>25</sup> A foolish son brings grief to his father, <br>and bitterness to her who bore him. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Also to punish the righteous is not good, <br>nor to flog officials for their integrity. <br>
<sup>27</sup> He who spares his words has knowledge. <br>He who is even tempered is a man of understanding. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise. <br>When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.
## Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> A man who isolates himself pursues selfishness, <br>and defies all sound judgment. <br>
<sup>2</sup> A fool has no delight in understanding, <br>but only in revealing his own opinion. <br>
<sup>3</sup> When wickedness comes, contempt also comes, <br>and with shame comes disgrace. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters. <br>The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook. <br>
<sup>5</sup> To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good, <br>nor to deprive the innocent of justice. <br>
<sup>6</sup> A fool’s lips come into strife, <br>and his mouth invites beatings. <br>
<sup>7</sup> A fool’s mouth is his destruction, <br>and his lips are a snare to his soul. <br>
<sup>8</sup> The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels: <br>they go down into a person’s innermost parts. <br>
<sup>9</sup> One who is slack in his work <br>is brother to him who is a master of destruction. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Yahweh’s name is a strong tower: <br>the righteous run to him, and are safe. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, <br>like an unscalable wall in his own imagination. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is proud, <br>but before honor is humility. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He who answers before he hears, <br>that is folly and shame to him. <br>
<sup>14</sup> A man’s spirit will sustain him in sickness, <br>but a crushed spirit, who can bear? <br>
<sup>15</sup> The heart of the discerning gets knowledge. <br>The ear of the wise seeks knowledge. <br>
<sup>16</sup> A man’s gift makes room for him, <br>and brings him before great men. <br>
<sup>17</sup> He who pleads his cause first seems right— <br>until another comes and questions him. <br>
<sup>18</sup> The lot settles disputes, <br>and keeps strong ones apart. <br>
<sup>19</sup> A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city. <br>Disputes are like the bars of a fortress. <br>
<sup>20</sup> A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth. <br>With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue; <br>those who love it will eat its fruit. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, <br>and obtains favor of Yahweh. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The poor plead for mercy, <br>but the rich answer harshly. <br>
<sup>24</sup> A man of many companions may be ruined, <br>but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
## Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity <br>than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool. <br>
<sup>2</sup> It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge, <br>nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the way. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The foolishness of man subverts his way; <br>his heart rages against Yahweh. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Wealth adds many friends, <br>but the poor is separated from his friend. <br>
<sup>5</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished. <br>He who pours out lies shall not go free. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, <br>and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. <br>
<sup>7</sup> All the relatives of the poor shun him; <br>how much more do his friends avoid him! <br>He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. <br>He who keeps understanding shall find good. <br>
<sup>9</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished. <br>He who utters lies shall perish. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, <br>much less for a servant to have rule over princes. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger. <br>It is his glory to overlook an offense. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion, <br>but his favor is like dew on the grass. <br>
<sup>13</sup> A foolish son is the calamity of his father. <br>A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping. <br>
<sup>14</sup> House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, <br>but a prudent wife is from Yahweh. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. <br>The idle soul shall suffer hunger. <br>
<sup>16</sup> He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, <br>but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die. <br>
<sup>17</sup> He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; <br>he will reward him. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Discipline your son, for there is hope; <br>don’t be a willing party to his death. <br>
<sup>19</sup> A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, <br>for if you rescue him, you must do it again. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Listen to counsel and receive instruction, <br>that you may be wise in your latter end. <br>
<sup>21</sup> There are many plans in a man’s heart, <br>but Yahweh’s counsel will prevail. <br>
<sup>22</sup> That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness. <br>A poor man is better than a liar. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; <br>he rests and will not be touched by trouble. <br>
<sup>24</sup> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; <br>he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; <br>rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge. <br>
<sup>26</sup> He who robs his father and drives away his mother <br>is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. <br>
<sup>27</sup> If you stop listening to instruction, my son, <br>you will stray from the words of knowledge. <br>
<sup>28</sup> A corrupt witness mocks justice, <br>and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Penalties are prepared for scoffers, <br>and beatings for the backs of fools.
## Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler. <br>Whoever is led astray by them is not wise. <br>
<sup>2</sup> The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion. <br>He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life. <br>
<sup>3</sup> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife, <br>but every fool will be quarreling. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; <br>therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, <br>but a man of understanding will draw it out. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Many men claim to be men of unfailing love, <br>but who can find a faithful man? <br>
<sup>7</sup> A righteous man walks in integrity. <br>Blessed are his children after him. <br>
<sup>8</sup> A king who sits on the throne of judgment <br>scatters away all evil with his eyes. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Who can say, “I have made my heart pure. <br>I am clean and without sin”? <br>
<sup>10</sup> Differing weights and differing measures, <br>both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Even a child makes himself known by his doings, <br>whether his work is pure, and whether it is right. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, <br>Yahweh has made even both of them. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty. <br>Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread. <br>
<sup>14</sup> “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer; <br>but when he is gone his way, then he boasts. <br>
<sup>15</sup> There is gold and abundance of rubies, <br>but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger; <br>and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, <br>but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Plans are established by advice; <br>by wise guidance you wage war! <br>
<sup>19</sup> He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets; <br>therefore don’t keep company with him who opens wide his lips. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Whoever curses his father or his mother, <br>his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness. <br>
<sup>21</sup> An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning <br>won’t be blessed in the end. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.” <br>Wait for Yahweh, and he will save you. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Yahweh detests differing weights, <br>and dishonest scales are not pleasing. <br>
<sup>24</sup> A man’s steps are from Yahweh; <br>how then can man understand his way? <br>
<sup>25</sup> It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication, <br>then later to consider his vows. <br>
<sup>26</sup> A wise king winnows out the wicked, <br>and drives the threshing wheel over them. <br>
<sup>27</sup> The spirit of man is Yahweh’s lamp, <br>searching all his innermost parts. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Love and faithfulness keep the king safe. <br>His throne is sustained by love. <br>
<sup>29</sup> The glory of young men is their strength. <br>The splendor of old men is their gray hair. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Wounding blows cleanse away evil, <br>and beatings purge the innermost parts.
## Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> The king’s heart is in Yahweh’s hand like the watercourses. <br>He turns it wherever he desires. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, <br>but Yahweh weighs the hearts. <br>
<sup>3</sup> To do righteousness and justice <br>is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice. <br>
<sup>4</sup> A high look and a proud heart, <br>the lamp of the wicked, is sin. <br>
<sup>5</sup> The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; <br>and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Getting treasures by a lying tongue <br>is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The violence of the wicked will drive them away, <br>because they refuse to do what is right. <br>
<sup>8</sup> The way of the guilty is devious, <br>but the conduct of the innocent is upright. <br>
<sup>9</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop <br>than to share a house with a contentious woman. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked desires evil; <br>his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes. <br>
<sup>11</sup> When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom. <br>When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, <br>and brings the wicked to ruin. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, <br>he will also cry out, but shall not be heard. <br>
<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret pacifies anger, <br>and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath. <br>
<sup>15</sup> It is joy to the righteous to do justice; <br>but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The man who wanders out of the way of understanding <br>shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits. <br>
<sup>17</sup> He who loves pleasure will be a poor man. <br>He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich. <br>
<sup>18</sup> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, <br>the treacherous for the upright. <br>
<sup>19</sup> It is better to dwell in a desert land, <br>than with a contentious and fretful woman. <br>
<sup>20</sup> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise, <br>but a foolish man swallows it up. <br>
<sup>21</sup> He who follows after righteousness and kindness <br>finds life, righteousness, and honor. <br>
<sup>22</sup> A wise man scales the city of the mighty, <br>and brings down the strength of its confidence. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue <br>keeps his soul from troubles. <br>
<sup>24</sup> The proud and arrogant man—“Scoffer” is his name— <br>he works in the arrogance of pride. <br>
<sup>25</sup> The desire of the sluggard kills him, <br>for his hands refuse to labor. <br>
<sup>26</sup> There are those who covet greedily all day long; <br>but the righteous give and don’t withhold. <br>
<sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination— <br>how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind! <br>
<sup>28</sup> A false witness will perish. <br>A man who listens speaks to eternity. <br>
<sup>29</sup> A wicked man hardens his face; <br>but as for the upright, he establishes his ways. <br>
<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom nor understanding <br>nor counsel against Yahweh. <br>
<sup>31</sup> The horse is prepared for the day of battle; <br>but victory is with Yahweh.
## Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> A good name is more desirable than great riches, <br>and loving favor is better than silver and gold. <br>
<sup>2</sup> The rich and the poor have this in common: <br>Yahweh is the maker of them all. <br>
<sup>3</sup> A prudent man sees danger and hides himself; <br>but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh <br>is wealth, honor, and life. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked; <br>whoever guards his soul stays from them. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Train up a child in the way he should go, <br>and when he is old he will not depart from it. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The rich rule over the poor. <br>The borrower is servant to the lender. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, <br>and the rod of his fury will be destroyed. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He who has a generous eye will be blessed, <br>for he shares his food with the poor. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; <br>yes, quarrels and insults will stop. <br>
<sup>11</sup> He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully <br>is the king’s friend. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Yahweh’s eyes watch over knowledge, <br>but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside! <br>I will be killed in the streets!” <br>
<sup>14</sup> The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit. <br>He who is under Yahweh’s wrath will fall into it. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child; <br>the rod of discipline drives it far from him. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich, <br>both come to poverty.

<sup>17</sup> Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise. <br>Apply your heart to my teaching. <br>
<sup>18</sup> For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you, <br>if all of them are ready on your lips. <br>
<sup>19</sup> I teach you today, even you, <br>so that your trust may be in Yahweh. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things <br>of counsel and knowledge, <br>
<sup>21</sup> To teach you truth, reliable words, <br>to give sound answers to the ones who sent you?

<sup>22</sup> Don’t exploit the poor because he is poor; <br>and don’t crush the needy in court; <br>
<sup>23</sup> for Yahweh will plead their case, <br>and plunder the life of those who plunder them.

<sup>24</sup> Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man. <br>Don’t associate with one who harbors anger, <br>
<sup>25</sup> lest you learn his ways <br>and ensnare your soul.

<sup>26</sup> Don’t you be one of those who strike hands, <br>of those who are collateral for debts. <br>
<sup>27</sup> If you don’t have means to pay, <br>why should he take away your bed from under you?

<sup>28</sup> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone <br>which your fathers have set up.

<sup>29</sup> Do you see a man skilled in his work? <br>He will serve kings. <br>He won’t serve obscure men.
## Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> When you sit to eat with a ruler, <br>consider diligently what is before you; <br>
<sup>2</sup> put a knife to your throat <br>if you are a man given to appetite. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t be desirous of his dainties, <br>since they are deceitful food. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t weary yourself to be rich. <br>In your wisdom, show restraint. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Why do you set your eyes on that which is not? <br>For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, <br>and don’t crave his delicacies, <br>
<sup>7</sup> for as he thinks about the cost, so he is. <br>“Eat and drink!” he says to you, <br>but his heart is not with you. <br>
<sup>8</sup> You will vomit up the morsel which you have eaten <br>and waste your pleasant words.

<sup>9</sup> Don’t speak in the ears of a fool, <br>for he will despise the wisdom of your words.

<sup>10</sup> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone. <br>Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless, <br>
<sup>11</sup> for their Defender is strong. <br>He will plead their case against you.

<sup>12</sup> Apply your heart to instruction, <br>and your ears to the words of knowledge. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Don’t withhold correction from a child. <br>If you punish him with the rod, he will not die. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Punish him with the rod, <br><sup>a</sup>

<sup>15</sup> My son, if your heart is wise, <br>then my heart will be glad, even mine. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Yes, my heart will rejoice <br>when your lips speak what is right. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t let your heart envy sinners, <br>but rather fear Yahweh all day long. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Indeed surely there is a future hope, <br>and your hope will not be cut off. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Listen, my son, and be wise, <br>and keep your heart on the right path! <br>
<sup>20</sup> Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine, <br>or those who gorge themselves on meat; <br>
<sup>21</sup> for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor; <br>and drowsiness clothes them in rags. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Listen to your father who gave you life, <br>and don’t despise your mother when she is old. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Buy the truth, and don’t sell it. <br>Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding. <br>
<sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous has great joy. <br>Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Let your father and your mother be glad! <br>Let her who bore you rejoice! <br>
<sup>26</sup> My son, give me your heart; <br>and let your eyes keep in my ways. <br>
<sup>27</sup> For a prostitute is a deep pit; <br>and a wayward wife is a narrow well. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, <br>and increases the unfaithful among men.

<sup>29</sup> Who has woe? <br>Who has sorrow? <br>Who has strife? <br>Who has complaints? <br>Who has needless bruises? <br>Who has bloodshot eyes? <br>
<sup>30</sup> Those who stay long at the wine; <br>those who go to seek out mixed wine. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Don’t look at the wine when it is red, <br>when it sparkles in the cup, <br>when it goes down smoothly. <br>
<sup>32</sup> In the end, it bites like a snake, <br>and poisons like a viper. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Your eyes will see strange things, <br>and your mind will imagine confusing things. <br>
<sup>34</sup> Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea, <br>or as he who lies on top of the rigging: <br>
<sup>35</sup> “They hit me, and I was not hurt! <br>They beat me, and I don’t feel it! <br>When will I wake up? I can do it again. <br>I will look for more.”

> - <sup>a</sup> 14. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> Don’t be envious of evil men, <br>neither desire to be with them; <br>
<sup>2</sup> for their hearts plot violence <br>and their lips talk about mischief. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Through wisdom a house is built; <br>by understanding it is established; <br>
<sup>4</sup> by knowledge the rooms are filled <br>with all rare and beautiful treasure. <br>
<sup>5</sup> A wise man has great power. <br>A knowledgeable man increases strength, <br>
<sup>6</sup> for by wise guidance you wage your war, <br>and victory is in many advisors. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Wisdom is too high for a fool. <br>He doesn’t open his mouth in the gate. <br>
<sup>8</sup> One who plots to do evil <br>will be called a schemer. <br>
<sup>9</sup> The schemes of folly are sin. <br>The mocker is detested by men. <br>
<sup>10</sup> If you falter in the time of trouble, <br>your strength is small. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Rescue those who are being led away to death! <br>Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter! <br>
<sup>12</sup> If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this,” <br>doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it? <br>He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it? <br>Shall he not render to every man according to his work? <br>
<sup>13</sup> My son, eat honey, for it is good, <br>the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste; <br>
<sup>14</sup> so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul. <br>If you have found it, then there will be a reward: <br>Your hope will not be cut off. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous. <br>Don’t destroy his resting place; <br>
<sup>16</sup> for a righteous man falls seven times and rises up again, <br>but the wicked are overthrown by calamity. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls. <br>Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown, <br>
<sup>18</sup> lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him, <br>and he turn away his wrath from him. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers, <br>neither be envious of the wicked; <br>
<sup>20</sup> for there will be no reward to the evil man. <br>The lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out. <br>
<sup>21</sup> My son, fear Yahweh and the king. <br>Don’t join those who are rebellious, <br>
<sup>22</sup> for their calamity will rise suddenly. <br>Who knows what destruction may come from them both?

<sup>23</sup> These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good. <br>
<sup>24</sup> He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,” <br>peoples will curse him, and nations will abhor him— <br>
<sup>25</sup> but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, <br>and a rich blessing will come on them. <br>
<sup>26</sup> An honest answer <br>is like a kiss on the lips. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Prepare your work outside, <br>and get your fields ready. <br>Afterwards, build your house. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Don’t be a witness against your neighbor without cause. <br>Don’t deceive with your lips. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; <br>I will repay the man according to his work.” <br>
<sup>30</sup> I went by the field of the sluggard, <br>by the vineyard of the man void of understanding. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Behold, it was all grown over with thorns. <br>Its surface was covered with nettles, <br>and its stone wall was broken down. <br>
<sup>32</sup> Then I saw, and considered well. <br>I saw, and received instruction: <br>
<sup>33</sup> a little sleep, a little slumber, <br>a little folding of the hands to sleep, <br>
<sup>34</sup> so your poverty will come as a robber <br>and your want as an armed man.
## Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. <br>
<sup>2</sup> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, <br>but the glory of kings is to search out a matter. <br>
<sup>3</sup> As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, <br>so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Take away the dross from the silver, <br>and material comes out for the refiner. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Take away the wicked from the king’s presence, <br>and his throne will be established in righteousness. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king, <br>or claim a place among great men; <br>
<sup>7</sup> for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,” <br>than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, <br>whom your eyes have seen. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court. <br>What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you? <br>
<sup>9</sup> Debate your case with your neighbor, <br>and don’t betray the confidence of another, <br>
<sup>10</sup> lest one who hears it put you to shame, <br>and your bad reputation never depart.

<sup>11</sup> A word fitly spoken <br>is like apples of gold in settings of silver. <br>
<sup>12</sup> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <br>so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear. <br>
<sup>13</sup> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <br>so is a faithful messenger to those who send him; <br>for he refreshes the soul of his masters. <br>
<sup>14</sup> As clouds and wind without rain, <br>so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively. <br>
<sup>15</sup> By patience a ruler is persuaded. <br>A soft tongue breaks the bone. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Have you found honey? <br>Eat as much as is sufficient for you, <br>lest you eat too much, and vomit it. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house, <br>lest he be weary of you, and hate you. <br>
<sup>18</sup> A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor <br>is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble <br>is like a bad tooth or a lame foot. <br>
<sup>20</sup> As one who takes away a garment in cold weather, <br>or vinegar on soda, <br>so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. <br>
<sup>21</sup> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat. <br>If he is thirsty, give him water to drink; <br>
<sup>22</sup> for you will heap coals of fire on his head, <br>and Yahweh will reward you. <br>
<sup>23</sup> The north wind produces rain; <br>so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face. <br>
<sup>24</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop <br>than to share a house with a contentious woman. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Like cold water to a thirsty soul, <br>so is good news from a far country. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Like a muddied spring and a polluted well, <br>so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked. <br>
<sup>27</sup> It is not good to eat much honey, <br>nor is it honorable to seek one’s own honor. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Like a city that is broken down and without walls <br>is a man whose spirit is without restraint.
## Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, <br>so honor is not fitting for a fool. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Like a fluttering sparrow, <br>like a darting swallow, <br>so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest. <br>
<sup>3</sup> A whip is for the horse, <br>a bridle for the donkey, <br>and a rod for the back of fools! <br>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t answer a fool according to his folly, <br>lest you also be like him. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly, <br>lest he be wise in his own eyes. <br>
<sup>6</sup> One who sends a message by the hand of a fool <br>is cutting off feet and drinking violence. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Like the legs of the lame that hang loose, <br>so is a parable in the mouth of fools. <br>
<sup>8</sup> As one who binds a stone in a sling, <br>so is he who gives honor to a fool. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard, <br>so is a parable in the mouth of fools. <br>
<sup>10</sup> As an archer who wounds all, <br>so is he who hires a fool <br>or he who hires those who pass by. <br>
<sup>11</sup> As a dog that returns to his vomit, <br>so is a fool who repeats his folly. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? <br>There is more hope for a fool than for him. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road! <br>A fierce lion roams the streets!” <br>
<sup>14</sup> As the door turns on its hinges, <br>so does the sluggard on his bed. <br>
<sup>15</sup> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish. <br>He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes <br>than seven men who answer with discretion. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Like one who grabs a dog’s ears <br>is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death, <br>
<sup>19</sup> is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “Am I not joking?” <br>
<sup>20</sup> For lack of wood a fire goes out. <br>Without gossip, a quarrel dies down. <br>
<sup>21</sup> As coals are to hot embers, <br>and wood to fire, <br>so is a contentious man to kindling strife. <br>
<sup>22</sup> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, <br>they go down into the innermost parts. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Like silver dross on an earthen vessel <br>are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart. <br>
<sup>24</sup> A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, <br>but he harbors evil in his heart. <br>
<sup>25</sup> When his speech is charming, don’t believe him, <br>for there are seven abominations in his heart. <br>
<sup>26</sup> His malice may be concealed by deception, <br>but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it. <br>Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him. <br>
<sup>28</sup> A lying tongue hates those it hurts; <br>and a flattering mouth works ruin.
## Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Don’t boast about tomorrow; <br>for you don’t know what a day may bring. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Let another man praise you, <br>and not your own mouth; <br>a stranger, and not your own lips. <br>
<sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy, <br>and sand is a burden; <br>but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel, <br>and anger is overwhelming; <br>but who is able to stand before jealousy? <br>
<sup>5</sup> Better is open rebuke <br>than hidden love. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The wounds of a friend are faithful, <br>although the kisses of an enemy are profuse. <br>
<sup>7</sup> A full soul loathes a honeycomb; <br>but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet. <br>
<sup>8</sup> As a bird that wanders from her nest, <br>so is a man who wanders from his home. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; <br>so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend. <br>Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster. <br>A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Be wise, my son, <br>and bring joy to my heart, <br>then I can answer my tormentor. <br>
<sup>12</sup> A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; <br>but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger. <br>Hold it for a wayward woman! <br>
<sup>14</sup> He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, <br>it will be taken as a curse by him. <br>
<sup>15</sup> A continual dropping on a rainy day <br>and a contentious wife are alike: <br>
<sup>16</sup> restraining her is like restraining the wind, <br>or like grasping oil in his right hand.

<sup>17</sup> Iron sharpens iron; <br>so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. <br>He who looks after his master shall be honored. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Like water reflects a face, <br>so a man’s heart reflects the man. <br>
<sup>20</sup> <sup>a</sup>and Abaddon are never satisfied; <br>and a man’s eyes are never satisfied. <br>
<sup>21</sup> The crucible is for silver, <br>and the furnace for gold; <br>but man is refined by his praise. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, <br>yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.

<sup>23</sup> Know well the state of your flocks, <br>and pay attention to your herds, <br>
<sup>24</sup> for riches are not forever, <br>nor does the crown endure to all generations. <br>
<sup>25</sup> The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, <br>the grasses of the hills are gathered in. <br>
<sup>26</sup> The lambs are for your clothing, <br>and the goats are the price of a field. <br>
<sup>27</sup> There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food, <br>for your family’s food, <br>and for the nourishment of your servant girls.

## Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> The wicked flee when no one pursues; <br>but the righteous are as bold as a lion. <br>
<sup>2</sup> In rebellion, a land has many rulers, <br>but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge. <br>
<sup>3</sup> A needy man who oppresses the poor <br>is like a driving rain which leaves no crops. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; <br>but those who keep the law contend with them. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Evil men don’t understand justice; <br>but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity <br>than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; <br>but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He who increases his wealth by excessive interest <br>gathers it for one who has pity on the poor. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, <br>even his prayer is an abomination. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, <br>he will fall into his own trap; <br>but the blameless will inherit good. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The rich man is wise in his own eyes; <br>but the poor who has understanding sees through him. <br>
<sup>12</sup> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; <br>but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper, <br>but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Blessed is the man who always fears; <br>but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble. <br>
<sup>15</sup> As a roaring lion or a charging bear, <br>so is a wicked ruler over helpless people. <br>
<sup>16</sup> A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment. <br>One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days. <br>
<sup>17</sup> A man who is tormented by blood guilt will be a fugitive until death. <br>No one will support him. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; <br>but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly. <br>
<sup>19</sup> One who works his land will have an abundance of food; <br>but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. <br>
<sup>20</sup> A faithful man is rich with blessings; <br>but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished. <br>
<sup>21</sup> To show partiality is not good, <br>yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread. <br>
<sup>22</sup> A stingy man hurries after riches, <br>and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him. <br>
<sup>23</sup> One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor <br>than one who flatters with the tongue. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,” <br>is a partner with a destroyer. <br>
<sup>25</sup> One who is greedy stirs up strife; <br>but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper. <br>
<sup>26</sup> One who trusts in himself is a fool; <br>but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe. <br>
<sup>27</sup> One who gives to the poor has no lack; <br>but one who closes his eyes will have many curses. <br>
<sup>28</sup> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; <br>but when they perish, the righteous thrive.
## Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck <br>will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy. <br>
<sup>2</sup> When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; <br>but when the wicked rule, the people groan. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father; <br>but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The king by justice makes the land stable, <br>but he who takes bribes tears it down. <br>
<sup>5</sup> A man who flatters his neighbor <br>spreads a net for his feet. <br>
<sup>6</sup> An evil man is snared by his sin, <br>but the righteous can sing and be glad. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The righteous care about justice for the poor. <br>The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Mockers stir up a city, <br>but wise men turn away anger. <br>
<sup>9</sup> If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, <br>the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity; <br>and they seek the life of the upright. <br>
<sup>11</sup> A fool vents all of his anger, <br>but a wise man brings himself under control. <br>
<sup>12</sup> If a ruler listens to lies, <br>all of his officials are wicked. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: <br>Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both. <br>
<sup>14</sup> The king who fairly judges the poor, <br>his throne shall be established forever. <br>
<sup>15</sup> The rod of correction gives wisdom, <br>but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother. <br>
<sup>16</sup> When the wicked increase, sin increases; <br>but the righteous will see their downfall. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Correct your son, and he will give you peace; <br>yes, he will bring delight to your soul. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; <br>but one who keeps the law is blessed. <br>
<sup>19</sup> A servant can’t be corrected by words. <br>Though he understands, yet he will not respond. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? <br>There is more hope for a fool than for him. <br>
<sup>21</sup> He who pampers his servant from youth <br>will have him become a son in the end. <br>
<sup>22</sup> An angry man stirs up strife, <br>and a wrathful man abounds in sin. <br>
<sup>23</sup> A man’s pride brings him low, <br>but one of lowly spirit gains honor. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul. <br>He takes an oath, but dares not testify. <br>
<sup>25</sup> The fear of man proves to be a snare, <br>but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Many seek the ruler’s favor, <br>but a man’s justice comes from Yahweh. <br>
<sup>27</sup> A dishonest man detests the righteous, <br>and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.
## Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the revelation: <br>the man says to Ithiel, <br>to Ithiel and Ucal: <br>
<sup>2</sup> “Surely I am the most ignorant man, <br>and don’t have a man’s understanding. <br>
<sup>3</sup> I have not learned wisdom, <br>neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended? <br>Who has gathered the wind in his fists? <br>Who has bound the waters in his garment? <br>Who has established all the ends of the earth? <br>What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you know?

<sup>5</sup> “Every word of God is flawless. <br>He is a shield to those who take refuge in him. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t you add to his words, <br>lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.

<sup>7</sup> “Two things I have asked of you. <br>Don’t deny me before I die. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Remove far from me falsehood and lies. <br>Give me neither poverty nor riches. <br>Feed me with the food that is needful for me, <br>
<sup>9</sup> lest I be full, deny you, and say, ‘Who is Yahweh?’ <br>or lest I be poor, and steal, <br>and so dishonor the name of my God.

<sup>10</sup> “Don’t slander a servant to his master, <br>lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.

<sup>11</sup> There is a generation that curses their father, <br>and doesn’t bless their mother. <br>
<sup>12</sup> There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes, <br>yet are not washed from their filthiness. <br>
<sup>13</sup> There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! <br>Their eyelids are lifted up. <br>
<sup>14</sup> There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, <br>and their jaws like knives, <br>to devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from among men.

<sup>15</sup> “The leech has two daughters: <br>‘Give, give.’ “There are three things that are never satisfied; <br>four that don’t say, ‘Enough!’: <br>
<sup>16</sup> <sup>a</sup><br>the barren womb, <br>the earth that is not satisfied with water, <br>and the fire that doesn’t say, ‘Enough!’

<sup>17</sup> “The eye that mocks at his father, <br>and scorns obedience to his mother, <br>the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, <br>the young eagles shall eat it.

<sup>18</sup> “There are three things which are too amazing for me, <br>four which I don’t understand: <br>
<sup>19</sup> The way of an eagle in the air, <br>the way of a serpent on a rock, <br>the way of a ship in the middle of the sea, <br>and the way of a man with a maiden.

<sup>20</sup> “So is the way of an adulterous woman: <br>She eats and wipes her mouth, <br>and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’

<sup>21</sup> “For three things the earth trembles, <br>and under four, it can’t bear up: <br>
<sup>22</sup> For a servant when he is king, <br>a fool when he is filled with food, <br>
<sup>23</sup> for an unloved woman when she is married, <br>and a servant who is heir to her mistress.

<sup>24</sup> “There are four things which are little on the earth, <br>but they are exceedingly wise: <br>
<sup>25</sup> The ants are not a strong people, <br>yet they provide their food in the summer. <br>
<sup>26</sup> The hyraxes are but a feeble folk, <br>yet make they their houses in the rocks. <br>
<sup>27</sup> The locusts have no king, <br>yet they advance in ranks. <br>
<sup>28</sup> You can catch a lizard with your hands, <br>yet it is in kings’ palaces.

<sup>29</sup> “There are three things which are stately in their march, <br>four which are stately in going: <br>
<sup>30</sup> The lion, which is mightiest among animals, <br>and doesn’t turn away for any; <br>
<sup>31</sup> the greyhound; <br>the male goat; <br>and the king against whom there is no rising up.

<sup>32</sup> “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, <br>or if you have thought evil, <br>put your hand over your mouth. <br>
<sup>33</sup> For as the churning of milk produces butter, <br>and the wringing of the nose produces blood, <br>so the forcing of wrath produces strife.”

## Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> The words of King Lemuel—the revelation which his mother taught him:

<sup>2</sup> “Oh, my son! <br>Oh, son of my womb! <br>Oh, son of my vows! <br>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t give your strength to women, <br>nor your ways to that which destroys kings. <br>
<sup>4</sup> It is not for kings, Lemuel, <br>it is not for kings to drink wine, <br>nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’ <br>
<sup>5</sup> lest they drink, and forget the law, <br>and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish, <br>and wine to the bitter in soul. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, <br>and remember his misery no more. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Open your mouth for the mute, <br>in the cause of all who are left desolate. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Open your mouth, judge righteously, <br>and serve justice to the poor and needy.”

<sup>10</sup> <sup>a</sup>Who can find a worthy woman? <br>For her value is far above rubies. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband trusts in her. <br>He shall have no lack of gain. <br>
<sup>12</sup> She does him good, and not harm, <br>all the days of her life. <br>
<sup>13</sup> She seeks wool and flax, <br>and works eagerly with her hands. <br>
<sup>14</sup> She is like the merchant ships. <br>She brings her bread from afar. <br>
<sup>15</sup> She rises also while it is yet night, <br>gives food to her household, <br>and portions for her servant girls. <br>
<sup>16</sup> She considers a field, and buys it. <br>With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard. <br>
<sup>17</sup> She arms her waist with strength, <br>and makes her arms strong. <br>
<sup>18</sup> She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. <br>Her lamp doesn’t go out by night. <br>
<sup>19</sup> She lays her hands to the distaff, <br>and her hands hold the spindle. <br>
<sup>20</sup> She opens her arms to the poor; <br>yes, she extends her hands to the needy. <br>
<sup>21</sup> She is not afraid of the snow for her household, <br>for all her household are clothed with scarlet. <br>
<sup>22</sup> She makes for herself carpets of tapestry. <br>Her clothing is fine linen and purple. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Her husband is respected in the gates, <br>when he sits among the elders of the land. <br>
<sup>24</sup> She makes linen garments and sells them, <br>and delivers sashes to the merchant. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Strength and dignity are her clothing. <br>She laughs at the time to come. <br>
<sup>26</sup> She opens her mouth with wisdom. <br>Kind instruction is on her tongue. <br>
<sup>27</sup> She looks well to the ways of her household, <br>and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Her children rise up and call her blessed. <br>Her husband also praises her: <br>
<sup>29</sup> “Many women do noble things, <br>but you excel them all.” <br>
<sup>30</sup> Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; <br>but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Give her of the fruit of her hands! <br>Let her works praise her in the gates!
