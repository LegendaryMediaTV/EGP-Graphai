## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked, <br>nor stand on the path of sinners, <br>nor sit in the seat of scoffers; <br>
<sup>2</sup> but his delight is in Yahweh’s<sup>a</sup> law. <br>On his law he meditates day and night. <br>
<sup>3</sup> He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, <br>that produces its fruit in its season, <br>whose leaf also does not wither. <br>Whatever he does shall prosper. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The wicked are not so, <br>but are like the chaff which the wind drives away. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, <br>nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. <br>
<sup>6</sup> For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, <br>but the way of the wicked shall perish.

> - <sup>a</sup> 2. “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.

## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rage, <br>and the peoples plot a vain thing? <br>
<sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth take a stand, <br>and the rulers take counsel together, <br>against Yahweh, and against his Anointed,<sup>a</sup> saying, <br>
<sup>3</sup> “Let’s break their bonds apart, <br>and cast their cords from us.” <br>
<sup>4</sup> He who sits in the heavens will laugh. <br>The Lord<sup>b</sup> will have them in derision. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Then he will speak to them in his anger, <br>and terrify them in his wrath: <br>
<sup>6</sup> “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.” <br>
<sup>7</sup> I will tell of the decree: <br>Yahweh said to me, “You are my son. <br>Today I have become your father. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, <br>the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession. <br>
<sup>9</sup> You shall break them with a rod of iron. <br>You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” <br>
<sup>10</sup> Now therefore be wise, you kings. <br>Be instructed, you judges of the earth. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Serve Yahweh with fear, <br>and rejoice with trembling. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Give sincere homage to the Son,<sup>c</sup> lest he be angry, and you perish on the way, <br>for his wrath will soon be kindled. <br>Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

> - <sup>a</sup> 2. The word “Anointed” is the same as the word for “Messiah” or “Christ”
> - <sup>b</sup> 4. The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
> - <sup>c</sup> 12. or, Kiss the son

## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! <br>Many are those who rise up against me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Many there are who say of my soul, <br>“There is no help for him in God.”<sup>a</sup> <br>Selah.

<sup>3</sup> But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, <br>my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. <br>
<sup>4</sup> I cry to Yahweh with my voice, <br>and he answers me out of his holy hill. <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> I laid myself down and slept. <br>I awakened, for Yahweh sustains me. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people <br>who have set themselves against me on every side. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Arise, Yahweh! <br>Save me, my God! <br>For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. <br>You have broken the teeth of the wicked. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Salvation belongs to Yahweh. <br>May your blessing be on your people. <br>Selah.

> - <sup>a</sup> 2. The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “[hebrew]אֱלֹהִ֑ים[/hebrew]” (Elohim).

## Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. <br>Give me relief from my distress. <br>Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer. <br>
<sup>2</sup> You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? <br>Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? <br>Selah.

<sup>3</sup> But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly; <br>Yahweh will hear when I call to him. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Stand in awe, and don’t sin. <br>Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. <br>Put your trust in Yahweh. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Many say, “Who will show us any good?” <br>Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us. <br>
<sup>7</sup> You have put gladness in my heart, <br>more than when their grain and their new wine are increased. <br>
<sup>8</sup> In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, <br>for you alone, Yahweh, make me live in safety.
## Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Give ear to my words, Yahweh. <br>Consider my meditation. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God, <br>for I pray to you. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice. <br>In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. <br>Evil can’t live with you. <br>
<sup>5</sup> The arrogant will not stand in your sight. <br>You hate all workers of iniquity. <br>
<sup>6</sup> You will destroy those who speak lies. <br>Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. <br>
<sup>7</sup> But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. <br>I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. <br>Make your way straight before my face. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. <br>Their heart is destruction. <br>Their throat is an open tomb. <br>They flatter with their tongue. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Hold them guilty, God. <br>Let them fall by their own counsels. <br>Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, <br>for they have rebelled against you. <br>
<sup>11</sup> But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice. <br>Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. <br>Let them also who love your name be joyful in you. <br>
<sup>12</sup> For you will bless the righteous. <br>Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield.
## Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger, <br>neither discipline me in your wrath. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. <br>Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled. <br>
<sup>3</sup> My soul is also in great anguish. <br>But you, Yahweh—how long? <br>
<sup>4</sup> Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, <br>and save me for your loving kindness’ sake. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For in death there is no memory of you. <br>In Sheol,<sup>a</sup> who shall give you thanks? <br>
<sup>6</sup> I am weary with my groaning. <br>Every night I flood my bed. <br>I drench my couch with my tears. <br>
<sup>7</sup> My eye wastes away because of grief. <br>It grows old because of all my adversaries. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, <br>for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Yahweh has heard my supplication. <br>Yahweh accepts my prayer. <br>
<sup>10</sup> May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. <br>They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.

> - <sup>a</sup> 5. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. <br>Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me, <br>
<sup>2</sup> lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, <br>ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, <br>if there is iniquity in my hands, <br>
<sup>4</sup> if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me <br>(yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary), <br>
<sup>5</sup> let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; <br>yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, <br>and lay my glory in the dust. <br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. <br>Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. <br>Awake for me. You have commanded judgment. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. <br>Rule over them on high. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. <br>Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, <br>and to my integrity that is in me. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, <br>but establish the righteous; <br>their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God. <br>
<sup>10</sup> My shield is with God, <br>who saves the upright in heart. <br>
<sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge, <br>yes, a God who has indignation every day. <br>
<sup>12</sup> If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword; <br>he has bent and strung his bow. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. <br>He makes ready his flaming arrows. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Behold,<sup>a</sup> he travails with iniquity. <br>Yes, he has conceived mischief, <br>and brought out falsehood. <br>
<sup>15</sup> He has dug a hole, <br>and has fallen into the pit which he made. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. <br>His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head. <br>
<sup>17</sup> I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, <br>and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.

> - <sup>a</sup> 14. “Behold”, from “[hebrew]הִנֵּה[/hebrew]”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.

## Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! <br>You have set your glory above the heavens! <br>
<sup>2</sup> From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, <br>because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger. <br>
<sup>3</sup> When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, <br>the moon and the stars, which you have ordained, <br>
<sup>4</sup> what is man, that you think of him? <br>What is the son of man, that you care for him? <br>
<sup>5</sup> For you have made him a little lower than the angels,<sup>a</sup> <br>and crowned him with glory and honor. <br>
<sup>6</sup> You make him ruler over the works of your hands. <br>You have put all things under his feet: <br>
<sup>7</sup> All sheep and cattle, <br>yes, and the animals of the field, <br>
<sup>8</sup> the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, <br>and whatever passes through the paths of the seas. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Yahweh, our Lord, <br>how majestic is your name in all the earth!

> - <sup>a</sup> 5. Hebrew: Elohim. The word Elohim, used here, usually means “God”, but can also mean “gods”, “princes”, or “angels”. The Septuagint reads “angels” here. See also the quote from the Septuagint in Hebrews 2:7.

## Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart. <br>I will tell of all your marvelous works. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in you. <br>I will sing praise to your name, O Most High. <br>
<sup>3</sup> When my enemies turn back, <br>they stumble and perish in your presence. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For you have maintained my just cause. <br>You sit on the throne judging righteously. <br>
<sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the nations. <br>You have destroyed the wicked. <br>You have blotted out their name forever and ever. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. <br>The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished. <br>
<sup>7</sup> But Yahweh reigns forever. <br>He has prepared his throne for judgment. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He will judge the world in righteousness. <br>He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed; <br>a high tower in times of trouble. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Those who know your name will put their trust in you, <br>for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion, <br>and declare among the people what he has done. <br>
<sup>12</sup> For he who avenges blood remembers them. <br>He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Have mercy on me, Yahweh. <br>See my affliction by those who hate me, <br>and lift me up from the gates of death, <br>
<sup>14</sup> that I may show all of your praise. <br>I will rejoice in your salvation in the gates of the daughter of Zion. <br>
<sup>15</sup> The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made. <br>In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Yahweh has made himself known. <br>He has executed judgment. <br>The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. <br>Meditation. Selah.

<sup>17</sup> The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,<sup>a</sup> <br>even all the nations that forget God. <br>
<sup>18</sup> For the needy shall not always be forgotten, <br>nor the hope of the poor perish forever. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Arise, Yahweh! Don’t let man prevail. <br>Let the nations be judged in your sight. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, Yahweh. <br>Let the nations know that they are only men. <br>Selah.

> - <sup>a</sup> 17. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Why do you stand far off, Yahweh? <br>Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? <br>
<sup>2</sup> In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. <br>They are caught in the schemes that they devise. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings. <br>He blesses the greedy and condemns Yahweh. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The wicked, in the pride of his face, <br>has no room in his thoughts for God. <br>
<sup>5</sup> His ways are prosperous at all times. <br>He is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight. <br>As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken. <br>For generations I shall have no trouble.” <br>
<sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. <br>Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He lies in wait near the villages. <br>From ambushes, he murders the innocent. <br>His eyes are secretly set against the helpless. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. <br>He lies in wait to catch the helpless. <br>He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The helpless are crushed. <br>They collapse. <br>They fall under his strength. <br>
<sup>11</sup> He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. <br>He hides his face. <br>He will never see it.”

<sup>12</sup> Arise, Yahweh! <br>God, lift up your hand! <br>Don’t forget the helpless. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Why does the wicked person condemn God, <br>and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account”? <br>
<sup>14</sup> But you do see trouble and grief. <br>You consider it to take it into your hand. <br>You help the victim and the fatherless. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked. <br>As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Yahweh is King forever and ever! <br>The nations will perish out of his land. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. <br>You will prepare their heart. <br>You will cause your ear to hear, <br>
<sup>18</sup> to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, <br>that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.
## Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> In Yahweh, I take refuge. <br>How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain”? <br>
<sup>2</sup> For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. <br>They set their arrows on the strings, <br>that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. <br>
<sup>3</sup> If the foundations are destroyed, <br>what can the righteous do? <br>
<sup>4</sup> Yahweh is in his holy temple. <br>Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. <br>His eyes observe. <br>His eyes examine the children of men. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Yahweh examines the righteous, <br>but his soul hates the wicked and him who loves violence. <br>
<sup>6</sup> On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; <br>fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. <br>
<sup>7</sup> For Yahweh is righteous. <br>He loves righteousness. <br>The upright shall see his face.
## Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. <br>For the faithful fail from among the children of men. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Everyone lies to his neighbor. <br>They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart. <br>
<sup>3</sup> May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, <br>and the tongue that boasts, <br>
<sup>4</sup> who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail. <br>Our lips are our own. <br>Who is lord over us?” <br>
<sup>5</sup> “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, <br>I will now arise,” says Yahweh; <br>“I will set him in safety from those who malign him.” <br>
<sup>6</sup> Yahweh’s words are flawless words, <br>as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times. <br>
<sup>7</sup> You will keep them, Yahweh. <br>You will preserve them from this generation forever. <br>
<sup>8</sup> The wicked walk on every side, <br>when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
## Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> How long, Yahweh? <br>Will you forget me forever? <br>How long will you hide your face from me? <br>
<sup>2</sup> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, <br>having sorrow in my heart every day? <br>How long shall my enemy triumph over me? <br>
<sup>3</sup> Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. <br>Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death; <br>
<sup>4</sup> lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;” <br>lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.

<sup>5</sup> But I trust in your loving kindness. <br>My heart rejoices in your salvation. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I will sing to Yahweh, <br>because he has been good to me.
## Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” <br>They are corrupt. <br>They have done abominable deeds. <br>There is no one who does good. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, <br>to see if there were any who understood, <br>who sought after God. <br>
<sup>3</sup> They have all gone aside. <br>They have together become corrupt. <br>There is no one who does good, no, not one. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, <br>who eat up my people as they eat bread, <br>and don’t call on Yahweh? <br>
<sup>5</sup> There they were in great fear, <br>for God is in the generation of the righteous. <br>
<sup>6</sup> You frustrate the plan of the poor, <br>because Yahweh is his refuge. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! <br>When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, <br>then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
## Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? <br>Who shall live on your holy hill? <br>
<sup>2</sup> He who walks blamelessly and does what is right, <br>and speaks truth in his heart; <br>
<sup>3</sup> he who doesn’t slander with his tongue, <br>nor does evil to his friend, <br>nor casts slurs against his fellow man; <br>
<sup>4</sup> in whose eyes a vile man is despised, <br>but who honors those who fear Yahweh; <br>he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change; <br>
<sup>5</sup> he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury, <br>nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken.
## Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> Preserve me, God, for I take refuge in you. <br>
<sup>2</sup> My soul, you have said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord. <br>Apart from you I have no good thing.” <br>
<sup>3</sup> As for the saints who are in the earth, <br>they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.

<sup>4</sup> Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god. <br>Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, <br>nor take their names on my lips. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup. <br>You made my lot secure.

<sup>6</sup> The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. <br>Yes, I have a good inheritance. <br>
<sup>7</sup> I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel. <br>Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons. <br>
<sup>8</sup> I have set Yahweh always before me. <br>Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices. <br>My body shall also dwell in safety. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,<sup>a</sup> <br>neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption. <br>
<sup>11</sup> You will show me the path of life. <br>In your presence is fullness of joy. <br>In your right hand there are pleasures forever more.

> - <sup>a</sup> 10. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea. <br>Give ear to my prayer that doesn’t go out of deceitful lips. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Let my sentence come out of your presence. <br>Let your eyes look on equity. <br>
<sup>3</sup> You have proved my heart. <br>You have visited me in the night. <br>You have tried me, and found nothing. <br>I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey. <br>
<sup>4</sup> As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips, <br>I have kept myself from the ways of the violent. <br>
<sup>5</sup> My steps have held fast to your paths. <br>My feet have not slipped. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I have called on you, for you will answer me, God. <br>Turn your ear to me. <br>Hear my speech. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Show your marvelous loving kindness, <br>you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Keep me as the apple of your eye. <br>Hide me under the shadow of your wings, <br>
<sup>9</sup> from the wicked who oppress me, <br>my deadly enemies, who surround me. <br>
<sup>10</sup> They close up their callous hearts. <br>With their mouth they speak proudly. <br>
<sup>11</sup> They have now surrounded us in our steps. <br>They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. <br>
<sup>12</sup> He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, <br>as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Arise, Yahweh, confront him. <br>Cast him down. <br>Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword, <br>
<sup>14</sup> from men by your hand, Yahweh, <br>from men of the world, whose portion is in this life. <br>You fill the belly of your cherished ones. <br>Your sons have plenty, <br>and they store up wealth for their children. <br>
<sup>15</sup> As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness. <br>I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.
## Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> I love you, Yahweh, my strength. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; <br>my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; <br>my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower. <br>
<sup>3</sup> I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; <br>and I am saved from my enemies. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The cords of death surrounded me. <br>The floods of ungodliness made me afraid. <br>
<sup>5</sup> The cords of Sheol<sup>a</sup> were around me. <br>The snares of death came on me. <br>
<sup>6</sup> In my distress I called on Yahweh, <br>and cried to my God. <br>He heard my voice out of his temple. <br>My cry before him came into his ears. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Then the earth shook and trembled. <br>The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, <br>because he was angry. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Smoke went out of his nostrils. <br>Consuming fire came out of his mouth. <br>Coals were kindled by it. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He bowed the heavens also, and came down. <br>Thick darkness was under his feet. <br>
<sup>10</sup> He rode on a cherub, and flew. <br>Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind. <br>
<sup>11</sup> He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him, <br>darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. <br>
<sup>12</sup> At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, <br>hailstones and coals of fire. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Yahweh also thundered in the sky. <br>The Most High uttered his voice: <br>hailstones and coals of fire. <br>
<sup>14</sup> He sent out his arrows, and scattered them. <br>He routed them with great lightning bolts. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Then the channels of waters appeared. <br>The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh, <br>at the blast of the breath of your nostrils. <br>
<sup>16</sup> He sent from on high. <br>He took me. <br>He drew me out of many waters. <br>
<sup>17</sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy, <br>from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me. <br>
<sup>18</sup> They came on me in the day of my calamity, <br>but Yahweh was my support. <br>
<sup>19</sup> He brought me out also into a large place. <br>He delivered me, because he delighted in me. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness. <br>According to the cleanness of my hands, he has recompensed me. <br>
<sup>21</sup> For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, <br>and have not wickedly departed from my God. <br>
<sup>22</sup> For all his ordinances were before me. <br>I didn’t put away his statutes from me. <br>
<sup>23</sup> I was also blameless with him. <br>I kept myself from my iniquity. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, <br>according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. <br>
<sup>25</sup> With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. <br>With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect. <br>
<sup>26</sup> With the pure, you will show yourself pure. <br>With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd. <br>
<sup>27</sup> For you will save the afflicted people, <br>but the arrogant eyes you will bring down. <br>
<sup>28</sup> For you will light my lamp, Yahweh. <br>My God will light up my darkness. <br>
<sup>29</sup> For by you, I advance through a troop. <br>By my God, I leap over a wall. <br>
<sup>30</sup> As for God, his way is perfect. <br>Yahweh’s word is tried. <br>He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him. <br>
<sup>31</sup> For who is God, except Yahweh? <br>Who is a rock, besides our God, <br>
<sup>32</sup> the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect? <br>
<sup>33</sup> He makes my feet like deer’s feet, <br>and sets me on my high places. <br>
<sup>34</sup> He teaches my hands to war, <br>so that my arms bend a bow of bronze. <br>
<sup>35</sup> You have also given me the shield of your salvation. <br>Your right hand sustains me. <br>Your gentleness has made me great. <br>
<sup>36</sup> You have enlarged my steps under me, <br>My feet have not slipped. <br>
<sup>37</sup> I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. <br>I won’t turn away until they are consumed. <br>
<sup>38</sup> I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. <br>They shall fall under my feet. <br>
<sup>39</sup> For you have armed me with strength to the battle. <br>You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. <br>
<sup>40</sup> You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, <br>that I might cut off those who hate me. <br>
<sup>41</sup> They cried, but there was no one to save; <br>even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them. <br>
<sup>42</sup> Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. <br>I cast them out as the mire of the streets. <br>
<sup>43</sup> You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. <br>You have made me the head of the nations. <br>A people whom I have not known shall serve me. <br>
<sup>44</sup> As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. <br>The foreigners shall submit themselves to me. <br>
<sup>45</sup> The foreigners shall fade away, <br>and shall come trembling out of their strongholds. <br>
<sup>46</sup> Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock. <br>Exalted be the God of my salvation, <br>
<sup>47</sup> even the God who executes vengeance for me, <br>and subdues peoples under me. <br>
<sup>48</sup> He rescues me from my enemies. <br>Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. <br>You deliver me from the violent man. <br>
<sup>49</sup> Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations, <br>and will sing praises to your name. <br>
<sup>50</sup> He gives great deliverance to his king, <br>and shows loving kindness to his anointed, <br>to David and to his offspring,<sup>b</sup> forever more.

## Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God. <br>The expanse shows his handiwork. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Day after day they pour out speech, <br>and night after night they display knowledge. <br>
<sup>3</sup> There is no speech nor language <br>where their voice is not heard. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Their voice has gone out through all the earth, <br>their words to the end of the world. <br>In them he has set a tent for the sun, <br>
<sup>5</sup> which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room, <br>like a strong man rejoicing to run his course. <br>
<sup>6</sup> His going out is from the end of the heavens, <br>his circuit to its ends. <br>There is nothing hidden from its heat.

<sup>7</sup> Yahweh’s law is perfect, restoring the soul. <br>Yahweh’s covenant is sure, making wise the simple. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart. <br>Yahweh’s commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes. <br>
<sup>9</sup> The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever. <br>Yahweh’s ordinances are true, and righteous altogether. <br>
<sup>10</sup> They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold, <br>sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Moreover your servant is warned by them. <br>In keeping them there is great reward. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Who can discern his errors? <br>Forgive me from hidden errors.

<sup>13</sup> Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. <br>Let them not have dominion over me. <br>Then I will be upright. <br>I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart <br>be acceptable in your sight, <br>Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
## Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. <br>May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high, <br>
<sup>2</sup> send you help from the sanctuary, <br>grant you support from Zion, <br>
<sup>3</sup> remember all your offerings, <br>and accept your burned sacrifice. <br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> May he grant you your heart’s desire, <br>and fulfill all your counsel. <br>
<sup>5</sup> We will triumph in your salvation. <br>In the name of our God, we will set up our banners. <br>May Yahweh grant all your requests. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed. <br>He will answer him from his holy heaven, <br>with the saving strength of his right hand. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, <br>but we trust in the name of Yahweh our God. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They are bowed down and fallen, <br>but we rise up, and stand upright. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Save, Yahweh! <br>Let the King answer us when we call!
## Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> The king rejoices in your strength, Yahweh! <br>How greatly he rejoices in your salvation! <br>
<sup>2</sup> You have given him his heart’s desire, <br>and have not withheld the request of his lips. <br>Selah.

<sup>3</sup> For you meet him with the blessings of goodness. <br>You set a crown of fine gold on his head. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He asked life of you and you gave it to him, <br>even length of days forever and ever. <br>
<sup>5</sup> His glory is great in your salvation. <br>You lay honor and majesty on him. <br>
<sup>6</sup> For you make him most blessed forever. <br>You make him glad with joy in your presence. <br>
<sup>7</sup> For the king trusts in Yahweh. <br>Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Your hand will find out all of your enemies. <br>Your right hand will find out those who hate you. <br>
<sup>9</sup> You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger. <br>Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath. <br>The fire shall devour them. <br>
<sup>10</sup> You will destroy their descendants from the earth, <br>their posterity from among the children of men. <br>
<sup>11</sup> For they intended evil against you. <br>They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed. <br>
<sup>12</sup> For you will make them turn their back, <br>when you aim drawn bows at their face. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength, <br>so we will sing and praise your power.
## Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? <br>Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning? <br>
<sup>2</sup> My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer; <br>in the night season, and am not silent. <br>
<sup>3</sup> But you are holy, <br>you who inhabit the praises of Israel. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Our fathers trusted in you. <br>They trusted, and you delivered them. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They cried to you, and were delivered. <br>They trusted in you, and were not disappointed. <br>
<sup>6</sup> But I am a worm, and no man; <br>a reproach of men, and despised by the people. <br>
<sup>7</sup> All those who see me mock me. <br>They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying, <br>
<sup>8</sup> “He trusts in Yahweh. <br>Let him deliver him. <br>Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.” <br>
<sup>9</sup> But you brought me out of the womb. <br>You made me trust while at my mother’s breasts. <br>
<sup>10</sup> I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb. <br>You are my God since my mother bore me. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near. <br>For there is no one to help. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Many bulls have surrounded me. <br>Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me. <br>
<sup>13</sup> They open their mouths wide against me, <br>lions tearing prey and roaring. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I am poured out like water. <br>All my bones are out of joint. <br>My heart is like wax. <br>It is melted within me. <br>
<sup>15</sup> My strength is dried up like a potsherd. <br>My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. <br>You have brought me into the dust of death. <br>
<sup>16</sup> For dogs have surrounded me. <br>A company of evildoers have enclosed me. <br>They have pierced my hands and feet.<sup>a</sup> <br>
<sup>17</sup> I can count all of my bones. <br>They look and stare at me. <br>
<sup>18</sup> They divide my garments among them. <br>They cast lots for my clothing.

<sup>19</sup> But don’t be far off, Yahweh. <br>You are my help. Hurry to help me! <br>
<sup>20</sup> Deliver my soul from the sword, <br>my precious life from the power of the dog. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Save me from the lion’s mouth! <br>Yes, you have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.

<sup>22</sup> I will declare your name to my brothers. <br>Among the assembly, I will praise you. <br>
<sup>23</sup> You who fear Yahweh, praise him! <br>All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him! <br>Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel! <br>
<sup>24</sup> For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, <br>neither has he hidden his face from him; <br>but when he cried to him, he heard.

<sup>25</sup> My praise of you comes in the great assembly. <br>I will pay my vows before those who fear him. <br>
<sup>26</sup> The humble shall eat and be satisfied. <br>They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him. <br>Let your hearts live forever. <br>
<sup>27</sup> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh. <br>All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you. <br>
<sup>28</sup> For the kingdom is Yahweh’s. <br>He is the ruler over the nations. <br>
<sup>29</sup> All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship. <br>All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him, <br>even he who can’t keep his soul alive. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Posterity shall serve him. <br>Future generations shall be told about the Lord. <br>
<sup>31</sup> They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born, <br>for he has done it.

## Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh is my shepherd; <br>I shall lack nothing. <br>
<sup>2</sup> He makes me lie down in green pastures. <br>He leads me beside still waters. <br>
<sup>3</sup> He restores my soul. <br>He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, <br>I will fear no evil, for you are with me. <br>Your rod and your staff, <br>they comfort me. <br>
<sup>5</sup> You prepare a table before me <br>in the presence of my enemies. <br>You anoint my head with oil. <br>My cup runs over. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, <br>and I will dwell in Yahweh’s house forever.
## Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> The earth is Yahweh’s, with its fullness; <br>the world, and those who dwell in it. <br>
<sup>2</sup> For he has founded it on the seas, <br>and established it on the floods.

<sup>3</sup> Who may ascend to Yahweh’s hill? <br>Who may stand in his holy place? <br>
<sup>4</sup> He who has clean hands and a pure heart; <br>who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood, <br>and has not sworn deceitfully. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh, <br>righteousness from the God of his salvation. <br>
<sup>6</sup> This is the generation of those who seek Him, <br>who seek your face—even Jacob. <br>Selah.

<sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates! <br>Be lifted up, you everlasting doors, <br>and the King of glory will come in. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Who is the King of glory? <br>Yahweh strong and mighty, <br>Yahweh mighty in battle. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates; <br>yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors, <br>and the King of glory will come in. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Who is this King of glory? <br>Yahweh of Armies is the King of glory! <br>Selah.
## Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> To you, Yahweh, I lift up my soul. <br>
<sup>2</sup> My God, I have trusted in you. <br>Don’t let me be shamed. <br>Don’t let my enemies triumph over me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Yes, no one who waits for you will be shamed. <br>They will be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.

<sup>4</sup> Show me your ways, Yahweh. <br>Teach me your paths. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Guide me in your truth, and teach me, <br>for you are the God of my salvation. <br>I wait for you all day long. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness, <br>for they are from old times. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Don’t remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions. <br>Remember me according to your loving kindness, <br>for your goodness’ sake, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Good and upright is Yahweh, <br>therefore he will instruct sinners in the way. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He will guide the humble in justice. <br>He will teach the humble his way. <br>
<sup>10</sup> All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth <br>to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. <br>
<sup>11</sup> For your name’s sake, Yahweh, <br>pardon my iniquity, for it is great. <br>
<sup>12</sup> What man is he who fears Yahweh? <br>He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose. <br>
<sup>13</sup> His soul will dwell at ease. <br>His offspring will inherit the land. <br>
<sup>14</sup> The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him. <br>He will show them his covenant.

<sup>15</sup> My eyes are ever on Yahweh, <br>for he will pluck my feet out of the net. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me, <br>for I am desolate and afflicted. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The troubles of my heart are enlarged. <br>Oh bring me out of my distresses. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Consider my affliction and my travail. <br>Forgive all my sins. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Consider my enemies, for they are many. <br>They hate me with cruel hatred. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Oh keep my soul, and deliver me. <br>Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, <br>for I wait for you. <br>
<sup>22</sup> God, redeem Israel <br>out of all his troubles.
## Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity. <br>I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me. <br>Try my heart and my mind. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For your loving kindness is before my eyes. <br>I have walked in your truth. <br>
<sup>4</sup> I have not sat with deceitful men, <br>neither will I go in with hypocrites. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I hate the assembly of evildoers, <br>and will not sit with the wicked. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I will wash my hands in innocence, <br>so I will go about your altar, Yahweh, <br>
<sup>7</sup> that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard <br>and tell of all your wondrous deeds. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, <br>the place where your glory dwells. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t gather my soul with sinners, <br>nor my life with bloodthirsty men <br>
<sup>10</sup> in whose hands is wickedness; <br>their right hand is full of bribes.

<sup>11</sup> But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. <br>Redeem me, and be merciful to me. <br>
<sup>12</sup> My foot stands in an even place. <br>In the congregations I will bless Yahweh.
## Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh is my light and my salvation. <br>Whom shall I fear? <br>Yahweh is the strength of my life. <br>Of whom shall I be afraid? <br>
<sup>2</sup> When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh, <br>even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Though an army should encamp against me, <br>my heart shall not fear. <br>Though war should rise against me, <br>even then I will be confident. <br>
<sup>4</sup> One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after: <br>that I may dwell in Yahweh’s house all the days of my life, <br>to see Yahweh’s beauty, <br>and to inquire in his temple. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For in the day of trouble, he will keep me secretly in his pavilion. <br>In the secret place of his tabernacle, he will hide me. <br>He will lift me up on a rock. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me. <br>I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent. <br>I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.

<sup>7</sup> Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice. <br>Have mercy also on me, and answer me. <br>
<sup>8</sup> When you said, “Seek my face,” <br>my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, Yahweh.” <br>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t hide your face from me. <br>Don’t put your servant away in anger. <br>You have been my help. <br>Don’t abandon me, <br>neither forsake me, God of my salvation. <br>
<sup>10</sup> When my father and my mother forsake me, <br>then Yahweh will take me up. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Yahweh. <br>Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, <br>for false witnesses have risen up against me, <br>such as breathe out cruelty. <br>
<sup>13</sup> I am still confident of this: <br>I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Wait for Yahweh. <br>Be strong, and let your heart take courage. <br>Yes, wait for Yahweh.
## Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> To you, Yahweh, I call. <br>My rock, don’t be deaf to me, <br>lest, if you are silent to me, <br>I would become like those who go down into the pit. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you, <br>when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Don’t draw me away with the wicked, <br>with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors, <br>but mischief is in their hearts. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings. <br>Give them according to the operation of their hands. <br>Bring back on them what they deserve. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Because they don’t respect the works of Yahweh, <br>nor the operation of his hands, <br>he will break them down and not build them up.

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, <br>because he has heard the voice of my petitions. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Yahweh is my strength and my shield. <br>My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped. <br>Therefore my heart greatly rejoices. <br>With my song I will thank him. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh is their strength. <br>He is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Save your people, <br>and bless your inheritance. <br>Be their shepherd also, <br>and bear them up forever.
## Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the mighty, <br>ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. <br>Worship Yahweh in holy array.

<sup>3</sup> Yahweh’s voice is on the waters. <br>The God of glory thunders, even Yahweh on many waters. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Yahweh’s voice is powerful. <br>Yahweh’s voice is full of majesty. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Yahweh’s voice breaks the cedars. <br>Yes, Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He makes them also to skip like a calf; <br>Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Yahweh’s voice strikes with flashes of lightning. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh’s voice shakes the wilderness. <br>Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Yahweh’s voice makes the deer calve, <br>and strips the forests bare. <br>In his temple everything says, “Glory!”

<sup>10</sup> Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood. <br>Yes, Yahweh sits as King forever. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Yahweh will give strength to his people. <br>Yahweh will bless his people with peace.
## Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up, <br>and have not made my foes to rejoice over me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh my God, I cried to you, <br>and you have healed me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.<sup>a</sup> <br>You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of his. <br>Give thanks to his holy name. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For his anger is but for a moment. <br>His favor is for a lifetime. <br>Weeping may stay for the night, <br>but joy comes in the morning. <br>
<sup>6</sup> As for me, I said in my prosperity, <br>“I shall never be moved.” <br>
<sup>7</sup> You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong; <br>but when you hid your face, I was troubled. <br>
<sup>8</sup> I cried to you, Yahweh. <br>I made supplication to the Lord: <br>
<sup>9</sup> “What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit? <br>Shall the dust praise you? <br>Shall it declare your truth? <br>
<sup>10</sup> Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me. <br>Yahweh, be my helper.” <br>
<sup>11</sup> You have turned my mourning into dancing for me. <br>You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness, <br>
<sup>12</sup> to the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent. <br>Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever!

## Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. <br>Let me never be disappointed. <br>Deliver me in your righteousness. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Bow down your ear to me. <br>Deliver me speedily. <br>Be to me a strong rock, <br>a house of defense to save me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For you are my rock and my fortress, <br>therefore for your name’s sake lead me and guide me. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me, <br>for you are my stronghold. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Into your hand I commend my spirit. <br>You redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I hate those who regard lying vanities, <br>but I trust in Yahweh. <br>
<sup>7</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness, <br>for you have seen my affliction. <br>You have known my soul in adversities. <br>
<sup>8</sup> You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. <br>You have set my feet in a large place. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress. <br>My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For my life is spent with sorrow, <br>my years with sighing. <br>My strength fails because of my iniquity. <br>My bones are wasted away. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors, <br>a horror to my acquaintances. <br>Those who saw me on the street fled from me. <br>
<sup>12</sup> I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man. <br>I am like broken pottery. <br>
<sup>13</sup> For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side, <br>while they conspire together against me, <br>they plot to take away my life. <br>
<sup>14</sup> But I trust in you, Yahweh. <br>I said, “You are my God.” <br>
<sup>15</sup> My times are in your hand. <br>Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Make your face to shine on your servant. <br>Save me in your loving kindness. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Let me not be disappointed, Yahweh, for I have called on you. <br>Let the wicked be disappointed. <br>Let them be silent in Sheol.<sup>a</sup> <br>
<sup>18</sup> Let the lying lips be mute, <br>which speak against the righteous insolently, with pride and contempt. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Oh how great is your goodness, <br>which you have laid up for those who fear you, <br>which you have worked for those who take refuge in you, <br>before the sons of men! <br>
<sup>20</sup> In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man. <br>You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Praise be to Yahweh, <br>for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city. <br>
<sup>22</sup> As for me, I said in my haste, “I am cut off from before your eyes.” <br>Nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Oh love Yahweh, all you his saints! <br>Yahweh preserves the faithful, <br>and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Be strong, and let your heart take courage, <br>all you who hope in Yahweh.

## Chapter 32

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven, <br>whose sin is covered. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn’t impute iniquity, <br>in whose spirit there is no deceit. <br>
<sup>3</sup> When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For day and night your hand was heavy on me. <br>My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin to you. <br>I didn’t hide my iniquity. <br>I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh, <br>and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. <br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found. <br>Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him. <br>
<sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place. <br>You will preserve me from trouble. <br>You will surround me with songs of deliverance. <br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go. <br>I will counsel you with my eye on you. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding, <br>who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Many sorrows come to the wicked, <br>but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous! <br>Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
## Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous! <br>Praise is fitting for the upright. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre. <br>Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Sing to him a new song. <br>Play skillfully with a shout of joy! <br>
<sup>4</sup> For Yahweh’s word is right. <br>All his work is done in faithfulness. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He loves righteousness and justice. <br>The earth is full of the loving kindness of Yahweh. <br>
<sup>6</sup> By Yahweh’s word, the heavens were made: <br>all their army by the breath of his mouth. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap. <br>He lays up the deeps in storehouses. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Let all the earth fear Yahweh. <br>Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For he spoke, and it was done. <br>He commanded, and it stood firm. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing. <br>He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever, <br>the thoughts of his heart to all generations. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, <br>the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Yahweh looks from heaven. <br>He sees all the sons of men. <br>
<sup>14</sup> From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth, <br>
<sup>15</sup> he who fashions all of their hearts; <br>and he considers all of their works. <br>
<sup>16</sup> There is no king saved by the multitude of an army. <br>A mighty man is not delivered by great strength. <br>
<sup>17</sup> A horse is a vain thing for safety, <br>neither does he deliver any by his great power. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Behold, Yahweh’s eye is on those who fear him, <br>on those who hope in his loving kindness, <br>
<sup>19</sup> to deliver their soul from death, <br>to keep them alive in famine. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Our soul has waited for Yahweh. <br>He is our help and our shield. <br>
<sup>21</sup> For our heart rejoices in him, <br>because we have trusted in his holy name. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Let your loving kindness be on us, Yahweh, <br>since we have hoped in you.
## Chapter 34

<sup>1</sup> I will bless Yahweh at all times. <br>His praise will always be in my mouth. <br>
<sup>2</sup> My soul shall boast in Yahweh. <br>The humble shall hear of it and be glad. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Oh magnify Yahweh with me. <br>Let’s exalt his name together. <br>
<sup>4</sup> I sought Yahweh, and he answered me, <br>and delivered me from all my fears. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They looked to him, and were radiant. <br>Their faces shall never be covered with shame. <br>
<sup>6</sup> This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him, <br>and saved him out of all his troubles. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Yahweh’s angel encamps around those who fear him, <br>and delivers them. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good. <br>Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints, <br>for there is no lack with those who fear him. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, <br>but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good thing.

<sup>11</sup> Come, you children, listen to me. <br>I will teach you the fear of Yahweh. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Who is someone who desires life, <br>and loves many days, that he may see good? <br>
<sup>13</sup> Keep your tongue from evil, <br>and your lips from speaking lies. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Depart from evil, and do good. <br>Seek peace, and pursue it. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Yahweh’s eyes are toward the righteous. <br>His ears listen to their cry. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Yahweh’s face is against those who do evil, <br>to cut off their memory from the earth. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears, <br>and delivers them out of all their troubles. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart, <br>and saves those who have a crushed spirit. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Many are the afflictions of the righteous, <br>but Yahweh delivers him out of them all. <br>
<sup>20</sup> He protects all of his bones. <br>Not one of them is broken. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Evil shall kill the wicked. <br>Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants. <br>None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.
## Chapter 35

<sup>1</sup> Contend, Yahweh, with those who contend with me. <br>Fight against those who fight against me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Take hold of shield and buckler, <br>and stand up for my help. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me. <br>Tell my soul, “I am your salvation.” <br>
<sup>4</sup> Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor. <br>Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Let them be as chaff before the wind, <br>Yahweh’s angel driving them on. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Let their way be dark and slippery, <br>Yahweh’s angel pursuing them. <br>
<sup>7</sup> For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me. <br>Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Let destruction come on him unawares. <br>Let his net that he has hidden catch himself. <br>Let him fall into that destruction.

<sup>9</sup> My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh. <br>It shall rejoice in his salvation. <br>
<sup>10</sup> All my bones shall say, “Yahweh, who is like you, <br>who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him; <br>yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?” <br>
<sup>11</sup> Unrighteous witnesses rise up. <br>They ask me about things that I don’t know about. <br>
<sup>12</sup> They reward me evil for good, <br>to the bereaving of my soul.

<sup>13</sup> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. <br>I afflicted my soul with fasting. <br>My prayer returned into my own bosom. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother. <br>I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother. <br>
<sup>15</sup> But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together. <br>The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn’t know it. <br>They tore at me, and didn’t cease. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Like the profane mockers in feasts, <br>they gnashed their teeth at me. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Lord, how long will you look on? <br>Rescue my soul from their destruction, <br>my precious life from the lions. <br>
<sup>18</sup> I will give you thanks in the great assembly. <br>I will praise you among many people. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; <br>neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes. <br>
<sup>20</sup> For they don’t speak peace, <br>but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me. <br>They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!” <br>
<sup>22</sup> You have seen it, Yahweh. Don’t keep silent. <br>Lord, don’t be far from me. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God! <br>My Lord, contend for me! <br>
<sup>24</sup> Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according to your righteousness. <br>Don’t let them gloat over me. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Don’t let them say in their heart, “Aha! That’s the way we want it!” <br>Don’t let them say, “We have swallowed him up!” <br>
<sup>26</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity. <br>Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me.

<sup>27</sup> Let those who favor my righteous cause shout for joy and be glad. <br>Yes, let them say continually, “May Yahweh be magnified, <br>who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!” <br>
<sup>28</sup> My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long.
## Chapter 36

<sup>1</sup> A revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked: <br>There is no fear of God before his eyes. <br>
<sup>2</sup> For he flatters himself in his own eyes, <br>too much to detect and hate his sin. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. <br>He has ceased to be wise and to do good. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He plots iniquity on his bed. <br>He sets himself in a way that is not good. <br>He doesn’t abhor evil.

<sup>5</sup> Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens. <br>Your faithfulness reaches to the skies. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. <br>Your judgments are like a great deep. <br>Yahweh, you preserve man and animal. <br>
<sup>7</sup> How precious is your loving kindness, God! <br>The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house. <br>You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For with you is the spring of life. <br>In your light we will see light. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you, <br>your righteousness to the upright in heart. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t let the foot of pride come against me. <br>Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away. <br>
<sup>12</sup> There the workers of iniquity are fallen. <br>They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
## Chapter 37

<sup>1</sup> Don’t fret because of evildoers, <br>neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness. <br>
<sup>2</sup> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, <br>and wither like the green herb. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Trust in Yahweh, and do good. <br>Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Also delight yourself in Yahweh, <br>and he will give you the desires of your heart. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Commit your way to Yahweh. <br>Trust also in him, and he will do this: <br>
<sup>6</sup> he will make your righteousness shine out like light, <br>and your justice as the noon day sun. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him. <br>Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way, <br>because of the man who makes wicked plots happen. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. <br>Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For evildoers shall be cut off, <br>but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more. <br>Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there. <br>
<sup>11</sup> But the humble shall inherit the land, <br>and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The wicked plots against the just, <br>and gnashes at him with his teeth. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The Lord will laugh at him, <br>for he sees that his day is coming. <br>
<sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, <br>to cast down the poor and needy, <br>to kill those who are upright on the path. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Their sword shall enter into their own heart. <br>Their bows shall be broken. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Better is a little that the righteous has, <br>than the abundance of many wicked. <br>
<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, <br>but Yahweh upholds the righteous. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Yahweh knows the days of the perfect. <br>Their inheritance shall be forever. <br>
<sup>19</sup> They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil. <br>In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

<sup>20</sup> But the wicked shall perish. <br>The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields. <br>They will vanish— <br>vanish like smoke. <br>
<sup>21</sup> The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back, <br>but the righteous give generously. <br>
<sup>22</sup> For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land. <br>Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off. <br>
<sup>23</sup> A man’s steps are established by Yahweh. <br>He delights in his way. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Though he stumble, he shall not fall, <br>for Yahweh holds him up with his hand. <br>
<sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old, <br>yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, <br>nor his children begging for bread. <br>
<sup>26</sup> All day long he deals graciously, and lends. <br>His offspring is blessed. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Depart from evil, and do good. <br>Live securely forever. <br>
<sup>28</sup> For Yahweh loves justice, <br>and doesn’t forsake his saints. <br>They are preserved forever, <br>but the children of the wicked shall be cut off. <br>
<sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the land, <br>and live in it forever.

<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom. <br>His tongue speaks justice. <br>
<sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart. <br>None of his steps shall slide. <br>
<sup>32</sup> The wicked watch the righteous, <br>and seek to kill him. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Yahweh will not leave him in his hand, <br>nor condemn him when he is judged. <br>
<sup>34</sup> Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way, <br>and he will exalt you to inherit the land. <br>When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.

<sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked in great power, <br>spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil. <br>
<sup>36</sup> But he passed away, and behold, he was not. <br>Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found. <br>
<sup>37</sup> Mark the perfect man, and see the upright, <br>for there is a future for the man of peace. <br>
<sup>38</sup> As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. <br>The future of the wicked shall be cut off. <br>
<sup>39</sup> But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh. <br>He is their stronghold in the time of trouble. <br>
<sup>40</sup> Yahweh helps them and rescues them. <br>He rescues them from the wicked and saves them, <br>because they have taken refuge in him.
## Chapter 38

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath, <br>neither chasten me in your hot displeasure. <br>
<sup>2</sup> For your arrows have pierced me, <br>your hand presses hard on me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation, <br>neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For my iniquities have gone over my head. <br>As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. <br>
<sup>5</sup> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt <br>because of my foolishness. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I am in pain and bowed down greatly. <br>I go mourning all day long. <br>
<sup>7</sup> For my waist is filled with burning. <br>There is no soundness in my flesh. <br>
<sup>8</sup> I am faint and severely bruised. <br>I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before you. <br>My groaning is not hidden from you. <br>
<sup>10</sup> My heart throbs. <br>My strength fails me. <br>As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me. <br>
<sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague. <br>My kinsmen stand far away. <br>
<sup>12</sup> They also who seek after my life lay snares. <br>Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, <br>and meditate deceits all day long. <br>
<sup>13</sup> But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear. <br>I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear, <br>in whose mouth are no reproofs. <br>
<sup>15</sup> For I hope in you, Yahweh. <br>You will answer, Lord my God. <br>
<sup>16</sup> For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me, <br>or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.” <br>
<sup>17</sup> For I am ready to fall. <br>My pain is continually before me. <br>
<sup>18</sup> For I will declare my iniquity. <br>I will be sorry for my sin. <br>
<sup>19</sup> But my enemies are vigorous and many. <br>Those who hate me without reason are numerous. <br>
<sup>20</sup> They who render evil for good are also adversaries to me, <br>because I follow what is good. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Don’t forsake me, Yahweh. <br>My God, don’t be far from me. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Hurry to help me, <br>Lord, my salvation.
## Chapter 39

<sup>1</sup> I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue. <br>I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.” <br>
<sup>2</sup> I was mute with silence. <br>I held my peace, even from good. <br>My sorrow was stirred. <br>
<sup>3</sup> My heart was hot within me. <br>While I meditated, the fire burned. <br>I spoke with my tongue: <br>
<sup>4</sup> “Yahweh, show me my end, <br>what is the measure of my days. <br>Let me know how frail I am. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Behold, you have made my days hand widths. <br>My lifetime is as nothing before you. <br>Surely every man stands as a breath.” <br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> “Surely every man walks like a shadow. <br>Surely they busy themselves in vain. <br>He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Now, Lord, what do I wait for? <br>My hope is in you. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Deliver me from all my transgressions. <br>Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish. <br>
<sup>9</sup> I was mute. <br>I didn’t open my mouth, <br>because you did it. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Remove your scourge away from me. <br>I am overcome by the blow of your hand. <br>
<sup>11</sup> When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity, <br>you consume his wealth like a moth. <br>Surely every man is but a breath.” <br>Selah.

<sup>12</sup> “Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry. <br>Don’t be silent at my tears. <br>For I am a stranger with you, <br>a foreigner, as all my fathers were. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, <br>before I go away and exist no more.”
## Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> I waited patiently for Yahweh. <br>He turned to me, and heard my cry. <br>
<sup>2</sup> He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, <br>out of the miry clay. <br>He set my feet on a rock, <br>and gave me a firm place to stand. <br>
<sup>3</sup> He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God. <br>Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust, <br>and doesn’t respect the proud, nor such as turn away to lies. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done, <br>and your thoughts which are toward us. <br>They can’t be declared back to you. <br>If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire. <br>You have opened my ears. <br>You have not required burnt offering and sin offering. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Then I said, “Behold, I have come. <br>It is written about me in the book in the scroll. <br>
<sup>8</sup> I delight to do your will, my God. <br>Yes, your law is within my heart.” <br>
<sup>9</sup> I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly. <br>Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know. <br>
<sup>10</sup> I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart. <br>I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation. <br>I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh. <br>Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me. <br>
<sup>12</sup> For innumerable evils have surrounded me. <br>My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up. <br>They are more than the hairs of my head. <br>My heart has failed me. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me. <br>Hurry to help me, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it. <br>Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!” <br>
<sup>16</sup> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. <br>Let such as love your salvation say continually, “Let Yahweh be exalted!” <br>
<sup>17</sup> But I am poor and needy. <br>May the Lord think about me. <br>You are my help and my deliverer. <br>Don’t delay, my God.
## Chapter 41

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is he who considers the poor. <br>Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive. <br>He shall be blessed on the earth, <br>and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed, <br>and restore him from his bed of illness. <br>
<sup>4</sup> I said, “Yahweh, have mercy on me! <br>Heal me, for I have sinned against you.” <br>
<sup>5</sup> My enemies speak evil against me: <br>“When will he die, and his name perish?” <br>
<sup>6</sup> If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood. <br>His heart gathers iniquity to itself. <br>When he goes abroad, he tells it. <br>
<sup>7</sup> All who hate me whisper together against me. <br>They imagine the worst for me. <br>
<sup>8</sup> “An evil disease”, they say, “has afflicted him. <br>Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.” <br>
<sup>9</sup> Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, <br>who ate bread with me, <br>has lifted up his heel against me.

<sup>10</sup> But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, <br>that I may repay them. <br>
<sup>11</sup> By this I know that you delight in me, <br>because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me. <br>
<sup>12</sup> As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, <br>and set me in your presence forever.

<sup>13</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, <br>from everlasting and to everlasting! <br>Amen and amen.
## Chapter 42

<sup>1</sup> As the deer pants for the water brooks, <br>so my soul pants after you, God.<sup>a</sup> <br>
<sup>2</sup> My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. <br>When shall I come and appear before God? <br>
<sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night, <br>while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?” <br>
<sup>4</sup> These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, <br>how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to God’s house, <br>with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul? <br>Why are you disturbed within me? <br>Hope in God! <br>For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence. <br>
<sup>6</sup> My God, my soul is in despair within me. <br>Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan, <br>the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. <br>All your waves and your billows have swept over me.

<sup>8</sup> Yahweh<sup>b</sup> will command his loving kindness in the daytime. <br>In the night his song shall be with me: <br>a prayer to the God of my life. <br>
<sup>9</sup> I will ask God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? <br>Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?” <br>
<sup>10</sup> As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, <br>while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?” <br>
<sup>11</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul? <br>Why are you disturbed within me? <br>Hope in God! For I shall still praise him, <br>the saving help of my countenance, and my God.

> - <sup>a</sup> 1. The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “[hebrew]אֱלֹהִ֑ים[/hebrew]” (Elohim).
> - <sup>b</sup> 8. “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.

## Chapter 43

<sup>1</sup> Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. <br>Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men. <br>
<sup>2</sup> For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me? <br>Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? <br>
<sup>3</sup> Oh, send out your light and your truth. <br>Let them lead me. <br>Let them bring me to your holy hill, <br>to your tents. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Then I will go to the altar of God, <br>to God, my exceeding joy. <br>I will praise you on the harp, God, my God. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul? <br>Why are you disturbed within me? <br>Hope in God! <br>For I shall still praise him: <br>my Savior, my helper, and my God.
## Chapter 44

<sup>1</sup> We have heard with our ears, God; <br>our fathers have told us what work you did in their days, <br>in the days of old. <br>
<sup>2</sup> You drove out the nations with your hand, <br>but you planted them. <br>You afflicted the peoples, <br>but you spread them abroad. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword, <br>neither did their own arm save them; <br>but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, <br>because you were favorable to them. <br>
<sup>4</sup> God, you are my King. <br>Command victories for Jacob! <br>
<sup>5</sup> Through you, we will push down our adversaries. <br>Through your name, we will tread down those who rise up against us. <br>
<sup>6</sup> For I will not trust in my bow, <br>neither will my sword save me. <br>
<sup>7</sup> But you have saved us from our adversaries, <br>and have shamed those who hate us. <br>
<sup>8</sup> In God we have made our boast all day long. <br>We will give thanks to your name forever. <br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, <br>and don’t go out with our armies. <br>
<sup>10</sup> You make us turn back from the adversary. <br>Those who hate us take plunder for themselves. <br>
<sup>11</sup> You have made us like sheep for food, <br>and have scattered us among the nations. <br>
<sup>12</sup> You sell your people for nothing, <br>and have gained nothing from their sale. <br>
<sup>13</sup> You make us a reproach to our neighbors, <br>a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us. <br>
<sup>14</sup> You make us a byword among the nations, <br>a shaking of the head among the peoples. <br>
<sup>15</sup> All day long my dishonor is before me, <br>and shame covers my face, <br>
<sup>16</sup> at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, <br>because of the enemy and the avenger. <br>
<sup>17</sup> All this has come on us, <br>yet we haven’t forgotten you. <br>We haven’t been false to your covenant. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Our heart has not turned back, <br>neither have our steps strayed from your path, <br>
<sup>19</sup> though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, <br>and covered us with the shadow of death. <br>
<sup>20</sup> If we have forgotten the name of our God, <br>or spread out our hands to a strange god, <br>
<sup>21</sup> won’t God search this out? <br>For he knows the secrets of the heart. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. <br>We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Wake up! <br>Why do you sleep, Lord?<sup>a</sup> <br>Arise! <br>Don’t reject us forever. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Why do you hide your face, <br>and forget our affliction and our oppression? <br>
<sup>25</sup> For our soul is bowed down to the dust. <br>Our body clings to the earth. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Rise up to help us. <br>Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.

> - <sup>a</sup> 23. The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”

## Chapter 45

<sup>1</sup> My heart overflows with a noble theme. <br>I recite my verses for the king. <br>My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer. <br>
<sup>2</sup> You are the most excellent of the sons of men. <br>Grace has anointed your lips, <br>therefore God has blessed you forever. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Strap your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, <br>in your splendor and your majesty. <br>
<sup>4</sup> In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness. <br>Let your right hand display awesome deeds. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Your arrows are sharp. <br>The nations fall under you, with arrows in the heart of the king’s enemies. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Your throne, God, is forever and ever. <br>A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom. <br>
<sup>7</sup> You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. <br>Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows. <br>
<sup>8</sup> All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia. <br>Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women. <br>At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear. <br>Forget your own people, and also your father’s house. <br>
<sup>11</sup> So the king will desire your beauty, <br>honor him, for he is your lord. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift. <br>The rich among the people entreat your favor. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The princess inside is all glorious. <br>Her clothing is interwoven with gold. <br>
<sup>14</sup> She shall be led to the king in embroidered work. <br>The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you. <br>
<sup>15</sup> With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led. <br>They shall enter into the king’s palace. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Your sons will take the place of your fathers. <br>You shall make them princes in all the earth. <br>
<sup>17</sup> I will make your name to be remembered in all generations. <br>Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.
## Chapter 46

<sup>1</sup> God is our refuge and strength, <br>a very present help in trouble. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes, <br>though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas; <br>
<sup>3</sup> though its waters roar and are troubled, <br>though the mountains tremble with their swelling. <br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad, <br>the holy place of the tents of the Most High. <br>
<sup>5</sup> God is within her. She shall not be moved. <br>God will help her at dawn. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved. <br>He lifted his voice and the earth melted. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Yahweh of Armies is with us. <br>The God of Jacob is our refuge. <br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Come, see Yahweh’s works, <br>what desolations he has made in the earth. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He makes wars cease to the end of the earth. <br>He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear. <br>He burns the chariots in the fire. <br>
<sup>10</sup> “Be still, and know that I am God. <br>I will be exalted among the nations. <br>I will be exalted in the earth.” <br>
<sup>11</sup> Yahweh of Armies is with us. <br>The God of Jacob is our refuge. <br>Selah.
## Chapter 47

<sup>1</sup> Oh clap your hands, all you nations. <br>Shout to God with the voice of triumph! <br>
<sup>2</sup> For Yahweh Most High is awesome. <br>He is a great King over all the earth. <br>
<sup>3</sup> He subdues nations under us, <br>and peoples under our feet. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He chooses our inheritance for us, <br>the glory of Jacob whom he loved. <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> God has gone up with a shout, <br>Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Sing praises to God! Sing praises! <br>Sing praises to our King! Sing praises! <br>
<sup>7</sup> For God is the King of all the earth. <br>Sing praises with understanding. <br>
<sup>8</sup> God reigns over the nations. <br>God sits on his holy throne. <br>
<sup>9</sup> The princes of the peoples are gathered together, <br>the people of the God of Abraham. <br>For the shields of the earth belong to God. <br>He is greatly exalted!
## Chapter 48

<sup>1</sup> Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised, <br>in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, <br>is Mount Zion, on the north sides, <br>the city of the great King. <br>
<sup>3</sup> God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For, behold, the kings assembled themselves, <br>they passed by together. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They saw it, then they were amazed. <br>They were dismayed. <br>They hurried away. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Trembling took hold of them there, <br>pain, as of a woman in travail. <br>
<sup>7</sup> With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish. <br>
<sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so we have seen, <br>in the city of Yahweh of Armies, in the city of our God. <br>God will establish it forever. <br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> We have thought about your loving kindness, God, <br>in the middle of your temple. <br>
<sup>10</sup> As is your name, God, <br>so is your praise to the ends of the earth. <br>Your right hand is full of righteousness. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Let Mount Zion be glad! <br>Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Walk about Zion, and go around her. <br>Number its towers. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Notice her bulwarks. <br>Consider her palaces, <br>that you may tell it to the next generation. <br>
<sup>14</sup> For this God is our God forever and ever. <br>He will be our guide even to death.
## Chapter 49

<sup>1</sup> Hear this, all you peoples. <br>Listen, all you inhabitants of the world, <br>
<sup>2</sup> both low and high, <br>rich and poor together. <br>
<sup>3</sup> My mouth will speak words of wisdom. <br>My heart will utter understanding. <br>
<sup>4</sup> I will incline my ear to a proverb. <br>I will solve my riddle on the harp. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Why should I fear in the days of evil, <br>when iniquity at my heels surrounds me? <br>
<sup>6</sup> Those who trust in their wealth, <br>and boast in the multitude of their riches— <br>
<sup>7</sup> none of them can by any means redeem his brother, <br>nor give God a ransom for him. <br>
<sup>8</sup> For the redemption of their life is costly, <br>no payment is ever enough, <br>
<sup>9</sup> that he should live on forever, <br>that he should not see corruption. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For he sees that wise men die; <br>likewise the fool and the senseless perish, <br>and leave their wealth to others. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever, <br>and their dwelling places to all generations. <br>They name their lands after themselves. <br>
<sup>12</sup> But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure. <br>He is like the animals that perish.

<sup>13</sup> This is the destiny of those who are foolish, <br>and of those who approve their sayings. <br>Selah.

<sup>14</sup> They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.<sup>a</sup> <br>Death shall be their shepherd. <br>The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. <br>Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,<sup>b</sup> <br>far from their mansion. <br>
<sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,<sup>c</sup> <br>for he will receive me. <br>Selah.

<sup>16</sup> Don’t be afraid when a man is made rich, <br>when the glory of his house is increased; <br>
<sup>17</sup> for when he dies he will carry nothing away. <br>His glory won’t descend after him. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul— <br>and men praise you when you do well for yourself— <br>
<sup>19</sup> he shall go to the generation of his fathers. <br>They shall never see the light. <br>
<sup>20</sup> A man who has riches without understanding, <br>is like the animals that perish.

> - <sup>a</sup> 14. Sheol is the place of the dead.
> - <sup>b</sup> 14. Sheol is the place of the dead.
> - <sup>c</sup> 15. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 50

<sup>1</sup> The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks, <br>and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, <br>God shines out. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Our God comes, and does not keep silent. <br>A fire devours before him. <br>It is very stormy around him. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He calls to the heavens above, <br>to the earth, that he may judge his people: <br>
<sup>5</sup> “Gather my saints together to me, <br>those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” <br>
<sup>6</sup> The heavens shall declare his righteousness, <br>for God himself is judge. <br>Selah.

<sup>7</sup> “Hear, my people, and I will speak. <br>Israel, I will testify against you. <br>I am God, your God. <br>
<sup>8</sup> I don’t rebuke you for your sacrifices. <br>Your burnt offerings are continually before me. <br>
<sup>9</sup> I have no need for a bull from your stall, <br>nor male goats from your pens. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For every animal of the forest is mine, <br>and the livestock on a thousand hills. <br>
<sup>11</sup> I know all the birds of the mountains. <br>The wild animals of the field are mine. <br>
<sup>12</sup> If I were hungry, I would not tell you, <br>for the world is mine, and all that is in it. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Will I eat the meat of bulls, <br>or drink the blood of goats? <br>
<sup>14</sup> Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving. <br>Pay your vows to the Most High. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Call on me in the day of trouble. <br>I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”

<sup>16</sup> But to the wicked God says, <br>“What right do you have to declare my statutes, <br>that you have taken my covenant on your lips, <br>
<sup>17</sup> since you hate instruction, <br>and throw my words behind you? <br>
<sup>18</sup> When you saw a thief, you consented with him, <br>and have participated with adulterers.

<sup>19</sup> “You give your mouth to evil. <br>Your tongue frames deceit. <br>
<sup>20</sup> You sit and speak against your brother. <br>You slander your own mother’s son. <br>
<sup>21</sup> You have done these things, and I kept silent. <br>You thought that I was just like you. <br>I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.

<sup>22</sup> “Now consider this, you who forget God, <br>lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me, <br>and prepares his way so that I will show God’s salvation to him.”
## Chapter 51

<sup>1</sup> Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness. <br>According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. <br>Cleanse me from my sin. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For I know my transgressions. <br>My sin is constantly before me. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Against you, and you only, I have sinned, <br>and done that which is evil in your sight, <br>so you may be proved right when you speak, <br>and justified when you judge. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Behold, I was born in iniquity. <br>My mother conceived me in sin. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts. <br>You teach me wisdom in the inmost place. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean. <br>Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Let me hear joy and gladness, <br>that the bones which you have broken may rejoice. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Hide your face from my sins, <br>and blot out all of my iniquities. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Create in me a clean heart, O God. <br>Renew a right spirit within me. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t throw me from your presence, <br>and don’t take your Holy Spirit from me. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Restore to me the joy of your salvation. <br>Uphold me with a willing spirit. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Then I will teach transgressors your ways. <br>Sinners will be converted to you. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation. <br>My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Lord, open my lips. <br>My mouth will declare your praise. <br>
<sup>16</sup> For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it. <br>You have no pleasure in burnt offering. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. <br>O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart.

<sup>18</sup> Do well in your good pleasure to Zion. <br>Build the walls of Jerusalem. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, <br>in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. <br>Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
## Chapter 52

<sup>1</sup> Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man? <br>God’s loving kindness endures continually. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Your tongue plots destruction, <br>like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. <br>
<sup>3</sup> You love evil more than good, <br>lying rather than speaking the truth. <br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> You love all devouring words, <br>you deceitful tongue. <br>
<sup>5</sup> God will likewise destroy you forever. <br>He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, <br>and root you out of the land of the living. <br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> The righteous also will see it, and fear, <br>and laugh at him, saying, <br>
<sup>7</sup> “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his strength, <br>but trusted in the abundance of his riches, <br>and strengthened himself in his wickedness.” <br>
<sup>8</sup> But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house. <br>I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever. <br>
<sup>9</sup> I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it. <br>I will hope in your name, for it is good, <br>in the presence of your saints.
## Chapter 53

<sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” <br>They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity. <br>There is no one who does good. <br>
<sup>2</sup> God looks down from heaven on the children of men, <br>to see if there are any who understood, <br>who seek after God. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Every one of them has gone back. <br>They have become filthy together. <br>There is no one who does good, no, not one. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, <br>who eat up my people as they eat bread, <br>and don’t call on God? <br>
<sup>5</sup> There they were in great fear, where no fear was, <br>for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you. <br>You have put them to shame, <br>because God has rejected them. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! <br>When God brings back his people from captivity, <br>then Jacob shall rejoice, <br>and Israel shall be glad.
## Chapter 54

<sup>1</sup> Save me, God, by your name. <br>Vindicate me in your might. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, God. <br>Listen to the words of my mouth. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For strangers have risen up against me. <br>Violent men have sought after my soul. <br>They haven’t set God before them. <br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> Behold, God is my helper. <br>The Lord is the one who sustains my soul. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He will repay the evil to my enemies. <br>Destroy them in your truth. <br>
<sup>6</sup> With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you. <br>I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good. <br>
<sup>7</sup> For he has delivered me out of all trouble. <br>My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.
## Chapter 55

<sup>1</sup> Listen to my prayer, God. <br>Don’t hide yourself from my supplication. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Attend to me, and answer me. <br>I am restless in my complaint, <br>and moan
<sup>3</sup> because of the voice of the enemy, <br>because of the oppression of the wicked. <br>For they bring suffering on me. <br>In anger they hold a grudge against me. <br>
<sup>4</sup> My heart is severely pained within me. <br>The terrors of death have fallen on me. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling have come on me. <br>Horror has overwhelmed me. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove! <br>Then I would fly away, and be at rest. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Behold, then I would wander far off. <br>I would lodge in the wilderness.” <br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> “I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.” <br>
<sup>9</sup> Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language, <br>for I have seen violence and strife in the city. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Day and night they prowl around on its walls. <br>Malice and abuse are also within her. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Destructive forces are within her. <br>Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets. <br>
<sup>12</sup> For it was not an enemy who insulted me, <br>then I could have endured it. <br>Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me, <br>then I would have hidden myself from him. <br>
<sup>13</sup> But it was you, a man like me, <br>my companion, and my familiar friend. <br>
<sup>14</sup> We took sweet fellowship together. <br>We walked in God’s house with company. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Let death come suddenly on them. <br>Let them go down alive into Sheol.<sup>a</sup> <br>For wickedness is among them, in their dwelling. <br>
<sup>16</sup> As for me, I will call on God. <br>Yahweh will save me. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress. <br>He will hear my voice. <br>
<sup>18</sup> He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, <br>although there are many who oppose me. <br>
<sup>19</sup> God, who is enthroned forever, <br>will hear and answer them. <br>Selah. They never change <br>and don’t fear God. <br>

<sup>20</sup> He raises his hands against his friends. <br>He has violated his covenant. <br>
<sup>21</sup> His mouth was smooth as butter, <br>but his heart was war. <br>His words were softer than oil, <br>yet they were drawn swords.

<sup>22</sup> Cast your burden on Yahweh and he will sustain you. <br>He will never allow the righteous to be moved. <br>
<sup>23</sup> But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. <br>Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, <br>but I will trust in you.

> - <sup>a</sup> 15. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 56

<sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up. <br>All day long, he attacks and oppresses me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> My enemies want to swallow me up all day long, <br>for they are many who fight proudly against me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> When I am afraid, <br>I will put my trust in you. <br>
<sup>4</sup> In God, I praise his word. <br>In God, I put my trust. <br>I will not be afraid. <br>What can flesh do to me? <br>
<sup>5</sup> All day long they twist my words. <br>All their thoughts are against me for evil. <br>
<sup>6</sup> They conspire and lurk, <br>watching my steps. <br>They are eager to take my life. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Shall they escape by iniquity? <br>In anger cast down the peoples, God. <br>
<sup>8</sup> You count my wanderings. <br>You put my tears into your container. <br>Aren’t they in your book? <br>
<sup>9</sup> Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call. <br>I know this: that God is for me. <br>
<sup>10</sup> In God, I will praise his word. <br>In Yahweh, I will praise his word. <br>
<sup>11</sup> I have put my trust in God. <br>I will not be afraid. <br>What can man do to me? <br>
<sup>12</sup> Your vows are on me, God. <br>I will give thank offerings to you. <br>
<sup>13</sup> For you have delivered my soul from death, <br>and prevented my feet from falling, <br>that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
## Chapter 57

<sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, <br>for my soul takes refuge in you. <br>Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge, <br>until disaster has passed. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I cry out to God Most High, <br>to God who accomplishes my requests for me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> He will send from heaven, and save me, <br>he rebukes the one who is pursuing me. <br>Selah. <br>God will send out his loving kindness and his truth. <br>

<sup>4</sup> My soul is among lions. <br>I lie among those who are set on fire, <br>even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, <br>and their tongue a sharp sword. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens! <br>Let your glory be above all the earth!

<sup>6</sup> They have prepared a net for my steps. <br>My soul is bowed down. <br>They dig a pit before me. <br>They fall into the middle of it themselves. <br>Selah.

<sup>7</sup> My heart is steadfast, God. <br>My heart is steadfast. <br>I will sing, yes, I will sing praises. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Wake up, my glory! Wake up, lute and harp! <br>I will wake up the dawn. <br>
<sup>9</sup> I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples. <br>I will sing praises to you among the nations. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens, <br>and your truth to the skies. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens. <br>Let your glory be over all the earth.
## Chapter 58

<sup>1</sup> Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones? <br>Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men? <br>
<sup>2</sup> No, in your heart you plot injustice. <br>You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The wicked go astray from the womb. <br>They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a snake, <br>like a deaf cobra that stops its ear, <br>
<sup>5</sup> which doesn’t listen to the voice of charmers, <br>no matter how skillful the charmer may be. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Break their teeth, God, in their mouth. <br>Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Let them vanish like water that flows away. <br>When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away, <br>like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, <br>he will sweep away the green and the burning alike. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance. <br>He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked, <br>
<sup>11</sup> so that men shall say, “Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous. <br>Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth.”
## Chapter 59

<sup>1</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, my God. <br>Set me on high from those who rise up against me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity. <br>Save me from the bloodthirsty men. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul. <br>The mighty gather themselves together against me, <br>not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>4</sup> I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. <br>Rise up, behold, and help me! <br>
<sup>5</sup> You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of Israel, <br>rouse yourself to punish the nations. <br>Show no mercy to the wicked traitors. <br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> They return at evening, howling like dogs, <br>and prowl around the city. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Behold, they spew with their mouth. <br>Swords are in their lips, <br>“For”, they say, “who hears us?” <br>
<sup>8</sup> But you, Yahweh, laugh at them. <br>You scoff at all the nations. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Oh, my Strength, I watch for you, <br>for God is my high tower. <br>
<sup>10</sup> My God will go before me with his loving kindness. <br>God will let me look at my enemies in triumph. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Don’t kill them, or my people may forget. <br>Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield. <br>
<sup>12</sup> For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, <br>let them be caught in their pride, <br>for the curses and lies which they utter. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Consume them in wrath. <br>Consume them, and they will be no more. <br>Let them know that God rules in Jacob, <br>to the ends of the earth. <br>Selah.

<sup>14</sup> At evening let them return. <br>Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city. <br>
<sup>15</sup> They shall wander up and down for food, <br>and wait all night if they aren’t satisfied.

<sup>16</sup> But I will sing of your strength. <br>Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning. <br>For you have been my high tower, <br>a refuge in the day of my distress. <br>
<sup>17</sup> To you, my strength, I will sing praises. <br>For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
## Chapter 60

<sup>1</sup> God, you have rejected us. <br>You have broken us down. <br>You have been angry. <br>Restore us, again. <br>
<sup>2</sup> You have made the land tremble. <br>You have torn it. <br>Mend its fractures, <br>for it quakes. <br>
<sup>3</sup> You have shown your people hard things. <br>You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger. <br>
<sup>4</sup> You have given a banner to those who fear you, <br>that it may be displayed because of the truth. <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> So that your beloved may be delivered, <br>save with your right hand, and answer us. <br>
<sup>6</sup> God has spoken from his sanctuary: <br>“I will triumph. <br>I will divide Shechem, <br>and measure out the valley of Succoth. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. <br>Ephraim also is the defense of my head. <br>Judah is my scepter. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Moab is my wash basin. <br>I will throw my sandal on Edom. <br>I shout in triumph over Philistia.”

<sup>9</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city? <br>Who has led me to Edom? <br>
<sup>10</sup> Haven’t you, God, rejected us? <br>You don’t go out with our armies, God. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Give us help against the adversary, <br>for the help of man is vain. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Through God we will do valiantly, <br>for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.
## Chapter 61

<sup>1</sup> Hear my cry, God. <br>Listen to my prayer. <br>
<sup>2</sup> From the end of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed. <br>Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For you have been a refuge for me, <br>a strong tower from the enemy. <br>
<sup>4</sup> I will dwell in your tent forever. <br>I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> For you, God, have heard my vows. <br>You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. <br>
<sup>6</sup> You will prolong the king’s life. <br>His years will be for generations. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever. <br>Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him. <br>
<sup>8</sup> So I will sing praise to your name forever, <br>that I may fulfill my vows daily.
## Chapter 62

<sup>1</sup> My soul rests in God alone. <br>My salvation is from him. <br>
<sup>2</sup> He alone is my rock, my salvation, and my fortress. <br>I will never be greatly shaken. <br>
<sup>3</sup> How long will you assault a man? <br>Would all of you throw him down, <br>like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence? <br>
<sup>4</sup> They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place. <br>They delight in lies. <br>They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> My soul, wait in silence for God alone, <br>for my expectation is from him. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress. <br>I will not be shaken. <br>
<sup>7</sup> My salvation and my honor is with God. <br>The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times, you people. <br>Pour out your heart before him. <br>God is a refuge for us. <br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Surely men of low degree are just a breath, <br>and men of high degree are a lie. <br>In the balances they will go up. <br>They are together lighter than a breath. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Don’t trust in oppression. <br>Don’t become vain in robbery. <br>If riches increase, <br>don’t set your heart on them. <br>
<sup>11</sup> God has spoken once; <br>twice I have heard this, <br>that power belongs to God. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness, <br>for you reward every man according to his work.
## Chapter 63

<sup>1</sup> God, you are my God. <br>I will earnestly seek you. <br>My soul thirsts for you. <br>My flesh longs for you, <br>in a dry and weary land, where there is no water. <br>
<sup>2</sup> So I have seen you in the sanctuary, <br>watching your power and your glory. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Because your loving kindness is better than life, <br>my lips shall praise you. <br>
<sup>4</sup> So I will bless you while I live. <br>I will lift up my hands in your name. <br>
<sup>5</sup> My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. <br>My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips, <br>
<sup>6</sup> when I remember you on my bed, <br>and think about you in the night watches. <br>
<sup>7</sup> For you have been my help. <br>I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings. <br>
<sup>8</sup> My soul stays close to you. <br>Your right hand holds me up. <br>
<sup>9</sup> But those who seek my soul to destroy it <br>shall go into the lower parts of the earth. <br>
<sup>10</sup> They shall be given over to the power of the sword. <br>They shall be jackal food. <br>
<sup>11</sup> But the king shall rejoice in God. <br>Everyone who swears by him will praise him, <br>for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.
## Chapter 64

<sup>1</sup> Hear my voice, God, in my complaint. <br>Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, <br>from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil; <br>
<sup>3</sup> who sharpen their tongue like a sword, <br>and aim their arrows, deadly words, <br>
<sup>4</sup> to shoot innocent men from ambushes. <br>They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They encourage themselves in evil plans. <br>They talk about laying snares secretly. <br>They say, “Who will see them?” <br>
<sup>6</sup> They plot injustice, saying, “We have made a perfect plan!” <br>Surely man’s mind and heart are cunning. <br>
<sup>7</sup> But God will shoot at them. <br>They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Their own tongues shall ruin them. <br>All who see them will shake their heads. <br>
<sup>9</sup> All mankind shall be afraid. <br>They shall declare the work of God, <br>and shall wisely ponder what he has done. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh, <br>and shall take refuge in him. <br>All the upright in heart shall praise him!
## Chapter 65

<sup>1</sup> Praise waits for you, God, in Zion. <br>Vows shall be performed to you. <br>
<sup>2</sup> You who hear prayer, <br>all men will come to you. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Sins overwhelmed me, <br>but you atoned for our transgressions. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Blessed is the one whom you choose and cause to come near, <br>that he may live in your courts. <br>We will be filled with the goodness of your house, <br>your holy temple. <br>
<sup>5</sup> By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us, <br>God of our salvation. <br>You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth, <br>of those who are far away on the sea. <br>
<sup>6</sup> By your power, you form the mountains, <br>having armed yourself with strength. <br>
<sup>7</sup> You still the roaring of the seas, <br>the roaring of their waves, <br>and the turmoil of the nations. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They also who dwell in faraway places are afraid at your wonders. <br>You call the morning’s dawn and the evening with songs of joy. <br>
<sup>9</sup> You visit the earth, and water it. <br>You greatly enrich it. <br>The river of God is full of water. <br>You provide them grain, for so you have ordained it. <br>
<sup>10</sup> You drench its furrows. <br>You level its ridges. <br>You soften it with showers. <br>You bless it with a crop. <br>
<sup>11</sup> You crown the year with your bounty. <br>Your carts overflow with abundance. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The wilderness grasslands overflow. <br>The hills are clothed with gladness. <br>
<sup>13</sup> The pastures are covered with flocks. <br>The valleys also are clothed with grain. <br>They shout for joy! <br>They also sing.
## Chapter 66

<sup>1</sup> Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth! <br>
<sup>2</sup> Sing to the glory of his name! <br>Offer glory and praise! <br>
<sup>3</sup> Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds! <br>Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you. <br>
<sup>4</sup> All the earth will worship you, <br>and will sing to you; <br>they will sing to your name.” <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Come, and see God’s deeds— <br>awesome work on behalf of the children of men. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land. <br>They went through the river on foot. <br>There, we rejoiced in him. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He rules by his might forever. <br>His eyes watch the nations. <br>Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him. <br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Praise our God, you peoples! <br>Make the sound of his praise heard, <br>
<sup>9</sup> who preserves our life among the living, <br>and doesn’t allow our feet to be moved. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For you, God, have tested us. <br>You have refined us, as silver is refined. <br>
<sup>11</sup> You brought us into prison. <br>You laid a burden on our backs. <br>
<sup>12</sup> You allowed men to ride over our heads. <br>We went through fire and through water, <br>but you brought us to the place of abundance. <br>
<sup>13</sup> I will come into your temple with burnt offerings. <br>I will pay my vows to you,
<sup>14</sup> which my lips promised, <br>and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress. <br>
<sup>15</sup> I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals, <br>with the offering of rams, <br>I will offer bulls with goats. <br>Selah.

<sup>16</sup> Come and hear, all you who fear God. <br>I will declare what he has done for my soul. <br>
<sup>17</sup> I cried to him with my mouth. <br>He was extolled with my tongue. <br>
<sup>18</sup> If I cherished sin in my heart, <br>the Lord wouldn’t have listened. <br>
<sup>19</sup> But most certainly, God has listened. <br>He has heard the voice of my prayer. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, <br>nor his loving kindness from me.
## Chapter 67

<sup>1</sup> May God be merciful to us, bless us, <br>and cause his face to shine on us. <br>Selah.

<sup>2</sup> That your way may be known on earth, <br>and your salvation among all nations, <br>
<sup>3</sup> let the peoples praise you, God. <br>Let all the peoples praise you. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy, <br>for you will judge the peoples with equity, <br>and govern the nations on earth. <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Let the peoples praise you, God. <br>Let all the peoples praise you. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The earth has yielded its increase. <br>God, even our own God, will bless us. <br>
<sup>7</sup> God will bless us. <br>All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
## Chapter 68

<sup>1</sup> Let God arise! <br>Let his enemies be scattered! <br>Let them who hate him also flee before him. <br>
<sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away, <br>so drive them away. <br>As wax melts before the fire, <br>so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. <br>
<sup>3</sup> But let the righteous be glad. <br>Let them rejoice before God. <br>Yes, let them rejoice with gladness. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Sing to God! Sing praises to his name! <br>Extol him who rides on the clouds: <br>to Yah, his name! <br>Rejoice before him! <br>
<sup>5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows, <br>is God in his holy habitation. <br>
<sup>6</sup> God sets the lonely in families. <br>He brings out the prisoners with singing, <br>but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.

<sup>7</sup> God, when you went out before your people, <br>when you marched through the wilderness... <br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> The earth trembled. <br>The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai— <br>at the presence of God, the God of Israel. <br>
<sup>9</sup> You, God, sent a plentiful rain. <br>You confirmed your inheritance when it was weary. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Your congregation lived therein. <br>You, God, prepared your goodness for the poor. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The Lord announced the word. <br>The ones who proclaim it are a great company. <br>
<sup>12</sup> “Kings of armies flee! They flee!” <br>She who waits at home divides the plunder, <br>
<sup>13</sup> while you sleep among the camp fires, <br>the wings of a dove sheathed with silver, <br>her feathers with shining gold. <br>
<sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings in her, <br>it snowed on Zalmon. <br>
<sup>15</sup> The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains. <br>The mountains of Bashan are rugged. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains, <br>at the mountain where God chooses to reign? <br>Yes, Yahweh will dwell there forever. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands. <br>The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary. <br>
<sup>18</sup> You have ascended on high. <br>You have led away captives. <br>You have received gifts among people, <br>yes, among the rebellious also, that Yah God might dwell there.

<sup>19</sup> Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens, <br>even the God who is our salvation. <br>Selah.

<sup>20</sup> God is to us a God of deliverance. <br>To Yahweh, the Lord, belongs escape from death. <br>
<sup>21</sup> But God will strike through the head of his enemies, <br>the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness. <br>
<sup>22</sup> The Lord said, “I will bring you again from Bashan, <br>I will bring you again from the depths of the sea, <br>
<sup>23</sup> that you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood, <br>that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies.” <br>
<sup>24</sup> They have seen your processions, God, <br>even the processions of my God, my King, into the sanctuary. <br>
<sup>25</sup> The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, <br>among the ladies playing with tambourines, <br>
<sup>26</sup> “Bless God in the congregations, <br>even the Lord in the assembly of Israel!” <br>
<sup>27</sup> There is little Benjamin, their ruler, <br>the princes of Judah, their council, <br>the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.

<sup>28</sup> Your God has commanded your strength. <br>Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Because of your temple at Jerusalem, <br>kings shall bring presents to you. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds, <br>the multitude of the bulls with the calves of the peoples. <br>Trample under foot the bars of silver. <br>Scatter the nations who delight in war. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Princes shall come out of Egypt. <br>Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God. <br>
<sup>32</sup> Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth! <br>Sing praises to the Lord— <br>Selah—

<sup>33</sup> to him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old; <br>behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice. <br>
<sup>34</sup> Ascribe strength to God! <br>His excellency is over Israel, <br>his strength is in the skies. <br>
<sup>35</sup> You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries. <br>The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people. <br>Praise be to God!
## Chapter 69

<sup>1</sup> Save me, God, <br>for the waters have come up to my neck! <br>
<sup>2</sup> I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold. <br>I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> I am weary with my crying. <br>My throat is dry. <br>My eyes fail looking for my God. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. <br>Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. <br>I have to restore what I didn’t take away. <br>
<sup>5</sup> God, you know my foolishness. <br>My sins aren’t hidden from you. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord Yahweh of Armies. <br>Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Because for your sake, I have borne reproach. <br>Shame has covered my face. <br>
<sup>8</sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers, <br>an alien to my mother’s children. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For the zeal of your house consumes me. <br>The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me. <br>
<sup>10</sup> When I wept and I fasted, <br>that was to my reproach. <br>
<sup>11</sup> When I made sackcloth my clothing, <br>I became a byword to them. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Those who sit in the gate talk about me. <br>I am the song of the drunkards. <br>
<sup>13</sup> But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time. <br>God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink. <br>Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me, <br>neither let the deep swallow me up. <br>Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good. <br>According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Don’t hide your face from your servant, <br>for I am in distress. <br>Answer me speedily! <br>
<sup>18</sup> Draw near to my soul and redeem it. <br>Ransom me because of my enemies. <br>
<sup>19</sup> You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor. <br>My adversaries are all before you. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. <br>I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; <br>for comforters, but I found none. <br>
<sup>21</sup> They also gave me poison for my food. <br>In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Let their table before them become a snare. <br>May it become a retribution and a trap. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see. <br>Let their backs be continually bent. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Pour out your indignation on them. <br>Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Let their habitation be desolate. <br>Let no one dwell in their tents. <br>
<sup>26</sup> For they persecute him whom you have wounded. <br>They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Charge them with crime upon crime. <br>Don’t let them come into your righteousness. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Let them be blotted out of the book of life, <br>and not be written with the righteous. <br>
<sup>29</sup> But I am in pain and distress. <br>Let your salvation, God, protect me. <br>
<sup>30</sup> I will praise the name of God with a song, <br>and will magnify him with thanksgiving. <br>
<sup>31</sup> It will please Yahweh better than an ox, <br>or a bull that has horns and hoofs. <br>
<sup>32</sup> The humble have seen it, and are glad. <br>You who seek after God, let your heart live. <br>
<sup>33</sup> For Yahweh hears the needy, <br>and doesn’t despise his captive people. <br>
<sup>34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise him; <br>the seas, and everything that moves therein! <br>
<sup>35</sup> For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. <br>They shall settle there, and own it. <br>
<sup>36</sup> The children also of his servants shall inherit it. <br>Those who love his name shall dwell therein.
## Chapter 70

<sup>1</sup> Hurry, God, to deliver me. <br>Come quickly to help me, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. <br>Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Let them be turned because of their shame <br>who say, “Aha! Aha!” <br>
<sup>4</sup> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. <br>Let those who love your salvation continually say, <br>“Let God be exalted!” <br>
<sup>5</sup> But I am poor and needy. <br>Come to me quickly, God. <br>You are my help and my deliverer. <br>Yahweh, don’t delay.
## Chapter 71

<sup>1</sup> In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. <br>Never let me be disappointed. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me. <br>Turn your ear to me, and save me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go. <br>Give the command to save me, <br>for you are my rock and my fortress. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, <br>from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh, <br>my confidence from my youth. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I have relied on you from the womb. <br>You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb. <br>I will always praise you. <br>
<sup>7</sup> I am a marvel to many, <br>but you are my strong refuge. <br>
<sup>8</sup> My mouth shall be filled with your praise, <br>with your honor all day long. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Don’t reject me in my old age. <br>Don’t forsake me when my strength fails. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For my enemies talk about me. <br>Those who watch for my soul conspire together, <br>
<sup>11</sup> saying, “God has forsaken him. <br>Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.” <br>
<sup>12</sup> God, don’t be far from me. <br>My God, hurry to help me. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed. <br>Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me. <br>
<sup>14</sup> But I will always hope, <br>and will add to all of your praise. <br>
<sup>15</sup> My mouth will tell about your righteousness, <br>and of your salvation all day, <br>though I don’t know its full measure. <br>
<sup>16</sup> I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh. <br>I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone. <br>
<sup>17</sup> God, you have taught me from my youth. <br>Until now, I have declared your wondrous works. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don’t forsake me, <br>until I have declared your strength to the next generation, <br>your might to everyone who is to come. <br>
<sup>19</sup> God, your righteousness also reaches to the heavens. <br>You have done great things. <br>God, who is like you? <br>
<sup>20</sup> You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, <br>you will let me live. <br>You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Increase my honor <br>and comfort me again. <br>
<sup>22</sup> I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God. <br>I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel. <br>
<sup>23</sup> My lips shall shout for joy! <br>My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you! <br>
<sup>24</sup> My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long, <br>for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, <br>who want to harm me.
## Chapter 72

<sup>1</sup> God, give the king your justice; <br>your righteousness to the royal son. <br>
<sup>2</sup> He will judge your people with righteousness, <br>and your poor with justice. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people. <br>The hills bring the fruit of righteousness. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He will judge the poor of the people. <br>He will save the children of the needy, <br>and will break the oppressor in pieces. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They shall fear you while the sun endures; <br>and as long as the moon, throughout all generations. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He will come down like rain on the mown grass, <br>as showers that water the earth. <br>
<sup>7</sup> In his days, the righteous shall flourish, <br>and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, <br>from the River to the ends of the earth. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him. <br>His enemies shall lick the dust. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute. <br>The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Yes, all kings shall fall down before him. <br>All nations shall serve him. <br>
<sup>12</sup> For he will deliver the needy when he cries; <br>the poor, who has no helper. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He will have pity on the poor and needy. <br>He will save the souls of the needy. <br>
<sup>14</sup> He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence. <br>Their blood will be precious in his sight. <br>
<sup>15</sup> He will live; and Sheba’s gold will be given to him. <br>Men will pray for him continually. <br>They will bless him all day long. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land. <br>Its fruit sways like Lebanon. <br>Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field. <br>
<sup>17</sup> His name endures forever. <br>His name continues as long as the sun. <br>Men shall be blessed by him. <br>All nations will call him blessed.

<sup>18</sup> Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel, <br>who alone does marvelous deeds. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Blessed be his glorious name forever! <br>Let the whole earth be filled with his glory! <br>Amen and amen.

<sup>20</sup> This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
## Chapter 73

<sup>1</sup> Surely God<sup>a</sup> is good to Israel, <br>to those who are pure in heart. <br>
<sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet were almost gone. <br>My steps had nearly slipped. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For I was envious of the arrogant, <br>when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For there are no struggles in their death, <br>but their strength is firm. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They are free from burdens of men, <br>neither are they plagued like other men. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. <br>Violence covers them like a garment. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Their eyes bulge with fat. <br>Their minds pass the limits of conceit. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They scoff and speak with malice. <br>In arrogance, they threaten oppression. <br>
<sup>9</sup> They have set their mouth in the heavens. <br>Their tongue walks through the earth. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Therefore their people return to them, <br>and they drink up waters of abundance. <br>
<sup>11</sup> They say, “How does God know? <br>Is there knowledge in the Most High?” <br>
<sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the wicked. <br>Being always at ease, they increase in riches. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain, <br>and washed my hands in innocence, <br>
<sup>14</sup> For all day long I have been plagued, <br>and punished every morning. <br>
<sup>15</sup> If I had said, “I will speak thus”, <br>behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children. <br>
<sup>16</sup> When I tried to understand this, <br>it was too painful for me— <br>
<sup>17</sup> until I entered God’s sanctuary, <br>and considered their latter end. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Surely you set them in slippery places. <br>You throw them down to destruction. <br>
<sup>19</sup> How they are suddenly destroyed! <br>They are completely swept away with terrors. <br>
<sup>20</sup> As a dream when one wakes up, <br>so, Lord,<sup>b</sup> when you awake, you will despise their fantasies. <br>
<sup>21</sup> For my soul was grieved. <br>I was embittered in my heart. <br>
<sup>22</sup> I was so senseless and ignorant. <br>I was a brute beast before you. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Nevertheless, I am continually with you. <br>You have held my right hand. <br>
<sup>24</sup> You will guide me with your counsel, <br>and afterward receive me to glory. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Whom do I have in heaven? <br>There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you. <br>
<sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart fails, <br>but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. <br>
<sup>27</sup> For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. <br>You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you. <br>
<sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to come close to God. <br>I have made the Lord Yahweh<sup>c</sup> my refuge, <br>that I may tell of all your works.

## Chapter 74

<sup>1</sup> God, why have you rejected us forever? <br>Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture? <br>
<sup>2</sup> Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old, <br>which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance: <br>Mount Zion, in which you have lived. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, <br>all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly. <br>They have set up their standards as signs. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They behaved like men wielding axes, <br>cutting through a thicket of trees. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers. <br>
<sup>7</sup> They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. <br>They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.” <br>They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped. <br>
<sup>9</sup> We see no miraculous signs. <br>There is no longer any prophet, <br>neither is there among us anyone who knows how long. <br>
<sup>10</sup> How long, God, shall the adversary reproach? <br>Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever? <br>
<sup>11</sup> Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? <br>Take it from your chest and consume them!

<sup>12</sup> Yet God is my King of old, <br>working salvation throughout the earth. <br>
<sup>13</sup> You divided the sea by your strength. <br>You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters. <br>
<sup>14</sup> You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. <br>You gave him as food to people and desert creatures. <br>
<sup>15</sup> You opened up spring and stream. <br>You dried up mighty rivers. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The day is yours, the night is also yours. <br>You have prepared the light and the sun. <br>
<sup>17</sup> You have set all the boundaries of the earth. <br>You have made summer and winter.

<sup>18</sup> Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh. <br>Foolish people have blasphemed your name. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts. <br>Don’t forget the life of your poor forever. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Honor your covenant, <br>for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed. <br>Let the poor and needy praise your name. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Arise, God! Plead your own cause. <br>Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries. <br>The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.
## Chapter 75

<sup>1</sup> We give thanks to you, God. <br>We give thanks, for your Name is near. <br>Men tell about your wondrous works.

<sup>2</sup> When I choose the appointed time, <br>I will judge blamelessly. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The earth and all its inhabitants quake. <br>I firmly hold its pillars. <br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!” <br>I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Don’t lift up your horn on high. <br>Don’t speak with a stiff neck.” <br>
<sup>6</sup> For neither from the east, nor from the west, <br>nor yet from the south, comes exaltation. <br>
<sup>7</sup> But God is the judge. <br>He puts down one, and lifts up another. <br>
<sup>8</sup> For in Yahweh’s hand there is a cup, <br>full of foaming wine mixed with spices. <br>He pours it out. <br>Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.

<sup>9</sup> But I will declare this forever: <br>I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. <br>
<sup>10</sup> I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, <br>but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
## Chapter 76

<sup>1</sup> In Judah, God is known. <br>His name is great in Israel. <br>
<sup>2</sup> His tabernacle is also in Salem. <br>His dwelling place in Zion. <br>
<sup>3</sup> There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, <br>the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. <br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> Glorious are you, and excellent, <br>more than mountains of game. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Valiant men lie plundered, <br>they have slept their last sleep. <br>None of the men of war can lift their hands. <br>
<sup>6</sup> At your rebuke, God of Jacob, <br>both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. <br>
<sup>7</sup> You, even you, are to be feared. <br>Who can stand in your sight when you are angry? <br>
<sup>8</sup> You pronounced judgment from heaven. <br>The earth feared, and was silent, <br>
<sup>9</sup> when God arose to judgment, <br>to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. <br>Selah.

<sup>10</sup> Surely the wrath of man praises you. <br>The survivors of your wrath are restrained. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them! <br>Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared. <br>
<sup>12</sup> He will cut off the spirit of princes. <br>He is feared by the kings of the earth.
## Chapter 77

<sup>1</sup> My cry goes to God! <br>Indeed, I cry to God for help, <br>and for him to listen to me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. <br>My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired. <br>My soul refused to be comforted. <br>
<sup>3</sup> I remember God, and I groan. <br>I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. <br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> You hold my eyelids open. <br>I am so troubled that I can’t speak. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old, <br>the years of ancient times. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I remember my song in the night. <br>I consider in my own heart; <br>my spirit diligently inquires: <br>
<sup>7</sup> “Will the Lord reject us forever? <br>Will he be favorable no more? <br>
<sup>8</sup> Has his loving kindness vanished forever? <br>Does his promise fail for generations? <br>
<sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be gracious? <br>Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?” <br>Selah.

<sup>10</sup> Then I thought, “I will appeal to this: <br>the years of the right hand of the Most High.” <br>
<sup>11</sup> I will remember Yah’s deeds; <br>for I will remember your wonders of old. <br>
<sup>12</sup> I will also meditate on all your work, <br>and consider your doings. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. <br>What god is great like God? <br>
<sup>14</sup> You are the God who does wonders. <br>You have made your strength known among the peoples. <br>
<sup>15</sup> You have redeemed your people with your arm, <br>the sons of Jacob and Joseph. <br>Selah.

<sup>16</sup> The waters saw you, God. <br>The waters saw you, and they writhed. <br>The depths also convulsed. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water. <br>The skies resounded with thunder. <br>Your arrows also flashed around. <br>
<sup>18</sup> The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. <br>The lightnings lit up the world. <br>The earth trembled and shook. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Your way was through the sea, <br>your paths through the great waters. <br>Your footsteps were not known. <br>
<sup>20</sup> You led your people like a flock, <br>by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
## Chapter 78

<sup>1</sup> Hear my teaching, my people. <br>Turn your ears to the words of my mouth. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth in a parable. <br>I will utter dark sayings of old, <br>
<sup>3</sup> which we have heard and known, <br>and our fathers have told us. <br>
<sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children, <br>telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, <br>his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For he established a covenant in Jacob, <br>and appointed a teaching in Israel, <br>which he commanded our fathers, <br>that they should make them known to their children; <br>
<sup>6</sup> that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; <br>who should arise and tell their children, <br>
<sup>7</sup> that they might set their hope in God, <br>and not forget God’s deeds, <br>but keep his commandments, <br>
<sup>8</sup> and might not be as their fathers— <br>a stubborn and rebellious generation, <br>a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, <br>whose spirit was not steadfast with God. <br>
<sup>9</sup> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, <br>turned back in the day of battle. <br>
<sup>10</sup> They didn’t keep God’s covenant, <br>and refused to walk in his law. <br>
<sup>11</sup> They forgot his doings, <br>his wondrous deeds that he had shown them. <br>
<sup>12</sup> He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, <br>in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. <br>He made the waters stand as a heap. <br>
<sup>14</sup> In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, <br>and all night with a light of fire. <br>
<sup>15</sup> He split rocks in the wilderness, <br>and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. <br>
<sup>16</sup> He brought streams also out of the rock, <br>and caused waters to run down like rivers. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Yet they still went on to sin against him, <br>to rebel against the Most High in the desert. <br>
<sup>18</sup> They tempted God in their heart <br>by asking food according to their desire. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Yes, they spoke against God. <br>They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? <br>
<sup>20</sup> Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, <br>and streams overflowed. <br>Can he give bread also? <br>Will he provide meat for his people?” <br>
<sup>21</sup> Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. <br>A fire was kindled against Jacob, <br>anger also went up against Israel, <br>
<sup>22</sup> because they didn’t believe in God, <br>and didn’t trust in his salvation. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Yet he commanded the skies above, <br>and opened the doors of heaven. <br>
<sup>24</sup> He rained down manna on them to eat, <br>and gave them food from the sky. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Man ate the bread of angels. <br>He sent them food to the full. <br>
<sup>26</sup> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. <br>By his power he guided the south wind. <br>
<sup>27</sup> He also rained meat on them as the dust, <br>winged birds as the sand of the seas. <br>
<sup>28</sup> He let them fall in the middle of their camp, <br>around their habitations. <br>
<sup>29</sup> So they ate, and were well filled. <br>He gave them their own desire. <br>
<sup>30</sup> They didn’t turn from their cravings. <br>Their food was yet in their mouths, <br>
<sup>31</sup> when the anger of God went up against them, <br>killed some of their strongest, <br>and struck down the young men of Israel. <br>
<sup>32</sup> For all this they still sinned, <br>and didn’t believe in his wondrous works. <br>
<sup>33</sup> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, <br>and their years in terror. <br>
<sup>34</sup> When he killed them, then they inquired after him. <br>They returned and sought God earnestly. <br>
<sup>35</sup> They remembered that God was their rock, <br>the Most High God, their redeemer. <br>
<sup>36</sup> But they flattered him with their mouth, <br>and lied to him with their tongue. <br>
<sup>37</sup> For their heart was not right with him, <br>neither were they faithful in his covenant. <br>
<sup>38</sup> But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. <br>Yes, many times he turned his anger away, <br>and didn’t stir up all his wrath. <br>
<sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were but flesh, <br>a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again. <br>
<sup>40</sup> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, <br>and grieved him in the desert! <br>
<sup>41</sup> They turned again and tempted God, <br>and provoked the Holy One of Israel. <br>
<sup>42</sup> They didn’t remember his hand, <br>nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; <br>
<sup>43</sup> how he set his signs in Egypt, <br>his wonders in the field of Zoan, <br>
<sup>44</sup> he turned their rivers into blood, <br>and their streams, so that they could not drink. <br>
<sup>45</sup> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; <br>and frogs, which destroyed them. <br>
<sup>46</sup> He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, <br>and their labor to the locust. <br>
<sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail, <br>their sycamore fig trees with frost. <br>
<sup>48</sup> He also gave over their livestock to the hail, <br>and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. <br>
<sup>49</sup> He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, <br>wrath, indignation, and trouble, <br>and a band of angels of evil. <br>
<sup>50</sup> He made a path for his anger. <br>He didn’t spare their soul from death, <br>but gave their life over to the pestilence, <br>
<sup>51</sup> and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, <br>the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. <br>
<sup>52</sup> But he led out his own people like sheep, <br>and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. <br>
<sup>53</sup> He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, <br>but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. <br>
<sup>54</sup> He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <br>to this mountain, which his right hand had taken. <br>
<sup>55</sup> He also drove out the nations before them, <br>allotted them for an inheritance by line, <br>and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. <br>
<sup>56</sup> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, <br>and didn’t keep his testimonies, <br>
<sup>57</sup> but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. <br>They were twisted like a deceitful bow. <br>
<sup>58</sup> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, <br>and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images. <br>
<sup>59</sup> When God heard this, he was angry, <br>and greatly abhorred Israel, <br>
<sup>60</sup> so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, <br>the tent which he placed among men, <br>
<sup>61</sup> and delivered his strength into captivity, <br>his glory into the adversary’s hand. <br>
<sup>62</sup> He also gave his people over to the sword, <br>and was angry with his inheritance. <br>
<sup>63</sup> Fire devoured their young men. <br>Their virgins had no wedding song. <br>
<sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword, <br>and their widows couldn’t weep. <br>
<sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, <br>like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine. <br>
<sup>66</sup> He struck his adversaries backward. <br>He put them to a perpetual reproach. <br>
<sup>67</sup> Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, <br>and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim, <br>
<sup>68</sup> But chose the tribe of Judah, <br>Mount Zion which he loved. <br>
<sup>69</sup> He built his sanctuary like the heights, <br>like the earth which he has established forever. <br>
<sup>70</sup> He also chose David his servant, <br>and took him from the sheepfolds; <br>
<sup>71</sup> from following the ewes that have their young, <br>he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, <br>and Israel, his inheritance. <br>
<sup>72</sup> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, <br>and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
## Chapter 79

<sup>1</sup> God, the nations have come into your inheritance. <br>They have defiled your holy temple. <br>They have laid Jerusalem in heaps. <br>
<sup>2</sup> They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, <br>the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth. <br>
<sup>3</sup> They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem. <br>There was no one to bury them. <br>
<sup>4</sup> We have become a reproach to our neighbors, <br>a scoffing and derision to those who are around us. <br>
<sup>5</sup> How long, Yahweh? <br>Will you be angry forever? <br>Will your jealousy burn like fire? <br>
<sup>6</sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, <br>on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name, <br>
<sup>7</sup> for they have devoured Jacob, <br>and destroyed his homeland. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. <br>Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, <br>for we are in desperate need. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. <br>Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” <br>Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, <br>that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. <br>According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom <br>their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord. <br>
<sup>13</sup> So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, <br>will give you thanks forever. <br>We will praise you forever, to all generations.
## Chapter 80

<sup>1</sup> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, <br>you who lead Joseph like a flock, <br>you who sit above the cherubim, shine out. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your might! <br>Come to save us! <br>
<sup>3</sup> Turn us again, God. <br>Cause your face to shine, <br>and we will be saved.

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh God of Armies, <br>how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people? <br>
<sup>5</sup> You have fed them with the bread of tears, <br>and given them tears to drink in large measure. <br>
<sup>6</sup> You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. <br>Our enemies laugh among themselves. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Turn us again, God of Armies. <br>Cause your face to shine, <br>and we will be saved.

<sup>8</sup> You brought a vine out of Egypt. <br>You drove out the nations, and planted it. <br>
<sup>9</sup> You cleared the ground for it. <br>It took deep root, and filled the land. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The mountains were covered with its shadow. <br>Its boughs were like God’s cedars. <br>
<sup>11</sup> It sent out its branches to the sea, <br>its shoots to the River. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Why have you broken down its walls, <br>so that all those who pass by the way pluck it? <br>
<sup>13</sup> The boar out of the wood ravages it. <br>The wild animals of the field feed on it. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies. <br>Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine, <br>
<sup>15</sup> the stock which your right hand planted, <br>the branch that you made strong for yourself. <br>
<sup>16</sup> It’s burned with fire. <br>It’s cut down. <br>They perish at your rebuke. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, <br>on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself. <br>
<sup>18</sup> So we will not turn away from you. <br>Revive us, and we will call on your name. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies. <br>Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
## Chapter 81

<sup>1</sup> Sing aloud to God, our strength! <br>Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob! <br>
<sup>2</sup> Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, <br>the pleasant lyre with the harp. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, <br>at the full moon, on our feast day. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For it is a statute for Israel, <br>an ordinance of the God of Jacob. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He appointed it in Joseph for a covenant, <br>when he went out over the land of Egypt, <br>I heard a language that I didn’t know. <br>
<sup>6</sup> “I removed his shoulder from the burden. <br>His hands were freed from the basket. <br>
<sup>7</sup> You called in trouble, and I delivered you. <br>I answered you in the secret place of thunder. <br>I tested you at the waters of Meribah.” <br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> “Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, <br>Israel, if you would listen to me! <br>
<sup>9</sup> There shall be no strange god in you, <br>neither shall you worship any foreign god. <br>
<sup>10</sup> I am Yahweh, your God, <br>who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. <br>Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. <br>
<sup>11</sup> But my people didn’t listen to my voice. <br>Israel desired none of me. <br>
<sup>12</sup> So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, <br>that they might walk in their own counsels. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Oh that my people would listen to me, <br>that Israel would walk in my ways! <br>
<sup>14</sup> I would soon subdue their enemies, <br>and turn my hand against their adversaries. <br>
<sup>15</sup> The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, <br>and their punishment would last forever. <br>
<sup>16</sup> But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. <br>I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.”
## Chapter 82

<sup>1</sup> God presides in the great assembly. <br>He judges among the gods. <br>
<sup>2</sup> “How long will you judge unjustly, <br>and show partiality to the wicked?” <br>Selah.

<sup>3</sup> “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. <br>Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Rescue the weak and needy. <br>Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.” <br>
<sup>5</sup> They don’t know, neither do they understand. <br>They walk back and forth in darkness. <br>All the foundations of the earth are shaken. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I said, “You are gods, <br>all of you are sons of the Most High. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Nevertheless you shall die like men, <br>and fall like one of the rulers.” <br>
<sup>8</sup> Arise, God, judge the earth, <br>for you inherit all of the nations.
## Chapter 83

<sup>1</sup> God, don’t keep silent. <br>Don’t keep silent, <br>and don’t be still, God. <br>
<sup>2</sup> For, behold, your enemies are stirred up. <br>Those who hate you have lifted up their heads. <br>
<sup>3</sup> They conspire with cunning against your people. <br>They plot against your cherished ones. <br>
<sup>4</sup> “Come,” they say, “let’s destroy them as a nation, <br>that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.” <br>
<sup>5</sup> For they have conspired together with one mind. <br>They form an alliance against you. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; <br>Moab, and the Hagrites; <br>
<sup>7</sup> Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; <br>Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; <br>
<sup>8</sup> Assyria also is joined with them. <br>They have helped the children of Lot. <br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Do to them as you did to Midian, <br>as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon; <br>
<sup>10</sup> who perished at Endor, <br>who became as dung for the earth. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, <br>yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, <br>
<sup>12</sup> who said, “Let’s take possession of God’s pasture lands.” <br>
<sup>13</sup> My God, make them like tumbleweed, <br>like chaff before the wind. <br>
<sup>14</sup> As the fire that burns the forest, <br>as the flame that sets the mountains on fire, <br>
<sup>15</sup> so pursue them with your tempest, <br>and terrify them with your storm. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with confusion, <br>that they may seek your name, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever. <br>Yes, let them be confounded and perish; <br>
<sup>18</sup> that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, <br>are the Most High over all the earth.
## Chapter 84

<sup>1</sup> How lovely are your dwellings, <br>Yahweh of Armies! <br>
<sup>2</sup> My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh. <br>My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Yes, the sparrow has found a home, <br>and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young, <br>near your altars, Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Blessed are those who dwell in your house. <br>They are always praising you. <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Blessed are those whose strength is in you, <br>who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs. <br>Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings. <br>
<sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength. <br>Every one of them appears before God in Zion. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer. <br>Listen, God of Jacob. <br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Behold, God our shield, <br>look at the face of your anointed. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. <br>I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, <br>than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. <br>
<sup>11</sup> For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield. <br>Yahweh will give grace and glory. <br>He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Yahweh of Armies, <br>blessed is the man who trusts in you.
## Chapter 85

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land. <br>You have restored the fortunes of Jacob. <br>
<sup>2</sup> You have forgiven the iniquity of your people. <br>You have covered all their sin. <br>Selah.

<sup>3</sup> You have taken away all your wrath. <br>You have turned from the fierceness of your anger. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Turn us, God of our salvation, <br>and cause your indignation toward us to cease. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Will you be angry with us forever? <br>Will you draw out your anger to all generations? <br>
<sup>6</sup> Won’t you revive us again, <br>that your people may rejoice in you? <br>
<sup>7</sup> Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh. <br>Grant us your salvation. <br>
<sup>8</sup> I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, <br>for he will speak peace to his people, his saints; <br>but let them not turn again to folly. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, <br>that glory may dwell in our land. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Mercy and truth meet together. <br>Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Truth springs out of the earth. <br>Righteousness has looked down from heaven. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good. <br>Our land will yield its increase. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Righteousness goes before him, <br>and prepares the way for his steps.
## Chapter 86

<sup>1</sup> Hear, Yahweh, and answer me, <br>for I am poor and needy. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Preserve my soul, for I am godly. <br>You, my God, save your servant who trusts in you. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Be merciful to me, Lord, <br>for I call to you all day long. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Bring joy to the soul of your servant, <br>for to you, Lord, do I lift up my soul. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, <br>abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Hear, Yahweh, my prayer. <br>Listen to the voice of my petitions. <br>
<sup>7</sup> In the day of my trouble I will call on you, <br>for you will answer me. <br>
<sup>8</sup> There is no one like you among the gods, Lord, <br>nor any deeds like your deeds. <br>
<sup>9</sup> All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord. <br>They shall glorify your name. <br>
<sup>10</sup> For you are great, and do wondrous things. <br>You are God alone. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Yahweh. <br>I will walk in your truth. <br>Make my heart undivided to fear your name. <br>
<sup>12</sup> I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart. <br>I will glorify your name forever more. <br>
<sup>13</sup> For your loving kindness is great toward me. <br>You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.<sup>a</sup> <br>
<sup>14</sup> God, the proud have risen up against me. <br>A company of violent men have sought after my soul, <br>and they don’t hold regard for you before them. <br>
<sup>15</sup> But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, <br>slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me! <br>Give your strength to your servant. <br>Save the son of your servant. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Show me a sign of your goodness, <br>that those who hate me may see it, and be shamed, <br>because you, Yahweh, have helped me, and comforted me.

> - <sup>a</sup> 13. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 87

<sup>1</sup> His foundation is in the holy mountains. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. <br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> I will record Rahab<sup>a</sup> and Babylon among those who acknowledge me. <br>Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia: <br>“This one was born there.” <br>
<sup>5</sup> Yes, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one was born in her;” <br>the Most High himself will establish her. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, <br>“This one was born there.” <br>Selah.

<sup>7</sup> Those who sing as well as those who dance say, <br>“All my springs are in you.”

> - <sup>a</sup> 4. Rahab is a reference to Egypt.

## Chapter 88

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, the God of my salvation, <br>I have cried day and night before you. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer enter into your presence. <br>Turn your ear to my cry. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of troubles. <br>My life draws near to Sheol.<sup>a</sup> <br>
<sup>4</sup> I am counted among those who go down into the pit. <br>I am like a man who has no help, <br>
<sup>5</sup> set apart among the dead, <br>like the slain who lie in the grave, <br>whom you remember no more. <br>They are cut off from your hand. <br>
<sup>6</sup> You have laid me in the lowest pit, <br>in the darkest depths. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Your wrath lies heavily on me. <br>You have afflicted me with all your waves. <br>Selah.

<sup>8</sup> You have taken my friends from me. <br>You have made me an abomination to them. <br>I am confined, and I can’t escape. <br>
<sup>9</sup> My eyes are dim from grief. <br>I have called on you daily, Yahweh. <br>I have spread out my hands to you. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Do you show wonders to the dead? <br>Do the departed spirits rise up and praise you? <br>Selah.

<sup>11</sup> Is your loving kindness declared in the grave? <br>Or your faithfulness in Destruction? <br>
<sup>12</sup> Are your wonders made known in the dark? <br>Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? <br>
<sup>13</sup> But to you, Yahweh, I have cried. <br>In the morning, my prayer comes before you. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Yahweh, why do you reject my soul? <br>Why do you hide your face from me? <br>
<sup>15</sup> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. <br>While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Your fierce wrath has gone over me. <br>Your terrors have cut me off. <br>
<sup>17</sup> They came around me like water all day long. <br>They completely engulfed me. <br>
<sup>18</sup> You have put lover and friend far from me, <br>and my friends into darkness.

## Chapter 89

<sup>1</sup> I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever. <br>With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever. <br>You established the heavens. <br>Your faithfulness is in them.”

<sup>3</sup> “I have made a covenant with my chosen one, <br>I have sworn to David, my servant, <br>
<sup>4</sup> ‘I will establish your offspring forever, <br>and build up your throne to all generations.’ ” <br>Selah.

<sup>5</sup> The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh, <br>your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. <br>
<sup>6</sup> For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh? <br>Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh, <br>
<sup>7</sup> a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones, <br>to be feared above all those who are around him? <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you? <br>Yah, your faithfulness is around you. <br>
<sup>9</sup> You rule the pride of the sea. <br>When its waves rise up, you calm them. <br>
<sup>10</sup> You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain. <br>You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The heavens are yours. <br>The earth also is yours, <br>the world and its fullness. <br>You have founded them. <br>
<sup>12</sup> You have created the north and the south. <br>Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name. <br>
<sup>13</sup> You have a mighty arm. <br>Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. <br>Loving kindness and truth go before your face. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you. <br>They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>16</sup> In your name they rejoice all day. <br>In your righteousness, they are exalted. <br>
<sup>17</sup> For you are the glory of their strength. <br>In your favor, our horn will be exalted. <br>
<sup>18</sup> For our shield belongs to Yahweh, <br>our king to the Holy One of Israel.

<sup>19</sup> Then you spoke in vision to your saints, <br>and said, “I have given strength to the warrior. <br>I have exalted a young man from the people. <br>
<sup>20</sup> I have found David, my servant. <br>I have anointed him with my holy oil, <br>
<sup>21</sup> with whom my hand shall be established. <br>My arm will also strengthen him. <br>
<sup>22</sup> No enemy will tax him. <br>No wicked man will oppress him. <br>
<sup>23</sup> I will beat down his adversaries before him, <br>and strike those who hate him. <br>
<sup>24</sup> But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him. <br>In my name, his horn will be exalted. <br>
<sup>25</sup> I will set his hand also on the sea, <br>and his right hand on the rivers. <br>
<sup>26</sup> He will call to me, ‘You are my Father, <br>my God, and the rock of my salvation!’ <br>
<sup>27</sup> I will also appoint him my firstborn, <br>the highest of the kings of the earth. <br>
<sup>28</sup> I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more. <br>My covenant will stand firm with him. <br>
<sup>29</sup> I will also make his offspring endure forever, <br>and his throne as the days of heaven. <br>
<sup>30</sup> If his children forsake my law, <br>and don’t walk in my ordinances; <br>
<sup>31</sup> if they break my statutes, <br>and don’t keep my commandments; <br>
<sup>32</sup> then I will punish their sin with the rod, <br>and their iniquity with stripes. <br>
<sup>33</sup> But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him, <br>nor allow my faithfulness to fail. <br>
<sup>34</sup> I will not break my covenant, <br>nor alter what my lips have uttered. <br>
<sup>35</sup> Once I have sworn by my holiness, <br>I will not lie to David. <br>
<sup>36</sup> His offspring will endure forever, <br>his throne like the sun before me. <br>
<sup>37</sup> It will be established forever like the moon, <br>the faithful witness in the sky.” <br>Selah.

<sup>38</sup> But you have rejected and spurned. <br>You have been angry with your anointed. <br>
<sup>39</sup> You have renounced the covenant of your servant. <br>You have defiled his crown in the dust. <br>
<sup>40</sup> You have broken down all his hedges. <br>You have brought his strongholds to ruin. <br>
<sup>41</sup> All who pass by the way rob him. <br>He has become a reproach to his neighbors. <br>
<sup>42</sup> You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries. <br>You have made all of his enemies rejoice. <br>
<sup>43</sup> Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, <br>and haven’t supported him in battle. <br>
<sup>44</sup> You have ended his splendor, <br>and thrown his throne down to the ground. <br>
<sup>45</sup> You have shortened the days of his youth. <br>You have covered him with shame. <br>Selah.

<sup>46</sup> How long, Yahweh? <br>Will you hide yourself forever? <br>Will your wrath burn like fire? <br>
<sup>47</sup> Remember how short my time is, <br>for what vanity you have created all the children of men! <br>
<sup>48</sup> What man is he who shall live and not see death, <br>who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?<sup>a</sup> <br>Selah.

<sup>49</sup> Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses, <br>which you swore to David in your faithfulness? <br>
<sup>50</sup> Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants, <br>how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples, <br>
<sup>51</sup> With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh, <br>with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.

<sup>52</sup> Blessed be Yahweh forever more. <br>Amen, and Amen.

## Chapter 90

<sup>1</sup> Lord,<sup>a</sup> you have been our dwelling place for all generations. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were born, <br>before you had formed the earth and the world, <br>even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God. <br>
<sup>3</sup> You turn man to destruction, saying, <br>“Return, you children of men.” <br>
<sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past, <br>like a watch in the night. <br>
<sup>5</sup> You sweep them away as they sleep. <br>In the morning they sprout like new grass. <br>
<sup>6</sup> In the morning it sprouts and springs up. <br>By evening, it is withered and dry. <br>
<sup>7</sup> For we are consumed in your anger. <br>We are troubled in your wrath. <br>
<sup>8</sup> You have set our iniquities before you, <br>our secret sins in the light of your presence. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For all our days have passed away in your wrath. <br>We bring our years to an end as a sigh. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The days of our years are seventy, <br>or even by reason of strength eighty years; <br>yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, <br>for it passes quickly, and we fly away. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Who knows the power of your anger, <br>your wrath according to the fear that is due to you? <br>
<sup>12</sup> So teach us to count our days, <br>that we may gain a heart of wisdom. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Relent, Yahweh!<sup>b</sup> <br>How long? <br>Have compassion on your servants! <br>
<sup>14</sup> Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, <br>that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, <br>for as many years as we have seen evil. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Let your work appear to your servants, <br>your glory to their children. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us. <br>Establish the work of our hands for us. <br>Yes, establish the work of our hands.

> - <sup>a</sup> 1. The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”

## Chapter 91

<sup>1</sup> He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High <br>will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I will say of Yahweh, “He is my refuge and my fortress; <br>my God, in whom I trust.” <br>
<sup>3</sup> For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, <br>and from the deadly pestilence. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He will cover you with his feathers. <br>Under his wings you will take refuge. <br>His faithfulness is your shield and rampart. <br>
<sup>5</sup> You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, <br>nor of the arrow that flies by day, <br>
<sup>6</sup> nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, <br>nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday. <br>
<sup>7</sup> A thousand may fall at your side, <br>and ten thousand at your right hand; <br>but it will not come near you. <br>
<sup>8</sup> You will only look with your eyes, <br>and see the recompense of the wicked. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, <br>and the Most High your dwelling place, <br>
<sup>10</sup> no evil shall happen to you, <br>neither shall any plague come near your dwelling. <br>
<sup>11</sup> For he will put his angels in charge of you, <br>to guard you in all your ways. <br>
<sup>12</sup> They will bear you up in their hands, <br>so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone. <br>
<sup>13</sup> You will tread on the lion and cobra. <br>You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot. <br>
<sup>14</sup> “Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him. <br>I will set him on high, because he has known my name. <br>
<sup>15</sup> He will call on me, and I will answer him. <br>I will be with him in trouble. <br>I will deliver him, and honor him. <br>
<sup>16</sup> I will satisfy him with long life, <br>and show him my salvation.”
## Chapter 92

<sup>1</sup> It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, <br>to sing praises to your name, Most High, <br>
<sup>2</sup> to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, <br>and your faithfulness every night, <br>
<sup>3</sup> with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, <br>and with the melody of the lyre. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work. <br>I will triumph in the works of your hands. <br>
<sup>5</sup> How great are your works, Yahweh! <br>Your thoughts are very deep. <br>
<sup>6</sup> A senseless man doesn’t know, <br>neither does a fool understand this: <br>
<sup>7</sup> though the wicked spring up as the grass, <br>and all the evildoers flourish, <br>they will be destroyed forever. <br>
<sup>8</sup> But you, Yahweh, are on high forever more. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For behold, your enemies, Yahweh, <br>for behold, your enemies shall perish. <br>All the evildoers will be scattered. <br>
<sup>10</sup> But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. <br>I am anointed with fresh oil. <br>
<sup>11</sup> My eye has also seen my enemies. <br>My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. <br>He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. <br>
<sup>13</sup> They are planted in Yahweh’s house. <br>They will flourish in our God’s courts. <br>
<sup>14</sup> They will still produce fruit in old age. <br>They will be full of sap and green, <br>
<sup>15</sup> to show that Yahweh is upright. <br>He is my rock, <br>and there is no unrighteousness in him.
## Chapter 93

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh reigns! <br>He is clothed with majesty! <br>Yahweh is armed with strength. <br>The world also is established. <br>It can’t be moved. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Your throne is established from long ago. <br>You are from everlasting. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, <br>the floods have lifted up their voice. <br>The floods lift up their waves. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Above the voices of many waters, <br>the mighty breakers of the sea, <br>Yahweh on high is mighty. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Your statutes stand firm. <br>Holiness adorns your house, <br>Yahweh, forever more.
## Chapter 94

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, <br>you God to whom vengeance belongs, shine out. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Rise up, you judge of the earth. <br>Pay back the proud what they deserve. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, how long will the wicked, <br>how long will the wicked triumph? <br>
<sup>4</sup> They pour out arrogant words. <br>All the evildoers boast. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, <br>and afflict your heritage. <br>
<sup>6</sup> They kill the widow and the alien, <br>and murder the fatherless. <br>
<sup>7</sup> They say, “Yah will not see, <br>neither will Jacob’s God consider.” <br>
<sup>8</sup> Consider, you senseless among the people; <br>you fools, when will you be wise? <br>
<sup>9</sup> He who implanted the ear, won’t he hear? <br>He who formed the eye, won’t he see? <br>
<sup>10</sup> He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish? <br>He who teaches man knows. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, <br>that they are futile. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, <br>and teach out of your law, <br>
<sup>13</sup> that you may give him rest from the days of adversity, <br>until the pit is dug for the wicked. <br>
<sup>14</sup> For Yahweh won’t reject his people, <br>neither will he forsake his inheritance. <br>
<sup>15</sup> For judgment will return to righteousness. <br>All the upright in heart shall follow it. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the wicked? <br>Who will stand up for me against the evildoers? <br>
<sup>17</sup> Unless Yahweh had been my help, <br>my soul would have soon lived in silence. <br>
<sup>18</sup> When I said, “My foot is slipping!” <br>Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up. <br>
<sup>19</sup> In the multitude of my thoughts within me, <br>your comforts delight my soul. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you, <br>which brings about mischief by statute? <br>
<sup>21</sup> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, <br>and condemn the innocent blood. <br>
<sup>22</sup> But Yahweh has been my high tower, <br>my God, the rock of my refuge. <br>
<sup>23</sup> He has brought on them their own iniquity, <br>and will cut them off in their own wickedness. <br>Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.
## Chapter 95

<sup>1</sup> Oh come, let’s sing to Yahweh. <br>Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our salvation! <br>
<sup>2</sup> Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving. <br>Let’s extol him with songs! <br>
<sup>3</sup> For Yahweh is a great God, <br>a great King above all gods. <br>
<sup>4</sup> In his hand are the deep places of the earth. <br>The heights of the mountains are also his. <br>
<sup>5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it. <br>His hands formed the dry land. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Oh come, let’s worship and bow down. <br>Let’s kneel before Yahweh, our Maker, <br>
<sup>7</sup> for he is our God. <br>We are the people of his pasture, <br>and the sheep in his care. <br>Today, oh that you would hear his voice! <br>
<sup>8</sup> Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah, <br>as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, <br>
<sup>9</sup> when your fathers tempted me, <br>tested me, and saw my work. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Forty long years I was grieved with that generation, <br>and said, “They are a people who err in their heart. <br>They have not known my ways.” <br>
<sup>11</sup> Therefore I swore in my wrath, <br>“They won’t enter into my rest.”
## Chapter 96

<sup>1</sup> Sing to Yahweh a new song! <br>Sing to Yahweh, all the earth. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Sing to Yahweh! <br>Bless his name! <br>Proclaim his salvation from day to day! <br>
<sup>3</sup> Declare his glory among the nations, <br>his marvelous works among all the peoples. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For Yahweh is great, and greatly to be praised! <br>He is to be feared above all gods. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the peoples are idols, <br>but Yahweh made the heavens. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Honor and majesty are before him. <br>Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of nations, <br>ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. <br>Bring an offering, and come into his courts. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Worship Yahweh in holy array. <br>Tremble before him, all the earth. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns.” <br>The world is also established. <br>It can’t be moved. <br>He will judge the peoples with equity. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. <br>Let the sea roar, and its fullness! <br>
<sup>12</sup> Let the field and all that is in it exult! <br>Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy <br>
<sup>13</sup> before Yahweh; for he comes, <br>for he comes to judge the earth. <br>He will judge the world with righteousness, <br>the peoples with his truth.
## Chapter 97

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh reigns! <br>Let the earth rejoice! <br>Let the multitude of islands be glad! <br>
<sup>2</sup> Clouds and darkness are around him. <br>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. <br>
<sup>3</sup> A fire goes before him, <br>and burns up his adversaries on every side. <br>
<sup>4</sup> His lightning lights up the world. <br>The earth sees, and trembles. <br>
<sup>5</sup> The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, <br>at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. <br>
<sup>6</sup> The heavens declare his righteousness. <br>All the peoples have seen his glory. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images, <br>who boast in their idols. <br>Worship him, all you gods!<sup>a</sup> <br>
<sup>8</sup> Zion heard and was glad. <br>The daughters of Judah rejoiced <br>because of your judgments, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For you, Yahweh, are most high above all the earth. <br>You are exalted far above all gods. <br>
<sup>10</sup> You who love Yahweh, hate evil! <br>He preserves the souls of his saints. <br>He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Light is sown for the righteous, <br>and gladness for the upright in heart. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous people! <br>Give thanks to his holy Name.

> - <sup>a</sup> 7. LXX reads “angels” instead of “gods”.

## Chapter 98

<sup>1</sup> Sing to Yahweh a new song, <br>for he has done marvelous things! <br>His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh has made known his salvation. <br>He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations. <br>
<sup>3</sup> He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel. <br>All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth! <br>Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing praises! <br>
<sup>5</sup> Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp, <br>with the harp and the voice of melody. <br>
<sup>6</sup> With trumpets and sound of the ram’s horn, <br>make a joyful noise before the King, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Let the sea roar with its fullness; <br>the world, and those who dwell therein. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Let the rivers clap their hands. <br>Let the mountains sing for joy together. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Let them sing before Yahweh, <br>for he comes to judge the earth. <br>He will judge the world with righteousness, <br>and the peoples with equity.
## Chapter 99

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh reigns! Let the peoples tremble. <br>He sits enthroned among the cherubim. <br>Let the earth be moved. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh is great in Zion. <br>He is high above all the peoples. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Let them praise your great and awesome name. <br>He is Holy!

<sup>4</sup> The King’s strength also loves justice. <br>You establish equity. <br>You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Exalt Yahweh our God. <br>Worship at his footstool. <br>He is Holy!

<sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron were among his priests, <br>Samuel was among those who call on his name. <br>They called on Yahweh, and he answered them. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. <br>They kept his testimonies, <br>the statute that he gave them. <br>
<sup>8</sup> You answered them, Yahweh our God. <br>You are a God who forgave them, <br>although you took vengeance for their doings. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Exalt Yahweh, our God. <br>Worship at his holy hill, <br>for Yahweh, our God, is holy!
## Chapter 100

<sup>1</sup> Shout for joy to Yahweh, all you lands! <br>
<sup>2</sup> Serve Yahweh with gladness. <br>Come before his presence with singing. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Know that Yahweh, he is God. <br>It is he who has made us, and we are his. <br>We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, <br>and into his courts with praise. <br>Give thanks to him, and bless his name. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For Yahweh is good. <br>His loving kindness endures forever, <br>his faithfulness to all generations.
## Chapter 101

<sup>1</sup> I will sing of loving kindness and justice. <br>To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I will be careful to live a blameless life. <br>When will you come to me? <br>I will walk within my house with a blameless heart. <br>
<sup>3</sup> I will set no vile thing before my eyes. <br>I hate the deeds of faithless men. <br>They will not cling to me. <br>
<sup>4</sup> A perverse heart will be far from me. <br>I will have nothing to do with evil. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor. <br>I won’t tolerate one who is arrogant and conceited. <br>
<sup>6</sup> My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, <br>that they may dwell with me. <br>He who walks in a perfect way, <br>he will serve me. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He who practices deceit won’t dwell within my house. <br>He who speaks falsehood won’t be established before my eyes. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land, <br>to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh’s city.
## Chapter 102

<sup>1</sup> Hear my prayer, Yahweh! <br>Let my cry come to you. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t hide your face from me in the day of my distress. <br>Turn your ear to me. <br>Answer me quickly in the day when I call. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For my days consume away like smoke. <br>My bones are burned as a torch. <br>
<sup>4</sup> My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, <br>for I forget to eat my bread. <br>
<sup>5</sup> By reason of the voice of my groaning, <br>my bones stick to my skin. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I am like a pelican of the wilderness. <br>I have become as an owl of the waste places. <br>
<sup>7</sup> I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop. <br>
<sup>8</sup> My enemies reproach me all day. <br>Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse. <br>
<sup>9</sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread, <br>and mixed my drink with tears, <br>
<sup>10</sup> because of your indignation and your wrath; <br>for you have taken me up and thrown me away. <br>
<sup>11</sup> My days are like a long shadow. <br>I have withered like grass.

<sup>12</sup> But you, Yahweh, will remain forever; <br>your renown endures to all generations. <br>
<sup>13</sup> You will arise and have mercy on Zion, <br>for it is time to have pity on her. <br>Yes, the set time has come. <br>
<sup>14</sup> For your servants take pleasure in her stones, <br>and have pity on her dust. <br>
<sup>15</sup> So the nations will fear Yahweh’s name, <br>all the kings of the earth your glory. <br>
<sup>16</sup> For Yahweh has built up Zion. <br>He has appeared in his glory. <br>
<sup>17</sup> He has responded to the prayer of the destitute, <br>and has not despised their prayer. <br>
<sup>18</sup> This will be written for the generation to come. <br>A people which will be created will praise Yah, <br>
<sup>19</sup> for he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. <br>From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth, <br>
<sup>20</sup> to hear the groans of the prisoner, <br>to free those who are condemned to death, <br>
<sup>21</sup> that men may declare Yahweh’s name in Zion, <br>and his praise in Jerusalem, <br>
<sup>22</sup> when the peoples are gathered together, <br>the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.

<sup>23</sup> He weakened my strength along the course. <br>He shortened my days. <br>
<sup>24</sup> I said, “My God, don’t take me away in the middle of my days. <br>Your years are throughout all generations. <br>
<sup>25</sup> Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth. <br>The heavens are the work of your hands. <br>
<sup>26</sup> They will perish, but you will endure. <br>Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment. <br>You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed. <br>
<sup>27</sup> But you are the same. <br>Your years will have no end. <br>
<sup>28</sup> The children of your servants will continue. <br>Their offspring will be established before you.”
## Chapter 103

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yahweh, my soul! <br>All that is within me, praise his holy name! <br>
<sup>2</sup> Praise Yahweh, my soul, <br>and don’t forget all his benefits, <br>
<sup>3</sup> who forgives all your sins, <br>who heals all your diseases, <br>
<sup>4</sup> who redeems your life from destruction, <br>who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies, <br>
<sup>5</sup> who satisfies your desire with good things, <br>so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Yahweh executes righteous acts, <br>and justice for all who are oppressed. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He made known his ways to Moses, <br>his deeds to the children of Israel. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh is merciful and gracious, <br>slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse; <br>neither will he stay angry forever. <br>
<sup>10</sup> He has not dealt with us according to our sins, <br>nor repaid us for our iniquities. <br>
<sup>11</sup> For as the heavens are high above the earth, <br>so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him. <br>
<sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west, <br>so far has he removed our transgressions from us. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Like a father has compassion on his children, <br>so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him. <br>
<sup>14</sup> For he knows how we are made. <br>He remembers that we are dust. <br>
<sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are like grass. <br>As a flower of the field, so he flourishes. <br>
<sup>16</sup> For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. <br>Its place remembers it no more. <br>
<sup>17</sup> But Yahweh’s loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him, <br>his righteousness to children’s children, <br>
<sup>18</sup> to those who keep his covenant, <br>to those who remember to obey his precepts. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens. <br>His kingdom rules over all. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Praise Yahweh, you angels of his, <br>who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word, <br>obeying the voice of his word. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Praise Yahweh, all you armies of his, <br>you servants of his, who do his pleasure. <br>
<sup>22</sup> Praise Yahweh, all you works of his, <br>in all places of his dominion. <br>Praise Yahweh, my soul!
## Chapter 104

<sup>1</sup> Bless Yahweh, my soul. <br>Yahweh, my God, you are very great. <br>You are clothed with honor and majesty. <br>
<sup>2</sup> He covers himself with light as with a garment. <br>He stretches out the heavens like a curtain. <br>
<sup>3</sup> He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters. <br>He makes the clouds his chariot. <br>He walks on the wings of the wind. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He makes his messengers<sup>a</sup> winds, <br>and his servants flames of fire. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He laid the foundations of the earth, <br>that it should not be moved forever. <br>
<sup>6</sup> You covered it with the deep as with a cloak. <br>The waters stood above the mountains. <br>
<sup>7</sup> At your rebuke they fled. <br>At the voice of your thunder they hurried away. <br>
<sup>8</sup> The mountains rose, <br>the valleys sank down, <br>to the place which you had assigned to them. <br>
<sup>9</sup> You have set a boundary that they may not pass over, <br>that they don’t turn again to cover the earth. <br>
<sup>10</sup> He sends springs into the valleys. <br>They run among the mountains. <br>
<sup>11</sup> They give drink to every animal of the field. <br>The wild donkeys quench their thirst. <br>
<sup>12</sup> The birds of the sky nest by them. <br>They sing among the branches. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from his rooms. <br>The earth is filled with the fruit of your works. <br>
<sup>14</sup> He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, <br>and plants for man to cultivate, <br>that he may produce food out of the earth: <br>
<sup>15</sup> wine that makes the heart of man glad, <br>oil to make his face to shine, <br>and bread that strengthens man’s heart. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Yahweh’s trees are well watered, <br>the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted, <br>
<sup>17</sup> where the birds make their nests. <br>The stork makes its home in the cypress trees. <br>
<sup>18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats. <br>The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers. <br>
<sup>19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons. <br>The sun knows when to set. <br>
<sup>20</sup> You make darkness, and it is night, <br>in which all the animals of the forest prowl. <br>
<sup>21</sup> The young lions roar after their prey, <br>and seek their food from God. <br>
<sup>22</sup> The sun rises, and they steal away, <br>and lie down in their dens. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Man goes out to his work, <br>to his labor until the evening. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Yahweh, how many are your works! <br>In wisdom, you have made them all. <br>The earth is full of your riches. <br>
<sup>25</sup> There is the sea, great and wide, <br>in which are innumerable living things, <br>both small and large animals. <br>
<sup>26</sup> There the ships go, <br>and leviathan, whom you formed to play there. <br>
<sup>27</sup> These all wait for you, <br>that you may give them their food in due season. <br>
<sup>28</sup> You give to them; they gather. <br>You open your hand; they are satisfied with good. <br>
<sup>29</sup> You hide your face; they are troubled. <br>You take away their breath; they die and return to the dust. <br>
<sup>30</sup> You send out your Spirit and they are created. <br>You renew the face of the ground. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Let Yahweh’s glory endure forever. <br>Let Yahweh rejoice in his works. <br>
<sup>32</sup> He looks at the earth, and it trembles. <br>He touches the mountains, and they smoke. <br>
<sup>33</sup> I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live. <br>I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. <br>
<sup>34</sup> Let my meditation be sweet to him. <br>I will rejoice in Yahweh. <br>
<sup>35</sup> Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. <br>Let the wicked be no more. <br>Bless Yahweh, my soul. <br>Praise Yah!

## Chapter 105

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name! <br>Make his doings known among the peoples. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Sing to him, sing praises to him! <br>Tell of all his marvelous works. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Glory in his holy name. <br>Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Seek Yahweh and his strength. <br>Seek his face forever more. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Remember his marvelous works that he has done: <br>his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, <br>
<sup>6</sup> you offspring of Abraham, his servant, <br>you children of Jacob, his chosen ones. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He is Yahweh, our God. <br>His judgments are in all the earth. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He has remembered his covenant forever, <br>the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, <br>
<sup>9</sup> the covenant which he made with Abraham, <br>his oath to Isaac, <br>
<sup>10</sup> and confirmed it to Jacob for a statute; <br>to Israel for an everlasting covenant, <br>
<sup>11</sup> saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan, <br>the lot of your inheritance,” <br>
<sup>12</sup> when they were but a few men in number, <br>yes, very few, and foreigners in it. <br>
<sup>13</sup> They went about from nation to nation, <br>from one kingdom to another people. <br>
<sup>14</sup> He allowed no one to do them wrong. <br>Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes, <br>
<sup>15</sup> “Don’t touch my anointed ones! <br>Do my prophets no harm!” <br>
<sup>16</sup> He called for a famine on the land. <br>He destroyed the food supplies. <br>
<sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them. <br>Joseph was sold for a slave. <br>
<sup>18</sup> They bruised his feet with shackles. <br>His neck was locked in irons, <br>
<sup>19</sup> until the time that his word happened, <br>and Yahweh’s word proved him true. <br>
<sup>20</sup> The king sent and freed him, <br>even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. <br>
<sup>21</sup> He made him lord of his house, <br>and ruler of all of his possessions, <br>
<sup>22</sup> to discipline his princes at his pleasure, <br>and to teach his elders wisdom. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Israel also came into Egypt. <br>Jacob lived in the land of Ham. <br>
<sup>24</sup> He increased his people greatly, <br>and made them stronger than their adversaries. <br>
<sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate his people, <br>to conspire against his servants. <br>
<sup>26</sup> He sent Moses, his servant, <br>and Aaron, whom he had chosen. <br>
<sup>27</sup> They performed miracles among them, <br>and wonders in the land of Ham. <br>
<sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark. <br>They didn’t rebel against his words. <br>
<sup>29</sup> He turned their waters into blood, <br>and killed their fish. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Their land swarmed with frogs, <br>even in the rooms of their kings. <br>
<sup>31</sup> He spoke, and swarms of flies came, <br>and lice in all their borders. <br>
<sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain, <br>with lightning in their land. <br>
<sup>33</sup> He struck their vines and also their fig trees, <br>and shattered the trees of their country. <br>
<sup>34</sup> He spoke, and the locusts came <br>with the grasshoppers, without number. <br>
<sup>35</sup> They ate up every plant in their land, <br>and ate up the fruit of their ground. <br>
<sup>36</sup> He struck also all the firstborn in their land, <br>the first fruits of all their manhood. <br>
<sup>37</sup> He brought them out with silver and gold. <br>There was not one feeble person among his tribes. <br>
<sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they departed, <br>for the fear of them had fallen on them. <br>
<sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering, <br>fire to give light in the night. <br>
<sup>40</sup> They asked, and he brought quails, <br>and satisfied them with the bread of the sky. <br>
<sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. <br>They ran as a river in the dry places. <br>
<sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy word, <br>and Abraham, his servant. <br>
<sup>43</sup> He brought his people out with joy, <br>his chosen with singing. <br>
<sup>44</sup> He gave them the lands of the nations. <br>They took the labor of the peoples in possession, <br>
<sup>45</sup> that they might keep his statutes, <br>and observe his laws. <br>Praise Yah!
## Chapter 106

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yahweh! <br>Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, <br>or fully declare all his praise? <br>
<sup>3</sup> Blessed are those who keep justice. <br>Blessed is one who does what is right at all times. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people. <br>Visit me with your salvation, <br>
<sup>5</sup> that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, <br>that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, <br>that I may glory with your inheritance.

<sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers. <br>We have committed iniquity. <br>We have done wickedly. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt. <br>They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, <br>but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, <br>that he might make his mighty power known. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; <br>so he led them through the depths, as through a desert. <br>
<sup>10</sup> He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, <br>and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. <br>
<sup>11</sup> The waters covered their adversaries. <br>There was not one of them left. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Then they believed his words. <br>They sang his praise.

<sup>13</sup> They soon forgot his works. <br>They didn’t wait for his counsel, <br>
<sup>14</sup> but gave in to craving in the desert, <br>and tested God in the wasteland. <br>
<sup>15</sup> He gave them their request, <br>but sent leanness into their soul. <br>
<sup>16</sup> They envied Moses also in the camp, <br>and Aaron, Yahweh’s saint. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, <br>and covered the company of Abiram. <br>
<sup>18</sup> A fire was kindled in their company. <br>The flame burned up the wicked. <br>
<sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb, <br>and worshiped a molten image. <br>
<sup>20</sup> Thus they exchanged their glory <br>for an image of a bull that eats grass. <br>
<sup>21</sup> They forgot God, their Savior, <br>who had done great things in Egypt, <br>
<sup>22</sup> wondrous works in the land of Ham, <br>and awesome things by the Red Sea. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, <br>had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, <br>to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them. <br>
<sup>24</sup> Yes, they despised the pleasant land. <br>They didn’t believe his word, <br>
<sup>25</sup> but murmured in their tents, <br>and didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Therefore he swore to them <br>that he would overthrow them in the wilderness, <br>
<sup>27</sup> that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations, <br>and scatter them in the lands. <br>
<sup>28</sup> They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, <br>and ate the sacrifices of the dead. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. <br>The plague broke in on them. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment, <br>so the plague was stopped. <br>
<sup>31</sup> That was credited to him for righteousness, <br>for all generations to come. <br>
<sup>32</sup> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, <br>so that Moses was troubled for their sakes; <br>
<sup>33</sup> because they were rebellious against his spirit, <br>he spoke rashly with his lips. <br>
<sup>34</sup> They didn’t destroy the peoples, <br>as Yahweh commanded them, <br>
<sup>35</sup> but mixed themselves with the nations, <br>and learned their works. <br>
<sup>36</sup> They served their idols, <br>which became a snare to them. <br>
<sup>37</sup> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. <br>
<sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood, <br>even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, <br>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. <br>The land was polluted with blood. <br>
<sup>39</sup> Thus they were defiled with their works, <br>and prostituted themselves in their deeds. <br>
<sup>40</sup> Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. <br>He abhorred his inheritance. <br>
<sup>41</sup> He gave them into the hand of the nations. <br>Those who hated them ruled over them. <br>
<sup>42</sup> Their enemies also oppressed them. <br>They were brought into subjection under their hand. <br>
<sup>43</sup> He rescued them many times, <br>but they were rebellious in their counsel, <br>and were brought low in their iniquity. <br>
<sup>44</sup> Nevertheless he regarded their distress, <br>when he heard their cry. <br>
<sup>45</sup> He remembered for them his covenant, <br>and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. <br>
<sup>46</sup> He made them also to be pitied <br>by all those who carried them captive.

<sup>47</sup> Save us, Yahweh, our God, <br>gather us from among the nations, <br>to give thanks to your holy name, <br>to triumph in your praise!

<sup>48</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, <br>from everlasting even to everlasting! <br>Let all the people say, “Amen.” <br>Praise Yah!
## Chapter 107

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh,<sup>a</sup> for he is good, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, <br>whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary, <br>
<sup>3</sup> and gathered out of the lands, <br>from the east and from the west, <br>from the north and from the south.

<sup>4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. <br>They found no city to live in. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty, <br>their soul fainted in them. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, <br>and he delivered them out of their distresses. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He led them also by a straight way, <br>that they might go to a city to live in. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, <br>for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!

<sup>9</sup> For he satisfies the longing soul. <br>He fills the hungry soul with good.

<sup>10</sup> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, <br>being bound in affliction and iron, <br>
<sup>11</sup> because they rebelled against the words of God,<sup>b</sup> <br>and condemned the counsel of the Most High. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. <br>They fell down, and there was no one to help. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, <br>and he saved them out of their distresses. <br>
<sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, <br>and broke away their chains. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, <br>for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!

<sup>16</sup> For he has broken the gates of bronze, <br>and cut through bars of iron.

<sup>17</sup> Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, <br>and because of their iniquities. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Their soul abhors all kinds of food. <br>They draw near to the gates of death. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, <br>and he saves them out of their distresses. <br>
<sup>20</sup> He sends his word, and heals them, <br>and delivers them from their graves. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, <br>for his wonderful deeds to the children of men!

<sup>22</sup> Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, <br>and declare his deeds with singing.

<sup>23</sup> Those who go down to the sea in ships, <br>who do business in great waters, <br>
<sup>24</sup> these see Yahweh’s deeds, <br>and his wonders in the deep. <br>
<sup>25</sup> For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, <br>which lifts up its waves. <br>
<sup>26</sup> They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. <br>Their soul melts away because of trouble. <br>
<sup>27</sup> They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man, <br>and are at their wits’ end. <br>
<sup>28</sup> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, <br>and he brings them out of their distress. <br>
<sup>29</sup> He makes the storm a calm, <br>so that its waves are still. <br>
<sup>30</sup> Then they are glad because it is calm, <br>so he brings them to their desired haven. <br>
<sup>31</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, <br>for his wonderful deeds for the children of men!

<sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, <br>and praise him in the seat of the elders.

<sup>33</sup> He turns rivers into a desert, <br>water springs into a thirsty ground, <br>
<sup>34</sup> and a fruitful land into a salt waste, <br>for the wickedness of those who dwell in it. <br>
<sup>35</sup> He turns a desert into a pool of water, <br>and a dry land into water springs. <br>
<sup>36</sup> There he makes the hungry live, <br>that they may prepare a city to live in, <br>
<sup>37</sup> sow fields, plant vineyards, <br>and reap the fruits of increase. <br>
<sup>38</sup> He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. <br>He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease. <br>
<sup>39</sup> Again, they are diminished and bowed down <br>through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. <br>
<sup>40</sup> He pours contempt on princes, <br>and causes them to wander in a trackless waste. <br>
<sup>41</sup> Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, <br>and increases their families like a flock. <br>
<sup>42</sup> The upright will see it, and be glad. <br>All the wicked will shut their mouths. <br>
<sup>43</sup> Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things. <br>They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.

## Chapter 108

<sup>1</sup> My heart is steadfast, God. <br>I will sing and I will make music with my soul. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Wake up, harp and lyre! <br>I will wake up the dawn. <br>
<sup>3</sup> I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations. <br>I will sing praises to you among the peoples. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For your loving kindness is great above the heavens. <br>Your faithfulness reaches to the skies. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens! <br>Let your glory be over all the earth. <br>
<sup>6</sup> That your beloved may be delivered, <br>save with your right hand, and answer us. <br>
<sup>7</sup> God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph, <br>I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. <br>Ephraim also is my helmet. <br>Judah is my scepter. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Moab is my wash pot. <br>I will toss my sandal on Edom. <br>I will shout over Philistia.” <br>
<sup>10</sup> Who will bring me into the fortified city? <br>Who will lead me to Edom? <br>
<sup>11</sup> Haven’t you rejected us, God? <br>You don’t go out, God, with our armies. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Give us help against the enemy, <br>for the help of man is vain. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Through God, we will do valiantly, <br>for it is he who will tread down our enemies.
## Chapter 109

<sup>1</sup> God of my praise, don’t remain silent, <br>
<sup>2</sup> for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me. <br>They have spoken to me with a lying tongue. <br>
<sup>3</sup> They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, <br>and fought against me without a cause. <br>
<sup>4</sup> In return for my love, they are my adversaries; <br>but I am in prayer. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They have rewarded me evil for good, <br>and hatred for my love. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Set a wicked man over him. <br>Let an adversary stand at his right hand. <br>
<sup>7</sup> When he is judged, let him come out guilty. <br>Let his prayer be turned into sin. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Let his days be few. <br>Let another take his office. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless, <br>and his wife a widow. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Let his children be wandering beggars. <br>Let them be sought from their ruins. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Let the creditor seize all that he has. <br>Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Let there be no one to extend kindness to him, <br>neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off. <br>In the generation following let their name be blotted out. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh. <br>Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Let them be before Yahweh continually, <br>that he may cut off their memory from the earth; <br>
<sup>16</sup> because he didn’t remember to show kindness, <br>but persecuted the poor and needy man, <br>the broken in heart, to kill them. <br>
<sup>17</sup> Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him. <br>He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him. <br>
<sup>18</sup> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment. <br>It came into his inward parts like water, <br>like oil into his bones. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself, <br>for the belt that is always around him. <br>
<sup>20</sup> This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh, <br>of those who speak evil against my soul.

<sup>21</sup> But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord,<sup>a</sup> for your name’s sake, <br>because your loving kindness is good, deliver me; <br>
<sup>22</sup> for I am poor and needy. <br>My heart is wounded within me. <br>
<sup>23</sup> I fade away like an evening shadow. <br>I am shaken off like a locust. <br>
<sup>24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting. <br>My body is thin and lacks fat. <br>
<sup>25</sup> I have also become a reproach to them. <br>When they see me, they shake their head. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Help me, Yahweh, my God. <br>Save me according to your loving kindness; <br>
<sup>27</sup> that they may know that this is your hand; <br>that you, Yahweh, have done it. <br>
<sup>28</sup> They may curse, but you bless. <br>When they arise, they will be shamed, <br>but your servant shall rejoice. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor. <br>Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe. <br>
<sup>30</sup> I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth. <br>Yes, I will praise him among the multitude. <br>
<sup>31</sup> For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, <br>to save him from those who judge his soul.

## Chapter 110

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh says to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, <br>until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet.” <br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh will send out the rod of your strength out of Zion. <br>Rule among your enemies. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in holy array. <br>Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind: <br>“You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.” <br>
<sup>5</sup> The Lord is at your right hand. <br>He will crush kings in the day of his wrath. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He will judge among the nations. <br>He will heap up dead bodies. <br>He will crush the ruler of the whole earth. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He will drink of the brook on the way; <br>therefore he will lift up his head.
## Chapter 111

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah!<sup>a</sup> <br>I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart, <br>in the council of the upright, and in the congregation. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Yahweh’s works are great, <br>pondered by all those who delight in them. <br>
<sup>3</sup> His work is honor and majesty. <br>His righteousness endures forever. <br>
<sup>4</sup> He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered. <br>Yahweh is gracious and merciful. <br>
<sup>5</sup> He has given food to those who fear him. <br>He always remembers his covenant. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He has shown his people the power of his works, <br>in giving them the heritage of the nations. <br>
<sup>7</sup> The works of his hands are truth and justice. <br>All his precepts are sure. <br>
<sup>8</sup> They are established forever and ever. <br>They are done in truth and uprightness. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He has sent redemption to his people. <br>He has ordained his covenant forever. <br>His name is holy and awesome! <br>
<sup>10</sup> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. <br>All those who do his work have a good understanding. <br>His praise endures forever!

<sup>3</sup> Wealth and riches are in his house. <br>His righteousness endures forever. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, <br>gracious, merciful, and righteous. <br>
<sup>5</sup> It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends. <br>He will maintain his cause in judgment. <br>
<sup>6</sup> For he will never be shaken. <br>The righteous will be remembered forever. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He will not be afraid of evil news. <br>His heart is steadfast, trusting in Yahweh. <br>
<sup>8</sup> His heart is established. <br>He will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He has dispersed, he has given to the poor. <br>His righteousness endures forever. <br>His horn will be exalted with honor. <br>
<sup>10</sup> The wicked will see it, and be grieved. <br>He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away. <br>The desire of the wicked will perish.

<sup>3</sup> From the rising of the sun to its going down, <br>Yahweh’s name is to be praised. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Yahweh is high above all nations, <br>his glory above the heavens. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Who is like Yahweh, our God, <br>who has his seat on high, <br>
<sup>6</sup> who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth? <br>
<sup>7</sup> He raises up the poor out of the dust, <br>and lifts up the needy from the ash heap, <br>
<sup>8</sup> that he may set him with princes, <br>even with the princes of his people. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He settles the barren woman in her home <br>as a joyful mother of children. <br>Praise Yah!
## Chapter 114

<sup>1</sup> When Israel went out of Egypt, <br>the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language, <br>
<sup>2</sup> Judah became his sanctuary, <br>Israel his dominion. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The sea saw it, and fled. <br>The Jordan was driven back. <br>
<sup>4</sup> The mountains skipped like rams, <br>the little hills like lambs. <br>
<sup>5</sup> What was it, you sea, that you fled? <br>You Jordan, that you turned back? <br>
<sup>6</sup> You mountains, that you skipped like rams? <br>You little hills, like lambs? <br>
<sup>7</sup> Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, <br>at the presence of the God of Jacob, <br>
<sup>8</sup> who turned the rock into a pool of water, <br>the flint into a spring of waters.
## Chapter 115

<sup>1</sup> Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, <br>but to your name give glory, <br>for your loving kindness, and for your truth’s sake. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Why should the nations say, <br>“Where is their God, now?” <br>
<sup>3</sup> But our God is in the heavens. <br>He does whatever he pleases. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Their idols are silver and gold, <br>the work of men’s hands. <br>
<sup>5</sup> They have mouths, but they don’t speak. <br>They have eyes, but they don’t see. <br>
<sup>6</sup> They have ears, but they don’t hear. <br>They have noses, but they don’t smell. <br>
<sup>7</sup> They have hands, but they don’t feel. <br>They have feet, but they don’t walk, <br>neither do they speak through their throat. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Those who make them will be like them; <br>yes, everyone who trusts in them. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Israel, trust in Yahweh! <br>He is their help and their shield. <br>
<sup>10</sup> House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh! <br>He is their help and their shield. <br>
<sup>11</sup> You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh! <br>He is their help and their shield. <br>
<sup>12</sup> Yahweh remembers us. He will bless us. <br>He will bless the house of Israel. <br>He will bless the house of Aaron. <br>
<sup>13</sup> He will bless those who fear Yahweh, <br>both small and great. <br>
<sup>14</sup> May Yahweh increase you more and more, <br>you and your children. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Blessed are you by Yahweh, <br>who made heaven and earth. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The heavens are Yahweh’s heavens, <br>but he has given the earth to the children of men. <br>
<sup>17</sup> The dead don’t praise Yah, <br>nor any who go down into silence, <br>
<sup>18</sup> but we will bless Yah, <br>from this time forward and forever more. <br>Praise Yah!
## Chapter 116

<sup>1</sup> I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice, <br>and my cries for mercy. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Because he has turned his ear to me, <br>therefore I will call on him as long as I live. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The cords of death surrounded me, <br>the pains of Sheol<sup>a</sup> got a hold of me. <br>I found trouble and sorrow. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Then I called on Yahweh’s name: <br>“Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul.” <br>
<sup>5</sup> Yahweh is gracious and righteous. <br>Yes, our God is merciful. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Yahweh preserves the simple. <br>I was brought low, and he saved me. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Return to your rest, my soul, <br>for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you. <br>
<sup>8</sup> For you have delivered my soul from death, <br>my eyes from tears, <br>and my feet from falling. <br>
<sup>9</sup> I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living. <br>
<sup>10</sup> I believed, therefore I said, <br>“I was greatly afflicted.” <br>
<sup>11</sup> I said in my haste, <br>“All people are liars.” <br>
<sup>12</sup> What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me? <br>
<sup>13</sup> I will take the cup of salvation, and call on Yahweh’s name. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I will pay my vows to Yahweh, <br>yes, in the presence of all his people. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Precious in Yahweh’s sight is the death of his saints. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Yahweh, truly I am your servant. <br>I am your servant, the son of your servant girl. <br>You have freed me from my chains. <br>
<sup>17</sup> I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, <br>and will call on Yahweh’s name. <br>
<sup>18</sup> I will pay my vows to Yahweh, <br>yes, in the presence of all his people, <br>
<sup>19</sup> in the courts of Yahweh’s house, <br>in the middle of you, Jerusalem. <br>Praise Yah!

## Chapter 117

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yahweh, all you nations! <br>Extol him, all you peoples! <br>
<sup>2</sup> For his loving kindness is great toward us. <br>Yahweh’s faithfulness endures forever. <br>Praise Yah!
## Chapter 118

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Let Israel now say <br>that his loving kindness endures forever. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron now say <br>that his loving kindness endures forever. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Now let those who fear Yahweh say <br>that his loving kindness endures forever. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Out of my distress, I called on Yah. <br>Yah answered me with freedom. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Yahweh is on my side. I will not be afraid. <br>What can man do to me? <br>
<sup>7</sup> Yahweh is on my side among those who help me. <br>Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me. <br>
<sup>8</sup> It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, <br>than to put confidence in man. <br>
<sup>9</sup> It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, <br>than to put confidence in princes. <br>
<sup>10</sup> All the nations surrounded me, <br>but in Yahweh’s name I cut them off. <br>
<sup>11</sup> They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me. <br>In Yahweh’s name I indeed cut them off. <br>
<sup>12</sup> They surrounded me like bees. <br>They are quenched like the burning thorns. <br>In Yahweh’s name I cut them off. <br>
<sup>13</sup> You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, <br>but Yahweh helped me. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Yah is my strength and song. <br>He has become my salvation. <br>
<sup>15</sup> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous. <br>“The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly. <br>
<sup>16</sup> The right hand of Yahweh is exalted! <br>The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly!” <br>
<sup>17</sup> I will not die, but live, <br>and declare Yah’s works. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Yah has punished me severely, <br>but he has not given me over to death. <br>
<sup>19</sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness. <br>I will enter into them. <br>I will give thanks to Yah. <br>
<sup>20</sup> This is the gate of Yahweh; <br>the righteous will enter into it. <br>
<sup>21</sup> I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me, <br>and have become my salvation. <br>
<sup>22</sup> The stone which the builders rejected <br>has become the cornerstone.<sup>a</sup> <br>
<sup>23</sup> This is Yahweh’s doing. <br>It is marvelous in our eyes. <br>
<sup>24</sup> This is the day that Yahweh has made. <br>We will rejoice and be glad in it! <br>
<sup>25</sup> Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh! <br>Yahweh, we beg you, send prosperity now. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Blessed is he who comes in Yahweh’s name! <br>We have blessed you out of Yahweh’s house. <br>
<sup>27</sup> Yahweh is God, and he has given us light. <br>Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar. <br>
<sup>28</sup> You are my God, and I will give thanks to you. <br>You are my God, I will exalt you. <br>
<sup>29</sup> Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever.

<sup>51</sup> The arrogant mock me excessively, <br>but I don’t swerve from your law. <br>
<sup>52</sup> I remember your ordinances of old, Yahweh, <br>and have comforted myself. <br>
<sup>53</sup> Indignation has taken hold on me, <br>because of the wicked who forsake your law. <br>
<sup>54</sup> Your statutes have been my songs <br>in the house where I live. <br>
<sup>55</sup> I have remembered your name, Yahweh, in the night, <br>and I obey your law. <br>
<sup>56</sup> This is my way, <br>that I keep your precepts.

<sup>62</sup> At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you, <br>because of your righteous ordinances. <br>
<sup>63</sup> I am a friend of all those who fear you, <br>of those who observe your precepts. <br>
<sup>64</sup> The earth is full of your loving kindness, Yahweh. <br>Teach me your statutes.

<sup>65</sup> You have treated your servant well, <br>according to your word, Yahweh. <br>

<sup>69</sup> The proud have smeared a lie upon me. <br>With my whole heart, I will keep your precepts. <br>
<sup>70</sup> Their heart is as callous as the fat, <br>but I delight in your law. <br>
<sup>71</sup> It is good for me that I have been afflicted, <br>that I may learn your statutes. <br>
<sup>72</sup> The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver.

<sup>73</sup> Your hands have made me and formed me. <br>Give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments. <br>
<sup>74</sup> Those who fear you will see me and be glad, <br>because I have put my hope in your word. <br>

<sup>80</sup> Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees, <br>that I may not be disappointed.

<sup>81</sup> My soul faints for your salvation. <br>I hope in your word. <br>
<sup>82</sup> My eyes fail for your word. <br>I say, “When will you comfort me?” <br>
<sup>83</sup> For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke. <br>I don’t forget your statutes. <br>
<sup>84</sup> How many are the days of your servant? <br>When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me? <br>
<sup>85</sup> The proud have dug pits for me, <br>contrary to your law. <br>
<sup>86</sup> All of your commandments are faithful. <br>They persecute me wrongfully. <br>Help me! <br>
<sup>87</sup> They had almost wiped me from the earth, <br>but I didn’t forsake your precepts. <br>
<sup>88</sup> Preserve my life according to your loving kindness, <br>so I will obey the statutes of your mouth.

<sup>89</sup> Yahweh, your word is settled in heaven forever. <br>
<sup>90</sup> Your faithfulness is to all generations. <br>You have established the earth, and it remains. <br>
<sup>91</sup> Your laws remain to this day, <br>for all things serve you. <br>

<sup>93</sup> I will never forget your precepts, <br>for with them, you have revived me. <br>
<sup>94</sup> I am yours. <br>Save me, for I have sought your precepts. <br>
<sup>95</sup> The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me. <br>I will consider your statutes. <br>
<sup>96</sup> I have seen a limit to all perfection, <br>but your commands are boundless.

<sup>97</sup> How I love your law! <br>It is my meditation all day. <br>

<sup>102</sup> I have not turned away from your ordinances, <br>for you have taught me. <br>
<sup>103</sup> How sweet are your promises to my taste, <br>more than honey to my mouth! <br>
<sup>104</sup> Through your precepts, I get understanding; <br>therefore I hate every false way.

<sup>105</sup> Your word is a lamp to my feet, <br>and a light for my path. <br>
<sup>106</sup> I have sworn, and have confirmed it, <br>that I will obey your righteous ordinances. <br>
<sup>107</sup> I am afflicted very much. <br>Revive me, Yahweh, according to your word. <br>
<sup>108</sup> Accept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth. <br>Yahweh, teach me your ordinances. <br>

<sup>112</sup> I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever, <br>even to the end.

<sup>113</sup> I hate double-minded men, <br>but I love your law. <br>
<sup>114</sup> You are my hiding place and my shield. <br>I hope in your word. <br>
<sup>115</sup> Depart from me, you evildoers, <br>that I may keep the commandments of my God. <br>
<sup>116</sup> Uphold me according to your word, that I may live. <br>Let me not be ashamed of my hope. <br>
<sup>117</sup> Hold me up, and I will be safe, <br>and will have respect for your statutes continually. <br>
<sup>118</sup> You reject all those who stray from your statutes, <br>for their deceit is in vain. <br>
<sup>119</sup> You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross. <br>Therefore I love your testimonies. <br>
<sup>120</sup> My flesh trembles for fear of you. <br>I am afraid of your judgments.

<sup>121</sup> I have done what is just and righteous. <br>Don’t leave me to my oppressors. <br>
<sup>122</sup> Ensure your servant’s well-being. <br>Don’t let the proud oppress me. <br>
<sup>123</sup> My eyes fail looking for your salvation, <br>for your righteous word. <br>
<sup>124</sup> Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness. <br>Teach me your statutes. <br>

<sup>129</sup> Your testimonies are wonderful, <br>therefore my soul keeps them. <br>
<sup>130</sup> The entrance of your words gives light. <br>It gives understanding to the simple. <br>

<sup>132</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me, <br>as you always do to those who love your name. <br>
<sup>133</sup> Establish my footsteps in your word. <br>Don’t let any iniquity have dominion over me. <br>
<sup>134</sup> Redeem me from the oppression of man, <br>so I will observe your precepts. <br>
<sup>135</sup> Make your face shine on your servant. <br>Teach me your statutes. <br>
<sup>136</sup> Streams of tears run down my eyes, <br>because they don’t observe your law.

<sup>137</sup> You are righteous, Yahweh. <br>Your judgments are upright. <br>
<sup>138</sup> You have commanded your statutes in righteousness. <br>They are fully trustworthy. <br>
<sup>139</sup> My zeal wears me out, <br>because my enemies ignore your words. <br>

<sup>1</sup> In my distress, I cried to Yahweh. <br>He answered me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips, <br>from a deceitful tongue. <br>
<sup>3</sup> What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you, <br>you deceitful tongue? <br>
<sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows of the mighty, <br>with coals of juniper. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, <br>that I dwell among the tents of Kedar! <br>

<sup>1</sup> I was glad when they said to me, <br>“Let’s go to Yahweh’s house!” <br>
<sup>2</sup> Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem! <br>
<sup>3</sup> Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together, <br>
<sup>4</sup> where the tribes go up, even Yah’s tribes, <br>according to an ordinance for Israel, <br>to give thanks to Yahweh’s name. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For there are set thrones for judgment, <br>the thrones of David’s house. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. <br>Those who love you will prosper. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Peace be within your walls, <br>and prosperity within your palaces. <br>
<sup>8</sup> For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes, <br>I will now say, “Peace be within you.” <br>
<sup>9</sup> For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, <br>I will seek your good.
## Chapter 123

<sup>1</sup> I lift up my eyes to you, <br>you who sit in the heavens. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, <br>as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, <br>so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, <br>until he has mercy on us. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, <br>for we have endured much contempt. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, <br>with the contempt of the proud.
## Chapter 124

<sup>1</sup> If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, <br>let Israel now say, <br>
<sup>2</sup> if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, <br>when men rose up against us, <br>
<sup>3</sup> then they would have swallowed us up alive, <br>when their wrath was kindled against us, <br>
<sup>4</sup> then the waters would have overwhelmed us, <br>the stream would have gone over our soul. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Then the proud waters would have gone over our soul. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, <br>who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare. <br>The snare is broken, and we have escaped. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Our help is in Yahweh’s name, <br>who made heaven and earth.
## Chapter 125

<sup>1</sup> Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, <br>which can’t be moved, but remains forever. <br>
<sup>2</sup> As the mountains surround Jerusalem, <br>so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous, <br>so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, <br>to those who are upright in their hearts. <br>
<sup>5</sup> But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways, <br>Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. <br>Peace be on Israel.
## Chapter 126

<sup>1</sup> When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion, <br>we were like those who dream. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Then our mouth was filled with laughter, <br>and our tongue with singing. <br>Then they said among the nations, <br>“Yahweh has done great things for them.” <br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh has done great things for us, <br>and we are glad. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, <br>like the streams in the Negev. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Those who sow in tears will reap in joy. <br>
<sup>6</sup> He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, <br>will certainly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
## Chapter 127

<sup>1</sup> Unless Yahweh builds the house, <br>they who build it labor in vain. <br>Unless Yahweh watches over the city, <br>the watchman guards it in vain. <br>
<sup>2</sup> It is vain for you to rise up early, <br>to stay up late, <br>eating the bread of toil, <br>for he gives sleep to his loved ones. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh. <br>The fruit of the womb is his reward. <br>
<sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, <br>so are the children of youth. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. <br>They won’t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
## Chapter 128

<sup>1</sup> Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh, <br>who walks in his ways. <br>
<sup>2</sup> For you will eat the labor of your hands. <br>You will be happy, and it will be well with you. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Your wife will be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house, <br>your children like olive shoots around your table. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Behold, this is how the man who fears Yahweh is blessed. <br>
<sup>5</sup> May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, <br>and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Yes, may you see your children’s children. <br>Peace be upon Israel.
## Chapter 129

<sup>1</sup> Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. <br>Let Israel now say: <br>
<sup>2</sup> many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, <br>yet they have not prevailed against me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> The plowers plowed on my back. <br>They made their furrows long. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Yahweh is righteous. <br>He has cut apart the cords of the wicked. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Let them be disappointed and turned backward, <br>all those who hate Zion. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass on the housetops, <br>which withers before it grows up, <br>
<sup>7</sup> with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand, <br>nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Neither do those who go by say, <br>“The blessing of Yahweh be on you. <br>We bless you in Yahweh’s name.”
## Chapter 130

<sup>1</sup> Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Lord, hear my voice. <br>Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions. <br>
<sup>3</sup> If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, <br>Lord, who could stand? <br>
<sup>4</sup> But there is forgiveness with you, <br>therefore you are feared. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I wait for Yahweh. <br>My soul waits. <br>I hope in his word. <br>
<sup>6</sup> My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning, <br>more than watchmen for the morning. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Israel, hope in Yahweh, <br>for there is loving kindness with Yahweh. <br>Abundant redemption is with him. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
## Chapter 131

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, my heart isn’t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty; <br>nor do I concern myself with great matters, <br>or things too wonderful for me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, <br>like a weaned child with his mother, <br>like a weaned child is my soul within me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Israel, hope in Yahweh, <br>from this time forward and forever more.
## Chapter 132

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction, <br>
<sup>2</sup> how he swore to Yahweh, <br>and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: <br>
<sup>3</sup> “Surely I will not come into the structure of my house, <br>nor go up into my bed; <br>
<sup>4</sup> I will not give sleep to my eyes, <br>or slumber to my eyelids, <br>
<sup>5</sup> until I find out a place for Yahweh, <br>a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.” <br>
<sup>6</sup> Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah. <br>We found it in the field of Jaar. <br>
<sup>7</sup> “We will go into his dwelling place. <br>We will worship at his footstool.” <br>
<sup>8</sup> Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place, <br>you, and the ark of your strength. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Let your priests be clothed with righteousness. <br>Let your saints shout for joy! <br>
<sup>10</sup> For your servant David’s sake, <br>don’t turn away the face of your anointed one. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Yahweh has sworn to David in truth. <br>He will not turn from it: <br>“I will set the fruit of your body on your throne. <br>
<sup>12</sup> If your children will keep my covenant, <br>my testimony that I will teach them, <br>their children also will sit on your throne forever more.” <br>
<sup>13</sup> For Yahweh has chosen Zion. <br>He has desired it for his habitation. <br>
<sup>14</sup> “This is my resting place forever. <br>I will live here, for I have desired it. <br>
<sup>15</sup> I will abundantly bless her provision. <br>I will satisfy her poor with bread. <br>
<sup>16</sup> I will also clothe her priests with salvation. <br>Her saints will shout aloud for joy. <br>
<sup>17</sup> I will make the horn of David to bud there. <br>I have ordained a lamp for my anointed. <br>
<sup>18</sup> I will clothe his enemies with shame, <br>but on himself, his crown will shine.”
## Chapter 133

<sup>1</sup> See how good and how pleasant it is <br>for brothers to live together in unity! <br>
<sup>2</sup> It is like the precious oil on the head, <br>that ran down on the beard, <br>even Aaron’s beard, <br>that came down on the edge of his robes, <br>
<sup>3</sup> like the dew of Hermon, <br>that comes down on the hills of Zion; <br>for there Yahweh gives the blessing, <br>even life forever more.
## Chapter 134

<sup>1</sup> Look! Praise Yahweh, all you servants of Yahweh, <br>who stand by night in Yahweh’s house! <br>
<sup>2</sup> Lift up your hands in the sanctuary. <br>Praise Yahweh! <br>
<sup>3</sup> May Yahweh bless you from Zion, <br>even he who made heaven and earth.
## Chapter 135

<sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! <br>Praise Yahweh’s name! <br>Praise him, you servants of Yahweh, <br>
<sup>2</sup> you who stand in Yahweh’s house, <br>in the courts of our God’s house. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good. <br>Sing praises to his name, for that is pleasant. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself, <br>Israel for his own possession. <br>
<sup>5</sup> For I know that Yahweh is great, <br>that our Lord is above all gods. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, <br>in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps. <br>
<sup>7</sup> He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. <br>He makes lightnings with the rain. <br>He brings the wind out of his treasuries. <br>
<sup>8</sup> He struck the firstborn of Egypt, <br>both of man and animal. <br>
<sup>9</sup> He sent signs and wonders into the middle of you, Egypt, <br>on Pharaoh, and on all his servants. <br>
<sup>10</sup> He struck many nations, <br>and killed mighty kings— <br>
<sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, <br>Og king of Bashan, <br>and all the kingdoms of Canaan— <br>
<sup>12</sup> and gave their land for a heritage, <br>a heritage to Israel, his people. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; <br>your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations. <br>
<sup>14</sup> For Yahweh will judge his people <br>and have compassion on his servants.

<sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are silver and gold, <br>the work of men’s hands. <br>
<sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but they can’t speak. <br>They have eyes, but they can’t see. <br>
<sup>17</sup> They have ears, but they can’t hear, <br>neither is there any breath in their mouths. <br>
<sup>18</sup> Those who make them will be like them, <br>yes, everyone who trusts in them. <br>
<sup>19</sup> House of Israel, praise Yahweh! <br>House of Aaron, praise Yahweh! <br>
<sup>20</sup> House of Levi, praise Yahweh! <br>You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh! <br>
<sup>21</sup> Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, <br>who dwells in Jerusalem. <br>Praise Yah!
## Chapter 136

<sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Give thanks to the God of gods, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Give thanks to the Lord of lords, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>4</sup> to him who alone does great wonders, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>5</sup> to him who by understanding made the heavens, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>6</sup> to him who spread out the earth above the waters, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>7</sup> to him who made the great lights, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>8</sup> the sun to rule by day, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>9</sup> the moon and stars to rule by night, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>10</sup> to him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>11</sup> and brought out Israel from among them, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>12</sup> with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>13</sup> to him who divided the Red Sea apart, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>14</sup> and made Israel to pass through the middle of it, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>15</sup> but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>16</sup> to him who led his people through the wilderness, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>17</sup> to him who struck great kings, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>18</sup> and killed mighty kings, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>19</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>20</sup> Og king of Bashan, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>21</sup> and gave their land as an inheritance, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>22</sup> even a heritage to Israel his servant, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>23</sup> who remembered us in our low estate, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>24</sup> and has delivered us from our adversaries, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever; <br>
<sup>25</sup> who gives food to every creature, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever. <br>
<sup>26</sup> Oh give thanks to the God of heaven, <br>for his loving kindness endures forever.
## Chapter 137

<sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. <br>Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion. <br>
<sup>2</sup> On the willows in that land, <br>we hung up our harps. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs. <br>Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: <br>“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!” <br>
<sup>4</sup> How can we sing Yahweh’s song in a foreign land? <br>
<sup>5</sup> If I forget you, Jerusalem, <br>let my right hand forget its skill. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t remember you, <br>if I don’t prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem, <br>who said, “Raze it! <br>Raze it even to its foundation!” <br>
<sup>8</sup> Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, <br>he will be happy who repays you, <br>as you have done to us. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Happy shall he be, <br>who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
## Chapter 138

<sup>1</sup> I will give you thanks with my whole heart. <br>Before the gods,<sup>a</sup> I will sing praises to you. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I will bow down toward your holy temple, <br>and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth; <br>for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all. <br>
<sup>3</sup> In the day that I called, you answered me. <br>You encouraged me with strength in my soul. <br>
<sup>4</sup> All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh, <br>for they have heard the words of your mouth. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, <br>for Yahweh’s glory is great! <br>
<sup>6</sup> For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly; <br>but he knows the proud from afar. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Though I walk in the middle of trouble, you will revive me. <br>You will stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies. <br>Your right hand will save me. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me. <br>Your loving kindness, Yahweh, endures forever. <br>Don’t forsake the works of your own hands.

> - <sup>a</sup> 1. The word elohim, used here, usually means “God” but can also mean “gods”, “princes”, or “angels”.

## Chapter 139

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you have searched me, <br>and you know me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> You know my sitting down and my rising up. <br>You perceive my thoughts from afar. <br>
<sup>3</sup> You search out my path and my lying down, <br>and are acquainted with all my ways. <br>
<sup>4</sup> For there is not a word on my tongue, <br>but behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether. <br>
<sup>5</sup> You hem me in behind and before. <br>You laid your hand on me. <br>
<sup>6</sup> This knowledge is beyond me. <br>It’s lofty. <br>I can’t attain it. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Where could I go from your Spirit? <br>Or where could I flee from your presence? <br>
<sup>8</sup> If I ascend up into heaven, you are there. <br>If I make my bed in Sheol,<sup>a</sup> behold, you are there! <br>
<sup>9</sup> If I take the wings of the dawn, <br>and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea, <br>
<sup>10</sup> even there your hand will lead me, <br>and your right hand will hold me. <br>
<sup>11</sup> If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me. <br>The light around me will be night,” <br>
<sup>12</sup> even the darkness doesn’t hide from you, <br>but the night shines as the day. <br>The darkness is like light to you. <br>
<sup>13</sup> For you formed my inmost being. <br>You knit me together in my mother’s womb. <br>
<sup>14</sup> I will give thanks to you, <br>for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. <br>Your works are wonderful. <br>My soul knows that very well. <br>
<sup>15</sup> My frame wasn’t hidden from you, <br>when I was made in secret, <br>woven together in the depths of the earth. <br>
<sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw my body. <br>In your book they were all written, <br>the days that were ordained for me, <br>when as yet there were none of them. <br>
<sup>17</sup> How precious to me are your thoughts, God! <br>How vast is their sum! <br>
<sup>18</sup> If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand. <br>When I wake up, I am still with you. <br>
<sup>19</sup> If only you, God, would kill the wicked. <br>Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men! <br>
<sup>20</sup> For they speak against you wickedly. <br>Your enemies take your name in vain. <br>
<sup>21</sup> Yahweh, don’t I hate those who hate you? <br>Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you? <br>
<sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred. <br>They have become my enemies. <br>
<sup>23</sup> Search me, God, and know my heart. <br>Try me, and know my thoughts. <br>
<sup>24</sup> See if there is any wicked way in me, <br>and lead me in the everlasting way.

> - <sup>a</sup> 8. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 140

<sup>1</sup> Deliver me, Yahweh, from evil men. <br>Preserve me from violent men: <br>
<sup>2</sup> those who devise mischief in their hearts. <br>They continually gather themselves together for war. <br>
<sup>3</sup> They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. <br>Viper’s poison is under their lips. <br>Selah.

<sup>4</sup> Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked. <br>Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet. <br>
<sup>5</sup> The proud have hidden a snare for me, <br>they have spread the cords of a net by the path. <br>They have set traps for me. <br>Selah.

<sup>6</sup> I said to Yahweh, “You are my God.” <br>Listen to the cry of my petitions, Yahweh. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, <br>you have covered my head in the day of battle. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh, don’t grant the desires of the wicked. <br>Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. <br>Selah.

<sup>9</sup> As for the head of those who surround me, <br>let the mischief of their own lips cover them. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Let burning coals fall on them. <br>Let them be thrown into the fire, <br>into miry pits, from where they never rise. <br>
<sup>11</sup> An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth. <br>Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him. <br>
<sup>12</sup> I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, <br>and justice for the needy. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name. <br>The upright will dwell in your presence.
## Chapter 141

<sup>1</sup> Yahweh, I have called on you. <br>Come to me quickly! <br>Listen to my voice when I call to you. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer be set before you like incense; <br>the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth. <br>Keep the door of my lips. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing, <br>to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity. <br>Don’t let me eat of their delicacies. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; <br>let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head; <br>don’t let my head refuse it; <br>Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. <br>They will hear my words, for they are well spoken. <br>
<sup>7</sup> “As when one plows and breaks up the earth, <br>our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”<sup>a</sup> <br>
<sup>8</sup> For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord. <br>I take refuge in you. <br>Don’t leave my soul destitute. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, <br>from the traps of the workers of iniquity. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall together into their own nets <br>while I pass by.

> - <sup>a</sup> 7. Sheol is the place of the dead.

## Chapter 142

<sup>1</sup> I cry with my voice to Yahweh. <br>With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy. <br>
<sup>2</sup> I pour out my complaint before him. <br>I tell him my troubles. <br>
<sup>3</sup> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, <br>you knew my route. <br>On the path in which I walk, <br>they have hidden a snare for me. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Look on my right, and see; <br>for there is no one who is concerned for me. <br>Refuge has fled from me. <br>No one cares for my soul. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I cried to you, Yahweh. <br>I said, “You are my refuge, <br>my portion in the land of the living.” <br>
<sup>6</sup> Listen to my cry, <br>for I am in desperate need. <br>Deliver me from my persecutors, <br>for they are too strong for me. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Bring my soul out of prison, <br>that I may give thanks to your name. <br>The righteous will surround me, <br>for you will be good to me.
## Chapter 143

<sup>1</sup> Hear my prayer, Yahweh. <br>Listen to my petitions. <br>In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Don’t enter into judgment with your servant, <br>for in your sight no man living is righteous. <br>
<sup>3</sup> For the enemy pursues my soul. <br>He has struck my life down to the ground. <br>He has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead. <br>
<sup>4</sup> Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me. <br>My heart within me is desolate. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I remember the days of old. <br>I meditate on all your doings. <br>I contemplate the work of your hands. <br>
<sup>6</sup> I spread out my hands to you. <br>My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land. <br>Selah.

<sup>7</sup> Hurry to answer me, Yahweh. <br>My spirit fails. <br>Don’t hide your face from me, <br>so that I don’t become like those who go down into the pit. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, <br>for I trust in you. <br>Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, <br>for I lift up my soul to you. <br>
<sup>9</sup> Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies. <br>I flee to you to hide me. <br>
<sup>10</sup> Teach me to do your will, <br>for you are my God. <br>Your Spirit is good. <br>Lead me in the land of uprightness. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Revive me, Yahweh, for your name’s sake. <br>In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble. <br>
<sup>12</sup> In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, <br>and destroy all those who afflict my soul, <br>for I am your servant.
## Chapter 144

<sup>1</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, <br>who trains my hands to war, <br>and my fingers to battle— <br>
<sup>2</sup> my loving kindness, my fortress, <br>my high tower, my deliverer, <br>my shield, and he in whom I take refuge, <br>who subdues my people under me. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him? <br>Or the son of man, that you think of him? <br>
<sup>4</sup> Man is like a breath. <br>His days are like a shadow that passes away. <br>
<sup>5</sup> Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down. <br>Touch the mountains, and they will smoke. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Throw out lightning, and scatter them. <br>Send out your arrows, and rout them. <br>
<sup>7</sup> Stretch out your hand from above, <br>rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, <br>out of the hands of foreigners, <br>
<sup>8</sup> whose mouths speak deceit, <br>whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. <br>
<sup>9</sup> I will sing a new song to you, God. <br>On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you. <br>
<sup>10</sup> You are he who gives salvation to kings, <br>who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword. <br>
<sup>11</sup> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners, <br>whose mouths speak deceit, <br>whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

<sup>12</sup> Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, <br>our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace. <br>
<sup>13</sup> Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision. <br>Our sheep produce thousands and ten thousands in our fields. <br>
<sup>14</sup> Our oxen will pull heavy loads. <br>There is no breaking in, and no going away, <br>and no outcry in our streets. <br>
<sup>15</sup> Happy are the people who are in such a situation. <br>Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.
## Chapter 145

<sup>1</sup> I will exalt you, my God, the King. <br>I will praise your name forever and ever. <br>
<sup>2</sup> Every day I will praise you. <br>I will extol your name forever and ever. <br>
<sup>3</sup> Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised! <br>His greatness is unsearchable. <br>
<sup>4</sup> One generation will commend your works to another, <br>and will declare your mighty acts. <br>
<sup>5</sup> I will meditate on the glorious majesty of your honor, <br>on your wondrous works. <br>
<sup>6</sup> Men will speak of the might of your awesome acts. <br>I will declare your greatness. <br>
<sup>7</sup> They will utter the memory of your great goodness, <br>and will sing of your righteousness. <br>
<sup>8</sup> Yahweh is gracious, merciful, <br>slow to anger, and of great loving kindness. <br>
