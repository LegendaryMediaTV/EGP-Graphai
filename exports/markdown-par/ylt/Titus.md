## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that is according to piety,
<sup>2</sup> upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,
<sup>3</sup> (and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,
<sup>4</sup> to Titus-true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!
<sup>5</sup> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;
<sup>6</sup> if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate-
<sup>7</sup> for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;
<sup>8</sup> but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,
<sup>9</sup> holding-according to the teaching-to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;
<sup>10</sup> for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers-especially they of the circumcision-
<sup>11</sup> whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
<sup>12</sup> A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said-‘Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!’
<sup>13</sup> this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
<sup>14</sup> not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;
<sup>15</sup> all things, indeed, are pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast is nothing pure, but of them defiled are even the mind and the conscience;
<sup>16</sup> God they profess to know, and in the works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.
## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> And thou-be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;
<sup>2</sup> aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;
<sup>3</sup> aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,
<sup>4</sup> that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,
<sup>5</sup> sober, pure, keepers of their own houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.
<sup>6</sup> The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;
<sup>7</sup> concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,
<sup>8</sup> discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.
<sup>9</sup> Servants-to their own masters are to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,
<sup>10</sup> not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.
<sup>11</sup> For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,
<sup>12</sup> teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,
<sup>13</sup> waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
<sup>14</sup> who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;
<sup>15</sup> these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!
## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,
<sup>2</sup> of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome-gentle, showing all meekness to all men,
<sup>3</sup> for we were once-also we-thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious-hating one another;
<sup>4</sup> and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear
<sup>5</sup> (not by works that are in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,
<sup>6</sup> which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,
<sup>7</sup> that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.
<sup>8</sup> Stedfast is the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works-who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,
<sup>9</sup> and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from-for they are unprofitable and vain.
<sup>10</sup> A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,
<sup>11</sup> having known that he hath been subverted who is such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.
<sup>12</sup> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.
<sup>13</sup> Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,
<sup>14</sup> and let them learn-ours also-to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
<sup>15</sup> Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace is with you all!
