## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!
<sup>2</sup> beloved, concerning all things I desire thee to prosper, and to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper,
<sup>3</sup> for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk;
<sup>4</sup> greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking.
<sup>5</sup> Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work to the brethren and to the strangers,
<sup>6</sup> who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,
<sup>7</sup> because for His name they went forth, nothing receiving from the nations;
<sup>8</sup> we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may become to the truth.
<sup>9</sup> I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them-Diotrephes-doth not receive us;
<sup>10</sup> because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast.
<sup>11</sup> Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil hath not seen God;
<sup>12</sup> to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all, and by the truth itself, and we also-we do testify, and ye have known that our testimony is true.
<sup>13</sup> Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to thee,
<sup>14</sup> and I hope straightway to see thee, and mouth to mouth we shall speak.
<sup>15</sup> Peace to thee! salute thee do the friends; be saluting the friends by name.
