## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
<sup>2</sup> and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house:
<sup>3</sup> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
<sup>4</sup> I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my prayers,
<sup>5</sup> hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
<sup>6</sup> that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that is in you toward Christ Jesus;
<sup>7</sup> for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
<sup>8</sup> Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit-
<sup>9</sup> because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;
<sup>10</sup> I entreat thee concerning my child-whom I did beget in my bonds-Onesimus,
<sup>11</sup> who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to thee,
<sup>12</sup> whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own bowels) receive,
<sup>13</sup> whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,
<sup>14</sup> and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,
<sup>15</sup> for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him,
<sup>16</sup> no more as a servant, but above a servant-a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord!
<sup>17</sup> If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,
<sup>18</sup> and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to me be reckoning;
<sup>19</sup> I, Paul did write with my hand, I-I will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe.
<sup>20</sup> Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord;
<sup>21</sup> having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;
<sup>22</sup> and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.
<sup>23</sup> Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)
<sup>24</sup> Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!
<sup>25</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit! Amen.
