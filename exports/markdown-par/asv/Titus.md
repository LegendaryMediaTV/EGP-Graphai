## Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
<sup>2</sup> in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;
<sup>3</sup> but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
<sup>4</sup> to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
<sup>5</sup> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;
<sup>6</sup> if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.
<sup>7</sup> For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
<sup>8</sup> but given to hospitality, as lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;
<sup>9</sup> holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.
<sup>10</sup> For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,
<sup>11</sup> whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
<sup>12</sup> One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.
<sup>13</sup> This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
<sup>14</sup> not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
<sup>15</sup> To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
<sup>16</sup> They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
## Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:
<sup>2</sup> that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:
<sup>3</sup> that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
<sup>4</sup> that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
<sup>5</sup> to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:
<sup>6</sup> the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:
<sup>7</sup> in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity,
<sup>8</sup> sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.
<sup>9</sup> Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them in all things; not gainsaying;
<sup>10</sup> not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
<sup>11</sup> For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
<sup>12</sup> instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;
<sup>13</sup> looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
<sup>14</sup> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
<sup>15</sup> These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
## Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
<sup>2</sup> to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
<sup>3</sup> For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
<sup>4</sup> But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,
<sup>5</sup> not by works done in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
<sup>6</sup> which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
<sup>7</sup> that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
<sup>8</sup> Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
<sup>9</sup> but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
<sup>10</sup> A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;
<sup>11</sup> knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
<sup>12</sup> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
<sup>13</sup> Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
<sup>14</sup> And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
<sup>15</sup> All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
