001:001 ¶  In G1722 the beginning G0746 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the Word G3056, and G2532 the Word G3056 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G4314 God G2316, and G2532 the Word G3056 was G2258 (ImpfInd) God G2316.
001:002 The same G3778 was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the beginning G0746 with G4314 God G2316.
001:003 All things G3956 were made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) by G1223 him G0846; and G2532 without G5565 him G0846 was G1096 not G3761 any thing G1520 made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) that G3739 was made G1096 (Perf2ActInd).
001:004 In G1722 him G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) life G2222; and G2532 the life G2222 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the light G5457 of men G0444.
001:005 And G2532 the light G5457 shineth G5316 (PresActInd) in G1722 darkness G4653; and G2532 the darkness G4653 comprehended G2638 (Aor2ActInd) it G0846 not G3756.
001:006 There was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a man G0444 sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc) from G3844 God G2316, whose G0846 name G3686 [was] John G2491.
001:007 The same G3778 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) for G1519 a witness G3141, to G2443 bear witness G3140 (AorActSubj) of G4012 the Light G5457, that G2443 all G3956 [men] through G1223 him G0846 might believe G4100 (AorActSubj).
001:008 He was G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3756 that G1565 Light G5457, but G0235 [was sent] to G2443 bear witness G3140 (AorActSubj) of G4012 that Light G5457.
001:009 [That] was G2258 (ImpfInd) the true G0228 Light G5457, which G3739 lighteth G5461 (PresActInd) every man G3956 G0444 that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 the world G2889.
001:010 He was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the world G2889, and G2532 the world G2889 was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) by G1223 him G0846, and G2532 the world G2889 knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 not G3756.
001:011 He came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 his own G2398, and G2532 his own G2398 received G3880 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 not G3756.
001:012 But G1161 as many as G3745 received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, to them G0846 gave he G1325 (AorActInd) power G1849 to become G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) the sons G5043 of God G2316, [even] to them that believe G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 his G0846 name G3686:
001:013 Which G3739 were born G1080 (AorPasInd), not G3756 of G1537 blood G0129, nor G3761 of G1537 the will G2307 of the flesh G4561, nor G3761 of G1537 the will G2307 of man G0435, but G0235 of G1537 God G2316.
001:014 And G2532 the Word G3056 was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) flesh G4561, and G2532 dwelt G4637 (AorActInd) among G1722 us G2254, (and G2532 we beheld G2300 (AorMidDepInd) his G0846 glory G1391, the glory G1391 as G5613 of the only begotten G3439 of G3844 the Father G3962,) full G4134 of grace G5485 and G2532 truth G0225.
001:015 John G2491 bare witness G3140 (PresActInd) of G4012 him G0846, and G2532 cried G2896 (Perf2ActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This G3778 was he G2258 (ImpfInd) of whom G3739 I spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd), He that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) after G3694 me G3450 is preferred G1096 (Perf2ActInd) before G1715 me G3450: for G3754 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) before G4413 me G3450.
001:016 And G2532 of G1537 his G0846 fulness G4138 have G2983 all G3956 we G2249 received G2983 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 grace G5485 for G0473 grace G5485.
001:017 For G3754 the law G3551 was given G1325 (AorPasInd) by G1223 Moses G3475, [but] grace G5485 and G2532 truth G0225 came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) by G1223 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
001:018 No man G3762 hath seen G3708 (PerfActInd) God G2316 at any time G4455; the only begotten G3439 Son G5207, which G3588 is G5607 (PresPtc) in G1519 the bosom G2859 of the Father G3962, he G1565 hath declared G1834 (AorMidDepInd) [him].
001:019 And G2532 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the record G3141 of John G2491, when G3753 the Jews G2453 sent G0649 (AorActInd) priests G2409 and G2532 Levites G3019 from G1537 Jerusalem G2414 to G2443 ask G2065 (AorActSubj) him G0846, Who G5101 art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771?
001:020 And G2532 he confessed G3670 (AorActInd), and G2532 denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) not G3756; but G2532 confessed G3670 (AorActInd), G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 the Christ G5547.
001:021 And G2532 they asked G2065 (AorActInd) him G0846, What G5101 then G3767? Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 Elias G2243? And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd), I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756. Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 that prophet G4396? And G2532 he answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), No G3756.
001:022 Then G3767 said they G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Who G5101 art thou G1488 (PresInd)? that G2443 we may give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) an answer G0612 to them that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) us G2248. What G5101 sayest thou G3004 (PresActInd) of G4012 thyself G4572?
001:023 He said G5346 (ImpfInd), I G1473 [am] the voice G5456 of one crying G0994 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the wilderness G2048, Make straight G2116 (AorActImpr) the way G3598 of the Lord G2962, as G2531 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the prophet G4396 Esaias G2268.
001:024 And G2532 they which G3588 were sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc) were G2258 (ImpfInd) of G1537 the Pharisees G5330.
001:025 And G2532 they asked G2065 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Why G5101 baptizest thou G0907 (PresActInd) then G3767, if G1487 thou G4771 be G1488 (PresInd) not G3756 that Christ G5547, nor G3777 Elias G2243, neither G3777 that prophet G4396?
001:026 John G2491 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I G1473 baptize G0907 (PresActInd) with G1722 water G5204: but G1161 there standeth one G2476 (ImpfActInd/PerfActInd) among G3319 you G5216, whom G3739 ye G5210 know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756;
001:027 He G0846 it is G2076 (PresInd), who G3739 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) after G3694 me G3450 is preferred G1096 (Perf2ActInd) before G1715 me G3450, whose G3739 G0846 shoe’s G5266 latchet G2438 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G0514 to G2443 unloose G3089 (AorActSubj).
001:028 These things G5023 were done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 Bethabara G0962 beyond G4008 Jordan G2446, where G3699 John G2491 was G2258 (ImpfInd) baptizing G0907 (PresActPtc).
001:029 The next day G1887 John G2491 seeth G0991 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) unto G4314 him G0846, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd), Behold G2396 the Lamb G0286 of God G2316, which G3588 taketh away G0142 (PresActPtc) the sin G0266 of the world G2889.
001:030 This G3778 is he G2076 (PresInd) of G4012 whom G3739 I G1473 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), After G3694 me G3450 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) a man G0435 which G3739 is preferred G1096 (Perf2ActInd) before G1715 me G3450: for G3754 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) before G4413 me G3450.
001:031 And I G2504 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) him G0846 not G3756: but G0235 that G2443 he should be made manifest G5319 (AorPasSubj) to Israel G2474, therefore G1223 G5124 am G2064 I G1473 come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) baptizing G0907 (PresActPtc) with G1722 water G5204.
001:032 And G2532 John G2491 bare record G3140 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 I saw G2300 (PerfMidPasDepInd) the Spirit G4151 descending G2597 (PresActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772 like G5616 a dove G4058, and G2532 it abode G3306 (AorActInd) upon G1909 him G0846.
001:033 And I G2504 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) him G0846 not G3756: but G0235 he that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165 to baptize G0907 (PresActInf) with G1722 water G5204, the same G1565 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto me G3427, Upon G1909 whom G3739 G0302 thou shalt see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) the Spirit G4151 descending G2597 (PresActPtc), and G2532 remaining G3306 (PresActPtc) on G1909 him G0846, the same G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) he which baptizeth G0907 (PresActPtc) with G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
001:034 And I G2504 saw G3708 (PerfActInd), and G2532 bare record G3140 (PerfActInd) that G3754 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316.
001:035 Again G3825 the next day after G1887 John G2491 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd), and G2532 two G1417 of G1537 his G0846 disciples G3101;
001:036 And G2532 looking upon G1689 (AorActPtc) Jesus G2424 as he walked G4043 (PresActPtc), he saith G3004 (PresActInd), Behold G2396 the Lamb G0286 of God G2316!
001:037 And G2532 the two G1417 disciples G3101 heard G0191 (AorActInd) him G0846 speak G2980 (PresActPtc), and G2532 they followed G0190 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424.
001:038 Then G1161 Jesus G2424 turned G4762 (Aor2PasPtc), and G2532 saw G2300 (AorMidDepPtc) them G0846 following G0190 (PresActPtc), and saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, What G5101 seek ye G2212 (PresActInd)? G1161 They said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Rabbi G4461, (which G3739 is to say G3004 (PresPasInd), being interpreted G2059 (PresPasPtc), Master G1320,) where G4226 dwellest thou G3306 (PresActInd)?
001:039 He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Come G2064 (PresMidPasDepImpr) and G2532 see G1492 (Aor2ActImpr). They came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) where G4226 he dwelt G3306 (PresActInd), and G2532 abode G3306 (AorActInd) with G3844 him G0846 that G1565 day G2250: for G1161 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5613 the tenth G1182 hour G5610.
001:040 One G1520 of G1537 the two G1417 which G3588 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) G3844 John G2491 [speak], and G2532 followed G0190 (AorActPtc) him G0846, was G2258 (ImpfInd) Andrew G0406, Simon G4613 Peter’s G4074 brother G0080.
001:041 He G3778 first G4413 findeth G2147 (PresActInd) his own G2398 brother G0080 Simon G4613, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, We have found G2147 (PerfActInd) the Messias G3323, which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd), being interpreted G3177 (PresPasPtc), the Christ G5547.
001:042 And G2532 he brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 to G4314 Jesus G2424. And G1161 when Jesus G2424 beheld G1689 (AorActPtc) him G0846, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) Simon G4613 the son G5207 of Jona G2495: thou G4771 shalt be called G2564 (FutPasInd) Cephas G2786, which G3739 is by interpretation G2059 (PresPasInd), A stone G4074.
001:043 The day following G1887 Jesus G2424 would G2309 (AorActInd) go forth G1831 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 Galilee G1056, and G2532 findeth G2147 (PresActInd) Philip G5376, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
001:044 Now G1161 Philip G5376 was G2258 (ImpfInd) of G0575 Bethsaida G0966, the city G4172 of G1537 Andrew G0406 and G2532 Peter G4074.
001:045 Philip G5376 findeth G2147 (PresActInd) Nathanael G3482, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, We have found G2147 (PerfActInd) him, of whom G3739 Moses G3475 in G1722 the law G3551, and G2532 the prophets G4396, did write G1125 (AorActInd), Jesus G2424 of G0575 Nazareth G3478, the son G5207 of Joseph G2501.
001:046 And G2532 Nathanael G3482 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) there any G5100 good thing G0018 come G1511 (PresInf) out of G1537 Nazareth G3478? Philip G5376 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) and G2532 see G1492 (AorActImpr).
001:047 Jesus G2424 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) Nathanael G3482 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G4314 him G0846, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) of G4012 him G0846, Behold G2396 an Israelite G2475 indeed G0230, in G1722 whom G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 guile G1388!
001:048 Nathanael G3482 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Whence G4159 knowest thou G1097 (PresActInd) me G3165? Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Before G4253 that Philip G5376 called G5455 (AorActInf) thee G4571, when thou wast G5607 (PresPtc) under G5259 the fig tree G4808, I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571.
001:049 Nathanael G3482 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Rabbi G4461, thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316; thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) the King G0935 of Israel G2474.
001:050 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Because G3754 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto thee G4671, I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571 under G5270 the fig tree G4808, believest thou G4100 (PresActInd)? thou shalt see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) greater things G3187 than these G5130.
001:051 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Hereafter G0737 G0575 ye shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) heaven G3772 open G0455 (Perf2PasPtc), and G2532 the angels G0032 of God G2316 ascending G0305 (PresActPtc) and G2532 descending G2597 (PresActPtc) upon G1909 the Son G5207 of man G0444.
002:001 ¶  And G2532 the third G5154 day G2250 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a marriage G1062 in G1722 Cana G2580 of Galilee G1056; and G2532 the mother G3384 of Jesus G2424 was G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563:
002:002 And G1161 both G2532 Jesus G2424 was called G2564 (AorPasInd), and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101, to G1519 the marriage G1062.
002:003 And G2532 when they wanted G5302 (AorActPtc) wine G3631, the mother G3384 of Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, They have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 wine G3631.
002:004 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Woman G1135, what G5101 have I G1698 to do with G2532 thee G4671? mine G3450 hour G5610 is G2240 not yet G3768 come G2240 (PresActInd).
002:005 His G0846 mother G3384 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the servants G1249, Whatsoever G3748 G0302 he saith G3004 (PresActSubj) unto you G5213, do G4160 (AorActImpr) [it].
002:006 And G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) set G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc) there G1563 six G1803 waterpots G5201 of stone G3035, after G2596 the manner of the purifying G2512 of the Jews G2453, containing G5562 (PresActPtc) two G1417 or G2228 three G5140 firkins G3355 apiece G0303.
002:007 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Fill G1072 (AorActImpr) the waterpots G5201 with water G5204. And G2532 they filled G1072 them G0846 up G1072 (AorActInd) to G2193 the brim G0507.
002:008 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Draw out G0501 (AorActImpr) now G3568, and G2532 bear G5342 (PresActImpr) unto the governor of the feast G0755. And G2532 they bare G5342 (AorActInd) [it].
002:009 G1161 When G5613 the ruler of the feast G0755 had tasted G1089 (AorMidDepInd) the water G5204 that was made G1096 (PerfPasPtc) wine G3631, and G2532 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756 whence G4159 it was G2076 (PresInd): (but G1161 the servants G1249 which G3588 drew G0501 (PerfActPtc) the water G5204 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd);) the governor of the feast G0755 called G5455 (PresActInd) the bridegroom G3566,
002:010 And G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Every G3956 man G0444 at the beginning G4412 doth set forth G5087 (PresActInd) good G2570 wine G3631; and G2532 when G3752 men have well drunk G3184 (AorPasSubj), then G5119 that which is worse G1640: [but] thou G4771 hast kept G5083 (PerfActInd) the good G2570 wine G3631 until G2193 now G0737.
002:011 This G5026 beginning G0746 of miracles G4592 did G4160 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 in G1722 Cana G2580 of Galilee G1056, and G2532 manifested forth G5319 (AorActInd) his G0846 glory G1391; and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 believed G4100 (AorActInd) on G1519 him G0846.
002:012 After G3326 this G5124 he went down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Capernaum G2584, he G0846, and G2532 his G0846 mother G3384, and G2532 his G0846 brethren G0080, and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101: and G2532 they continued G3306 (AorActInd) there G1563 not G3756 many G4183 days G2250.
002:013 And G2532 the Jews G2453 ’ passover G3957 was G2258 (ImpfInd) at hand G1451, and G2532 Jesus G2424 went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414,
002:014 And G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the temple G2411 those that sold G4453 (PresActPtc) oxen G1016 and G2532 sheep G4263 and G2532 doves G4058, and G2532 the changers of money G2773 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc):
002:015 And G2532 when he had made G4160 (AorActPtc) a scourge G5416 of G1537 small cords G4979, he drove G1544 (Aor2ActInd) them all G3956 out of G1537 the temple G2411, and G5037 the sheep G4263, and G2532 the oxen G1016; and G2532 poured out G1632 (AorActInd) the changers G2855 ’ money G2772, and G2532 overthrew G0390 (AorActInd) the tables G5132;
002:016 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them that sold G4453 (PresActPtc) doves G4058, Take G0142 (AorActImpr) these things G5023 hence G1782; make G4160 (PresActImpr) not G3361 my G3450 Father’s G3962 house G3624 an house G3624 of merchandise G1712.
002:017 And G1161 his G0846 disciples G3101 remembered G3415 (AorPasInd) that G3754 it was G2076 (PresInd) written G1125 (PerfPasPtc), The zeal G2205 of thine G4675 house G3624 hath eaten G2719 me G3165 up G2719 (Aor2ActInd).
002:018 Then G3767 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) the Jews G2453 and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, What G5101 sign G4592 shewest thou G1166 (PresActInd) unto us G2254, seeing that G3754 thou doest G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023?
002:019 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Destroy G3089 (AorActImpr) this G5126 temple G3485, and G2532 in G1722 three G5140 days G2250 I will raise G1453 it G0846 up G1453 (FutActInd).
002:020 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the Jews G2453, Forty G5062 and G2532 six G1803 years G2094 was G3618 this G3778 temple G3485 in building G3618 (AorPasInd), and G2532 wilt G1453 thou G4771 rear G1453 it G0846 up G1453 (FutActInd) in G1722 three G5140 days G2250?
002:021 But G1161 he G1565 spake G3004 (ImpfActInd) of G4012 the temple G3485 of his G0846 body G4983.
002:022 When G3753 therefore G3767 he was risen G1453 (AorPasInd) from G1537 the dead G3498, his G0846 disciples G3101 remembered G3415 (AorPasInd) that G3754 he had said G3004 (ImpfActInd) this G5124 unto them G0846; and G2532 they believed G4100 (AorActInd) the scripture G1124, and G2532 the word G3056 which G3739 Jesus G2424 had said G2036 (Aor2ActInd).
002:023 Now G1161 when G5613 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 Jerusalem G2414 at G1722 the passover G3957, in G1722 the feast G1859 [day], many G4183 believed G4100 (AorActInd) in G1519 his G0846 name G3686, when they saw G2334 (PresActPtc) the miracles G0846 G4592 which G3739 he did G4160 (ImpfActInd).
002:024 But G1161 Jesus G2424 G0846 did G4100 not G3756 commit G4100 (ImpfActInd) himself G1438 unto them G0846, because G1223 he G0846 knew G1097 (PresActInf) all G3956 [men],
002:025 And G2532 G3754 needed G5532 G2192 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 that G2443 any G5100 should testify G3140 (AorActSubj) of G4012 man G0444: for G1063 he G0846 knew G1097 (ImpfActInd) what G5101 was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 man G0444.
003:001 ¶  G1161 There was G2258 (ImpfInd) a man G0444 of G1537 the Pharisees G5330, named G3686 G0846 Nicodemus G3530, a ruler G0758 of the Jews G2453:
003:002 The same G3778 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 Jesus G2424 by night G3571, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Rabbi G4461, we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 thou art G2064 a teacher G1320 come G2064 (Perf2ActInd) from G0575 God G2316: for G1063 no man G3762 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) do G4160 (PresActInf) these G5023 miracles G4592 that G3739 thou G4771 doest G4160 (PresActInd), except G3362 God G2316 be G5600 (PresSubj) with G3326 him G0846.
003:003 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, Except G3362 a man G5100 be born G1080 (AorPasSubj) again G0509, he cannot G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) G3756 see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
003:004 Nicodemus G3530 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, How G4459 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) a man G0444 be born G1080 (AorPasInf) when he is G5607 (PresPtc) old G1088? can G3361 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) he enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) the second time G1208 into G1519 his G0846 mother’s G3384 womb G2836, and G2532 be born G1080 (AorPasInf)?
003:005 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, Except G3362 a man G5100 be born G1080 (AorPasSubj) of G1537 water G5204 and G2532 [of] the Spirit G4151, he cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
003:006 That which is born G1080 (PerfPasPtc) of G1537 the flesh G4561 is G2076 (PresInd) flesh G4561; and G2532 that which is born G1080 (PerfPasPtc) of G1537 the Spirit G4151 is G2076 (PresInd) spirit G4151.
003:007 Marvel G2296 (AorActSubj) not G3361 that G3754 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto thee G4671, Ye G5209 must G1163 (PresInd) be born G1080 (AorPasInf) again G0509.
003:008 The wind G4151 bloweth G4154 (PresActInd) where G3699 it listeth G2309 (PresActInd), and G2532 thou hearest G0191 (PresActInd) the sound G5456 thereof G0846, but G0235 canst G1492 not G3756 tell G1492 (PerfActInd) whence G4159 it cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 whither G4226 it goeth G5217 (PresActInd): so G3779 is G2076 (PresInd) every one G3956 that is born G1080 (PerfPasPtc) of G1537 the Spirit G4151.
003:009 Nicodemus G3530 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, How G4459 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) these things G5023 be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf)?
003:010 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 a master G1320 of Israel G2474, and G2532 knowest G1097 (PresActInd) not G3756 these things G5023?
003:011 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, We speak G2980 (PresActInd) that G3754 G3739 we do know G1492 (PerfActInd), and G2532 testify G3140 (PresActInd) that G3739 we have seen G3708 (PerfActInd); and G2532 ye receive G2983 (PresActInd) not G3756 our G2257 witness G3141.
003:012 If G1487 I have told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) you G5213 earthly things G1919, and G2532 ye believe G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756, how G4459 shall ye believe G4100 (FutActInd), if G1437 I tell G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) you G5213 [of] heavenly things G2032?
003:013 And G2532 no man G3762 hath ascended up G0305 (PerfActInd) to G1519 heaven G3772, but G1508 he that came down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772, [even] the Son G5207 of man G0444 which G3588 is G5607 (PresPtc) in G1722 heaven G3772.
003:014 And G2532 as G2531 Moses G3475 lifted up G5312 (AorActInd) the serpent G3789 in G1722 the wilderness G2048, even so G3779 must G1163 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444 be lifted up G5312 (AorPasInf):
003:015 That G3363 whosoever G3956 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) in G1519 him G0846 should G0622 not G3363 perish G0622 (Aor2MidSubj), but G0235 have G2192 (PresActSubj) eternal G0166 life G2222.
003:016 For G1063 God G2316 so G3779 loved G0025 (AorActInd) the world G2889, that G5620 he gave G1325 (AorActInd) his G0846 only begotten G3439 Son G5207, that G2443 whosoever G3956 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) in G1519 him G0846 should G0622 not G3361 perish G0622 (Aor2MidSubj), but G0235 have G2192 (PresActSubj) everlasting G0166 life G2222.
003:017 For G1063 God G2316 sent G0649 (AorActInd) not G3756 his G0846 Son G5207 into G1519 the world G2889 to G2443 condemn G2919 (PresActSubj) the world G2889; but G0235 that G2443 the world G2889 through G1223 him G0846 might be saved G4982 (AorPasSubj).
003:018 He that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 him G0846 is G2919 not G3756 condemned G2919 (PresPasInd): but G1161 he that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) not G3361 is condemned G2919 (PerfPasInd) already G2235, because G3754 he hath G4100 not G3361 believed G4100 (PerfActInd) in G1519 the name G3686 of the only begotten G3439 Son G5207 of God G2316.
003:019 And G1161 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the condemnation G2920, that G3754 light G5457 is come G2064 (Perf2ActInd) into G1519 the world G2889, and G2532 men G0444 loved G0025 (AorActInd) darkness G4655 rather G3123 than G2228 light G5457, because G1063 their G0846 deeds G2041 were G2258 (ImpfInd) evil G4190.
003:020 For G1063 every one G3956 that doeth G4238 (PresActPtc) evil G5337 hateth G3404 (PresActInd) the light G5457, neither G2532 G3756 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 the light G5457, lest G3363 his G0846 deeds G2041 should be reproved G1651 (AorPasSubj).
003:021 But G1161 he that doeth G4160 (PresActPtc) truth G0225 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 the light G5457, that G2443 his G0846 deeds G2041 may be made manifest G5319 (AorPasSubj), that G3754 they are G2076 (PresInd) wrought G2038 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 God G2316.
003:022 After G3326 these things G5023 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 into G1519 the land G1093 of Judaea G2449; and G2532 there G1563 he tarried G1304 (ImpfActInd) with G3326 them G0846, and G2532 baptized G0907 (ImpfActInd).
003:023 And G1161 John G2491 also G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) baptizing G0907 (PresActPtc) in G1722 Aenon G0137 near G1451 to Salim G4530, because G3754 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) much G4183 water G5204 there G1563: and G2532 they came G3854 (ImpfMidDepInd), and G2532 were baptized G0907 (ImpfPasInd).
003:024 For G1063 John G2491 was G2258 (ImpfInd) not yet G3768 cast G0906 (PerfPasPtc) into G1519 prison G5438.
003:025 Then G3767 there arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a question G2214 between G3326 [some] of G1537 John’s G2491 disciples G3101 and the Jews G2453 about G4012 purifying G2512.
003:026 And G2532 they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 John G2491, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Rabbi G4461, he G3739 that was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 thee G4675 beyond G4008 Jordan G2446, to whom G3739 thou G4771 barest witness G3140 (PerfActInd), behold G2396, the same G3778 baptizeth G0907 (PresActInd), and G2532 all G3956 [men] come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 him G0846.
003:027 John G2491 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), A man G0444 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) G3756 receive G2983 (PresActInf) nothing G3762, except G3362 it be G5600 (PresSubj) given G1325 (PerfPasPtc) him G0846 from G1537 heaven G3772.
003:028 Ye G5210 yourselves G0846 bear G3140 me G3427 witness G3140 (PresActInd), that G3754 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 the Christ G5547, but G0235 that G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc) before G1715 him G1565.
003:029 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) the bride G3565 is G2076 (PresInd) the bridegroom G3566: but G1161 the friend G5384 of the bridegroom G3566, which G3588 standeth G2476 (PerfActPtc) and G2532 heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) him G0846, rejoiceth G5463 (PresActInd) greatly G5479 because G1223 of the bridegroom’s G3566 voice G5456: this G3778 my G1699 joy G5479 therefore G3767 is fulfilled G4137 (PerfPasInd).
003:030 He G1565 must G1163 (PresInd) increase G0837 (PresActInf), but G1161 I G1691 [must] decrease G1642 (PresPasInf).
003:031 He that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) from above G0509 is G2076 (PresInd) above G1883 all G3956: he that is G5607 (PresPtc) of G1537 the earth G1093 is G2076 (PresInd) earthly G1537 G1093, and G2532 speaketh G2980 (PresActInd) of G1537 the earth G1093: he that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) above G1883 all G3956.
003:032 And G2532 what G3739 he hath seen G3708 (PerfActInd) and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActInd), that G5124 he testifieth G3140 (PresActInd); and G2532 no man G3762 receiveth G2983 (PresActInd) his G0846 testimony G3141.
003:033 He that hath received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) his G0846 testimony G3141 hath set to his seal G4972 (AorActInd) that G3754 God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0227.
003:034 For G1063 he whom G3739 God G2316 hath sent G0649 (AorActInd) speaketh G2980 (PresActInd) the words G4487 of God G2316: for G1063 God G2316 giveth G1325 (PresActInd) not G3756 the Spirit G4151 by G1537 measure G3358 [unto him].
003:035 The Father G3962 loveth G0025 (PresActInd) the Son G5207, and G2532 hath given G1325 (PerfActInd) all things G3956 into G1722 his G0846 hand G5495.
003:036 He that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 the Son G5207 hath G2192 (PresActInd) everlasting G0166 life G2222: and G1161 he that believeth not G0544 (PresActPtc) the Son G5207 shall G3700 not G3756 see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) life G2222; but G0235 the wrath G3709 of God G2316 abideth G3306 (PresActInd) on G1909 him G0846.
004:001 ¶  When G5613 therefore G3767 the Lord G2962 knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) how G3754 the Pharisees G5330 had heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G3754 Jesus G2424 made G4160 (PresActInd) and G2532 baptized G0907 (PresActInd) more G4119 disciples G3101 than G2228 John G2491,
004:002 (Though G2544 Jesus G2424 himself G0846 baptized G0907 (ImpfActInd) not G3756, but G0235 his G0846 disciples G3101,)
004:003 He left G0863 (AorActInd) Judaea G2449, and G2532 departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825 into G1519 Galilee G1056.
004:004 And G1161 he must needs G1163 (ImpfInd) go G1330 (PresMidPasDepInf) through G1223 Samaria G4540.
004:005 Then G3767 cometh he G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G1519 a city G4172 of Samaria G4540, which is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Sychar G4965, near G4139 to the parcel of ground G5564 that G3739 Jacob G2384 gave G1325 (AorActInd) to his G0846 son G5207 Joseph G2501.
004:006 Now G1161 Jacob’s G2384 well G4077 was G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563. Jesus G2424 therefore G3767, being wearied G2872 (PerfActPtc) with G1537 [his] journey G3597, sat G2516 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) thus G3779 on G1909 the well G4077: [and] it was G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5616 the sixth G1623 hour G5610.
004:007 There cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) a woman G1135 of G1537 Samaria G4540 to draw G0501 (AorActInf) water G5204: Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427 to drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf).
004:008 (For G1063 his G0846 disciples G3101 were gone away G0565 (PlupfActInd) unto G1519 the city G4172 to G2443 buy G0059 (AorActSubj) meat G5160.)
004:009 Then G3767 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the woman G1135 of Samaria G4542 unto him G0846, How is it that G4459 thou G4771, being G5607 (PresPtc) a Jew G2453, askest G0154 (PresActInd) drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf) of G3844 me G1700, which am G5607 (PresPtc) a woman G1135 of Samaria G4542? for G1063 the Jews G2453 have G4798 no G3756 dealings G4798 (PresMidPasDepInd) with the Samaritans G4541.
004:010 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, If G1487 thou knewest G1492 (PlupfActInd) the gift G1431 of God G2316, and G2532 who G5101 it is G2076 (PresInd) that saith G3004 (PresActPtc) to thee G4671, Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427 to drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf); thou G4771 wouldest G0302 have asked G0154 (AorActInd) of him G0846, and G2532 he would G0302 have given G1325 (AorActInd) thee G4671 living G2198 (PresActPtc) water G5204.
004:011 The woman G1135 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Sir G2962, thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) nothing G3777 to draw with G0502, and G2532 the well G5421 is G2076 (PresInd) deep G0901: from whence G4159 then G3767 hast thou G2192 (PresActInd) that living G2198 (PresActPtc) water G5204?
004:012 G3361 Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 greater G3187 than our G2257 father G3962 Jacob G2384, which G3739 gave G1325 (AorActInd) us G2254 the well G5421, and G2532 drank G4095 (Aor2ActInd) thereof G1537 G0846 himself G0846, and G2532 his G0846 children G5207, and G2532 his G0846 cattle G2353?
004:013 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Whosoever G3956 drinketh G4095 (PresActPtc) of G1537 this G5127 water G5204 shall thirst G1372 (FutActInd) again G3825:
004:014 But G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 drinketh G4095 (Aor2ActSubj) of G1537 the water G5204 that G3739 I G1473 shall give G1325 (FutActInd) him G0846 shall G1372 never G1519 G0165 G3364 thirst G1372 (AorActSubj); but G0235 the water G5204 that G3739 I shall give G1325 (FutActInd) him G0846 shall be G1096 (FutMidDepInd) in G1722 him G0846 a well G4077 of water G5204 springing up G0242 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 everlasting G0166 life G2222.
004:015 The woman G1135 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Sir G2962, give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427 this G5124 water G5204, that G3363 I thirst G1372 (PresActSubj) not G3363, neither G3366 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepSubj) hither G1759 to draw G0501 (PresActInf).
004:016 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Go G5217 (PresActImpr), call G5455 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 husband G0435, and G2532 come G2064 (Aor2ActImpr) hither G1759.
004:017 The woman G1135 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 husband G0435. Jesus G2424 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Thou hast G2036 well G2573 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), G3754 I have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 husband G0435:
004:018 For G1063 thou hast had G2192 (Aor2ActInd) five G4002 husbands G0435; and G2532 he whom G3739 thou G2192 now G3568 hast G2192 (PresActInd) is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 thy G4675 husband G0435: in that G5124 saidst thou G2046 (PerfActInd) truly G0227.
004:019 The woman G1135 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Sir G2962, I perceive G2334 (PresActInd) that G3754 thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) a prophet G4396.
004:020 Our G2257 fathers G3962 worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) in G1722 this G5129 mountain G3735; and G2532 ye G5210 say G3004 (PresActInd), that G3754 in G1722 Jerusalem G2414 is G2076 (PresInd) the place G5117 where G3699 men ought G1163 (PresInd) to worship G4352 (PresActInf).
004:021 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Woman G1135, believe G4100 (AorActImpr) me G3427, the hour G5610 cometh G3754 G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), when G3753 ye shall G4352 neither G3777 in G1722 this G5129 mountain G3735, nor yet G3777 at G1722 Jerusalem G2414, worship G4352 (FutActInd) the Father G3962.
004:022 Ye G5210 worship G4352 (PresActInd) ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G3739: we know G1492 (PerfActInd) what G3739 we G2249 worship G4352 (PresActInd): for G3754 salvation G4991 is G2076 (PresInd) of G1537 the Jews G2453.
004:023 But G0235 the hour G5610 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 now G3568 is G2076 (PresInd), when G3753 the true G0228 worshippers G4353 shall worship G4352 (FutActInd) the Father G3962 in G1722 spirit G4151 and G2532 in truth G0225: for G2532 G1063 the Father G3962 seeketh G2212 (PresActInd) such G5108 to worship G4352 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
004:024 God G2316 [is] a Spirit G4151: and G2532 they that worship G4352 (PresActPtc) him G0846 must G1163 (PresInd) worship G4352 (PresActInf) [him] in G1722 spirit G4151 and G2532 in truth G0225.
004:025 The woman G1135 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, I know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 Messias G3323 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), which G3588 is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Christ G5547: when G3752 he G1565 is come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), he will tell G0312 (FutActInd) us G2254 all things G3956.
004:026 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, I G1473 that speak G2980 (PresActPtc) unto thee G4671 am G1510 (PresInd) [he].
004:027 And G2532 upon G1909 this G5129 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 disciples G3101, and G2532 marvelled G2296 (AorActInd) that G3754 he talked G2980 (ImpfActInd) with G3326 the woman G1135: yet G3305 no man G3762 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 seekest thou G2212 (PresActInd)? or G2228, Why G5101 talkest thou G2980 (PresActInd) with G3326 her G0846?
004:028 The woman G1135 then G3767 left G0863 (AorActInd) her G0846 waterpot G5201, and G2532 went her way G0565 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the city G4172, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) to the men G0444,
004:029 Come G1205 (Impr), see G1492 (Aor2ActImpr) a man G0444, which G3739 told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) me G3427 all things G3956 that ever G3745 I did G4160 (AorActInd): is G2076 (PresInd) not G3385 this G3778 the Christ G5547?
004:030 Then G3767 they went G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the city G4172, and G2532 came G2064 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846.
004:031 G1161 In G1722 the mean G3342 while his disciples G3101 prayed G2065 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G4461, eat G5315 (Aor2ActImpr).
004:032 But G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, I G1473 have G2192 (PresActInd) meat G1035 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) that G3739 ye G5210 know G1492 not G3756 of G1492 (PerfActInd).
004:033 Therefore G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) the disciples G3101 one to another G4314 G0240, Hath G5342 any man G3387 brought G5342 (AorActInd) him G0846 [ought] to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf)?
004:034 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, My G1699 meat G1033 is G2076 (PresInd) to G2443 do G4160 (PresActSubj) the will G2307 of him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165, and G2532 to finish G5048 (AorActSubj) his G0846 work G2041.
004:035 Say G3004 (PresActInd) not G3756 ye G5210, There G3754 are G2076 (PresInd) yet G2089 four months G5072, and G2532 [then] cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) harvest G2326? behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Lift up G1869 (AorActImpr) your G5216 eyes G3788, and G2532 look on G2300 (AorMidDepImpr) the fields G5561; for G3754 they are G1526 (PresInd) white G3022 already G2235 to G4314 harvest G2326.
004:036 And G2532 he that reapeth G2325 (PresActPtc) receiveth G2983 (PresActInd) wages G3408, and G2532 gathereth G4863 (PresActInd) fruit G2590 unto G1519 life G2222 eternal G0166: that G2443 both G2532 he that soweth G4687 (PresActPtc) and G2532 he that reapeth G2325 (PresActPtc) may rejoice G5463 (PresActSubj) together G3674.
004:037 And G1063 herein G1722 G5129 is G2076 (PresInd) that saying G3056 true G0228, G3754 One G0243 soweth G2076 (PresInd) G4687 (PresActPtc), and G2532 another G0243 reapeth G2325 (PresActPtc).
004:038 I G1473 sent G0649 (AorActInd) you G5209 to reap G2325 (PresActInf) that whereon G3739 ye G5210 bestowed G2872 no G3756 labour G2872 (PerfActInd): other men G0243 laboured G2872 (PerfActInd), and G2532 ye G5210 are entered G1525 (Perf2ActInd) into G1519 their G0846 labours G2873.
004:039 And G1161 many G4183 of the Samaritans G4541 of G1537 that G1565 city G4172 believed G4100 (AorActInd) on G1519 him G0846 for G1223 the saying G3056 of the woman G1135, which testified G3140 (PresActPtc), G3754 He told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) me G3427 all G3956 that ever G3745 I did G4160 (AorActInd).
004:040 So G3767 when G5613 the Samaritans G4541 were come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, they besought G2065 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that he would tarry G3306 (AorActInf) with G3844 them G0846: and G2532 he abode G3306 (AorActInd) there G1563 two G1417 days G2250.
004:041 And G2532 many G4183 more G4119 believed G4100 (AorActInd) because G1223 of his own G0846 word G3056;
004:042 And G5037 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto the woman G1135, G3754 Now G3765 we believe G4100 (PresActInd), not G3754 because G1223 of thy G4674 saying G2981: for G1063 we have heard G0191 (Perf2ActInd) [him] ourselves G0846, and G2532 know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) indeed G0230 the Christ G5547, the Saviour G4990 of the world G2889.
004:043 Now G1161 after G3326 two G1417 days G2250 he departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) G1831 (Aor2ActInd) thence G1564, and G2532 went into G1519 Galilee G1056.
004:044 For G1063 Jesus G2424 himself G0846 testified G3140 (AorActInd), that G3754 a prophet G4396 hath G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 honour G5092 in G1722 his own G2398 country G3968.
004:045 Then G3767 when G3753 he was come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Galilee G1056, the Galilaeans G1057 received G1209 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, having seen G3708 (PerfActPtc) all the things G3956 that G3739 he did G4160 (AorActInd) at G1722 Jerusalem G2414 at G1722 the feast G1859: for G1063 they G0846 also G2532 went G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 the feast G1859.
004:046 So G3767 Jesus G2424 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825 into G1519 Cana G2580 of Galilee G1056, where G3699 he made G4160 (AorActInd) the water G5204 wine G3631. And G2532 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a certain G5100 nobleman G0937, whose G3739 son G5207 was sick G0770 (ImpfActInd) at G1722 Capernaum G2584.
004:047 When he G3778 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 Jesus G2424 was come G2240 (PresActInd) out of G1537 Judaea G2449 into G1519 Galilee G1056, he went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, and G2532 besought G2065 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that G2443 he would come down G2597 (Aor2ActSubj), and G2532 heal G2390 (AorMidDepSubj) his G0846 son G5207: for G1063 he was at the point G3195 (ImpfActInd) of death G0599 (PresActInf).
004:048 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto G4314 him G0846, Except G3362 ye see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) signs G4592 and G2532 wonders G5059, ye will G4100 not G3364 believe G4100 (AorActSubj).
004:049 The nobleman G0937 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Sir G2962, come down G2597 (Aor2ActImpr) ere G4250 my G3450 child G3813 die G0599 (Aor2ActInf).
004:050 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Go thy way G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr); thy G4675 son G5207 liveth G2198 (PresActInd). And G2532 the man G0444 believed G4100 (AorActInd) the word G3056 that G3739 Jesus G2424 had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, and G2532 he went his way G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd).
004:051 And G1161 as he G0846 was now G2235 going down G2597 (PresActPtc), his G0846 servants G1401 met G0528 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 told G0518 (AorActInd) [him], saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 Thy G4675 son G3816 liveth G2198 (PresActInd).
004:052 Then G3767 enquired he G4441 (Aor2MidDepInd) of G3844 them G0846 the hour G5610 when G1722 G3739 he began G2192 (Aor2ActInd) to amend G2866. And G2532 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, G3754 Yesterday G5504 at the seventh G1442 hour G5610 the fever G4446 left G0863 (AorActInd) him G0846.
004:053 So G3767 the father G3962 knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 [it was] at G1722 the same G1565 hour G5610, in G1722 the which G3739 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, G3754 Thy G4675 son G5207 liveth G2198 (PresActInd): and G2532 himself G0846 believed G4100 (AorActInd), and G2532 his G0846 whole G3650 house G3614.
004:054 This G5124 [is] again G3825 the second G1208 miracle G4592 [that] Jesus G2424 did G4160 (AorActInd), when he was come out G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) of G1537 Judaea G2449 into G1519 Galilee G1056.
005:001 ¶  After G3326 this G5023 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a feast G1859 of the Jews G2453; and G2532 Jesus G2424 went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414.
005:002 Now G1161 there is G2076 (PresInd) at G1722 Jerusalem G2414 by G1909 the sheep G4262 [market] a pool G2861, which G3588 is called G1951 (PresPasPtc) in the Hebrew tongue G1447 Bethesda G0964, having G2192 (PresActPtc) five G4002 porches G4745.
005:003 In G1722 these G5025 lay G2621 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) a great G4183 multitude G4128 of impotent folk G0770 (PresActPtc), of blind G5185, halt G5560, withered G3584, waiting for G1551 (PresMidPasDepPtc) the moving G2796 of the water G5204.
005:004 For G1063 an angel G0032 went down G2597 (ImpfActInd) at G2596 a certain season G2540 into G1722 the pool G2861, and G2532 troubled G5015 (ImpfActInd) the water G5204: whosoever then G3767 first G4413 after G3326 the troubling G5016 of the water G5204 stepped in G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) was made G1096 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) whole G5199 of G3739 whatsoever G1221 disease G3553 he had G2722 (ImpfPasInd).
005:005 And G1161 a certain G5100 man G0444 was G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563, which had G2192 (PresActPtc) an infirmity G1722 G0769 thirty G5144 and eight G3638 years G2094.
005:006 When Jesus G2424 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G5126 lie G2621 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 knew G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he had been G2192 (PresActInd) now G2235 a long G4183 time G5550 [in that case], he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd) be made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) whole G5199?
005:007 The impotent man G0770 (PresActPtc) answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, Sir G2962, I have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 man G0444, when G3752 the water G5204 is troubled G5015 (AorPasSubj), to G2443 put G0906 (PresActSubj) me G3165 into G1519 the pool G2861: but G1161 while G1722 G3739 I G1473 am coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), another G0243 steppeth down G2597 (PresActInd) before G4253 me G1700.
005:008 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Rise G1453 (AorMidImpr), take up G0142 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 bed G2895, and G2532 walk G4043 (PresActImpr).
005:009 And G2532 immediately G2112 the man G0444 was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) whole G5199, and G2532 took up G0142 (AorActInd) his G0846 bed G2895, and G2532 walked G4043 (ImpfActInd): and G1161 on G1722 the same G1565 day G2250 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the sabbath G4521.
005:010 The Jews G2453 therefore G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him that was cured G2323 (PerfPasPtc), It is G2076 (PresInd) the sabbath day G4521: it is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) for thee G4671 to carry G0142 (AorActInf) [thy] bed G2895.
005:011 He answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, He that made G4160 (AorActPtc) me G3165 whole G5199, the same G1565 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto me G3427, Take up G0142 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 bed G2895, and G2532 walk G4043 (PresActImpr).
005:012 Then G3767 asked they G2065 (AorActInd) him G0846, What G5101 man G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) that which G3588 said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) unto thee G4671, Take up G0142 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 bed G2895, and G2532 walk G4043 (PresActImpr)?
005:013 And G1161 he that was healed G2390 (AorPasPtc) wist G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756 who G5101 it was G2076 (PresInd): for G1063 Jesus G2424 had conveyed himself away G1593 (AorActInd), a multitude G3793 being G5607 (PresPtc) in G1722 [that] place G5117.
005:014 Afterward G3326 G5023 Jesus G2424 findeth G2147 (PresActInd) him G0846 in G1722 the temple G2411, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Behold G2396, thou art made G1096 (Perf2ActInd) whole G5199: sin G0264 (PresActImpr) no more G3371, lest G3363 a worse thing G5501 G5100 come G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) unto thee G4671.
005:015 The man G0444 departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 told G0312 (AorActInd) the Jews G2453 that G3754 it was G2076 (PresInd) Jesus G2424, which G3588 had made G4160 (AorActPtc) him G0846 whole G5199.
005:016 And G2532 therefore G1223 G5124 did G1377 the Jews G2453 persecute G1377 (ImpfActInd) Jesus G2424, and G2532 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to slay G0615 (AorActInf) him G0846, because G3754 he had done G4160 (ImpfActInd) these things G5023 on G1722 the sabbath day G4521.
005:017 But G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, My G3450 Father G3962 worketh G2038 (PresMidPasDepInd) hitherto G2193 G0737, and I G2504 work G2038 (PresMidPasDepInd).
005:018 Therefore G1223 G5124 G3767 the Jews G2453 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) the more G3123 to kill G0615 (AorActInf) him G0846, because G3754 he G3089 not G3756 only G3440 had broken G3089 (ImpfActInd) the sabbath G4521, but G0235 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) also G2532 that God G2316 was his G2398 Father G3962, making G4160 (PresActPtc) himself G1438 equal G2470 with God G2316.
005:019 Then G3767 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) Jesus G2424 and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, The Son G5207 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) G3756 do G4160 (PresActInf) nothing G3762 of G0575 himself G1438, but G3362 what G5100 he seeth G0991 (PresActSubj) the Father G3962 do G4160 (PresActPtc): for G1063 what things soever G3739 G0302 he G1565 doeth G4160 (PresActSubj), these G5023 also G2532 doeth G4160 (PresActInd) the Son G5207 likewise G3668.
005:020 For G1063 the Father G3962 loveth G5368 (PresActInd) the Son G5207, and G2532 sheweth G1166 (PresActInd) him G0846 all things G3956 that G3739 himself G0846 doeth G4160 (PresActInd): and G2532 he will shew G1166 (FutActInd) him G0846 greater G3187 works G2041 than G3187 these G5130, that G2443 ye G5210 may marvel G2296 (PresActSubj).
005:021 For G1063 as G5618 the Father G3962 raiseth up G1453 (PresActInd) the dead G3498, and G2532 quickeneth G2227 (PresActInd) [them]; even G2532 so G3779 the Son G5207 quickeneth G2227 (PresActInd) whom G3739 he will G2309 (PresActInd).
005:022 For G1063 G3761 the Father G3962 judgeth G2919 (PresActInd) no man G3762, but G0235 hath committed G1325 (PerfActInd) all G3956 judgment G2920 unto the Son G5207:
005:023 That G2443 all G3956 [men] should honour G5091 (PresActSubj) the Son G5207, even as G2531 they honour G5091 (PresActInd) the Father G3962. He that honoureth G5091 (PresActPtc) not G3361 the Son G5207 honoureth G5091 (PresActInd) not G3756 the Father G3962 which G3588 hath sent G3992 (AorActPtc) him G0846.
005:024 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 He that heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) my G3450 word G3056, and G2532 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165, hath G2192 (PresActInd) everlasting G0166 life G2222, and G2532 shall G2064 not G3756 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) into G1519 condemnation G2920; but G0235 is passed G3327 (PerfActInd) from G1537 death G2288 unto G1519 life G2222.
005:025 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 The hour G5610 is coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 now G3568 is G2076 (PresInd), when G3753 the dead G3498 shall hear G0191 (FutMidDepInd) the voice G5456 of the Son G5207 of God G2316: and G2532 they that hear G0191 (AorActPtc) shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd).
005:026 For G1063 as G5618 the Father G3962 hath G2192 (PresActInd) life G2222 in G1722 himself G1438; so G2532 G3779 hath he given G1325 (AorActInd) to the Son G5207 to have G2192 (PresActInf) life G2222 in G1722 himself G1438;
005:027 And G2532 hath given G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 authority G1849 to execute G4160 (PresActInf) judgment G2920 also G2532, because G3754 he is G2076 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444.
005:028 Marvel G2296 (PresActImpr) not G3361 at this G5124: for G3754 the hour G5610 is coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), in G1722 the which G3739 all G3956 that are in G1722 the graves G3419 shall hear G0191 (FutMidDepInd) his G0846 voice G5456,
005:029 And G2532 shall come forth G1607 (FutMidDepInd); they that have done G4160 (AorActPtc) good G0018, unto G1519 the resurrection G0386 of life G2222; and G1161 they that have done G4238 (AorActPtc) evil G5337, unto G1519 the resurrection G0386 of damnation G2920.
005:030 I G1473 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) of G0575 mine own self G1683 do G4160 (PresActInf) nothing G3756 G3762: as G2531 I hear G0191 (PresActInd), I judge G2919 (PresActInd): and G2532 my G1699 judgment G2920 is G2076 (PresInd) just G1342; because G3754 I seek G2212 (PresActInd) not G3756 mine own G1699 will G2307, but G0235 the will G2307 of the Father G3962 which hath sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
005:031 If G1437 I G1473 bear witness G3140 (PresActSubj) of G4012 myself G1683, my G3450 witness G3141 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 true G0227.
005:032 There is G2076 (PresInd) another G0243 that beareth witness G3140 (PresActPtc) of G4012 me G1700; and G2532 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 the witness G3141 which G3739 he witnesseth G3140 (PresActInd) of G4012 me G1700 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0227.
005:033 Ye G5210 sent G0649 (PerfActInd) unto G4314 John G2491, and G2532 he bare witness G3140 (PerfActInd) unto the truth G0225.
005:034 But G1161 I G1473 receive G2983 (PresActInd) not G3756 testimony G3141 from G3844 man G0444: but G0235 these things G5023 I say G3004 (PresActInd), that G2443 ye G5210 might be saved G4982 (AorPasSubj).
005:035 He G1565 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a burning G2545 (PresPasPtc) and G2532 a shining G5316 (PresActPtc) light G3088: and G1161 ye G5210 were willing G2309 (AorActInd) for G4314 a season G5610 to rejoice G0021 (AorPasDepInf) in G1722 his G0846 light G5457.
005:036 But G1161 I G1473 have G2192 (PresActInd) greater G3187 witness G3141 than [that] of John G2491: for G1063 the works G2041 which G3739 the Father G3962 hath given G1325 (AorActInd) me G3427 to G2443 finish G5048 (AorActSubj) G0846, the same G0846 works G2041 that G3739 I G1473 do G4160 (PresActInd), bear witness G3140 (PresActInd) of G4012 me G1700, that G3754 the Father G3962 hath sent G0649 (PerfActInd) me G3165.
005:037 And G2532 the Father G3962 himself G0846, which hath sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165, hath borne witness G3140 (PerfActInd) of G4012 me G1700. Ye have G0191 neither G3777 heard G0191 (Perf2ActInd) his G0846 voice G5456 at any time G4455, nor G3777 seen G3708 (PerfActInd) his G0846 shape G1491.
005:038 And G2532 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 his G0846 word G3056 abiding G3306 (PresActPtc) in G1722 you G5213: for G3754 whom G3739 G1565 he hath sent G0649 (AorActInd), him G5129 ye G5210 believe G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756.
005:039 Search G2045 (PresActInd) the scriptures G1124; for G3754 in G1722 them G0846 ye G5210 think G1380 (PresActInd) ye have G2192 (PresActInf) eternal G0166 life G2222: and G2532 they G1565 are they G1526 (PresInd) which testify G3140 (PresActPtc) of G4012 me G1700.
005:040 And G2532 ye will G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756 come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) to G4314 me G3165, that G2443 ye might have G2192 (PresActSubj) life G2222.
005:041 I receive G2983 (PresActInd) not G3756 honour G1391 from G3844 men G0444.
005:042 But G0235 I know G1097 (PerfActInd) you G5209, that G3754 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 the love G0026 of God G2316 in G1722 you G1438.
005:043 I am G1473 come G2064 (Perf2ActInd) in G1722 my G3450 Father’s G3962 name G3686, and G2532 ye receive G2983 (PresActInd) me G3165 not G3756: if G1437 another G0243 shall come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 his own G2398 name G3686, him G1565 ye will receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd).
005:044 How G4459 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) ye G5210 believe G4100 (AorActInf), which receive G2983 (PresActPtc) honour G1391 one of another G3844 G0240, and G2532 seek G2212 (PresActInd) not G3756 the honour G1391 that [cometh] from G3844 God G2316 only G3441?
005:045 Do G1380 not G3361 think G1380 (PresActImpr) that G3754 I G1473 will accuse G2723 (FutActInd) you G5216 to G4314 the Father G3962: there is G2076 (PresInd) [one] that accuseth G2723 (PresActPtc) you G5216, [even] Moses G3475, in G1519 whom G3739 ye G5210 trust G1679 (PerfActInd).
005:046 For G1063 G1487 had ye believed G4100 (ImpfActInd) Moses G3475, ye would have believed G4100 (ImpfActInd) G0302 me G1698: for G1063 he G1565 wrote G1125 (AorActInd) of G4012 me G1700.
005:047 But G1161 if G1487 ye believe G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756 his G1565 writings G1121, how G4459 shall ye believe G4100 (FutActInd) my G1699 words G4487?
006:001 ¶  After G3326 these things G5023 Jesus G2424 went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) over G4008 the sea G2281 of Galilee G1056, which is [the sea] of Tiberias G5085.
006:002 And G2532 a great G4183 multitude G3793 followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, because G3754 they saw G3708 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 miracles G4592 which G3739 he did G4160 (ImpfActInd) on G1909 them that were diseased G0770 (PresActPtc).
006:003 And G1161 Jesus G2424 went up G0424 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a mountain G3735, and G2532 there G1563 he sat G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) with G3326 his G0846 disciples G3101.
006:004 And G1161 the passover G3957, a feast G1859 of the Jews G2453, was G2258 (ImpfInd) nigh G1451.
006:005 When Jesus G2424 then G3767 lifted up G1869 (AorActPtc) [his] eyes G3788, and G2532 saw G2300 (AorMidDepPtc) G3754 a great G4183 company G3793 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846, he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto G4314 Philip G5376, Whence G4159 shall we buy G0059 (FutActInd) bread G0740, that G2443 these G3778 may eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj)?
006:006 And G1161 this G5124 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) to prove G3985 (PresActPtc) him G0846: for G1063 he himself G0846 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) what G5101 he would G3195 (ImpfActInd) do G4160 (PresActInf).
006:007 Philip G5376 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, Two hundred G1250 pennyworth G1220 of bread G0740 is G0714 not G3756 sufficient G0714 (PresActInd) for them G0846, that G2443 every one G1538 of them G0846 may take G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) a G5100 little G1024.
006:008 One G1520 of G1537 his G0846 disciples G3101, Andrew G0406, Simon G4613 Peter’s G4074 brother G0080, saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846,
006:009 There is G2076 (PresInd) a G1520 lad G3808 here G5602, which G3739 hath G2192 (PresActInd) five G4002 barley G2916 loaves G0740, and G2532 two G1417 small fishes G3795: but G0235 what G5101 are G2076 (PresInd) they G5023 among G1519 so many G5118?
006:010 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Make G4160 (AorActImpr) the men G0444 sit down G0377 (Aor2ActInf). Now G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) much G4183 grass G5528 in G1722 the place G5117. So G3767 the men G0435 sat down G0377 (Aor2ActInd), in number G0706 about G5616 five thousand G4000.
006:011 And G1161 Jesus G2424 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the loaves G0740; and G2532 when he had given thanks G2168 (AorActPtc), he distributed G1239 (AorActInd) to the disciples G3101, and G1161 the disciples G3101 to them that were set down G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc); and G2532 likewise G3668 of G1537 the fishes G3795 as much as G3745 they would G2309 (ImpfActInd).
006:012 When G1161 G5613 they were filled G1705 (AorPasInd), he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto his G0846 disciples G3101, Gather up G4863 (Aor2ActImpr) the fragments G2801 that remain G4052 (AorActPtc), that nothing G3363 G5100 be lost G0622 (Aor2MidSubj).
006:013 Therefore G3767 they gathered [them] together G4863 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 filled G1072 (AorActInd) twelve G1427 baskets G2894 with the fragments G2801 of G1537 the five G4002 barley G2916 loaves G0740, which G3739 remained over and above G4052 (AorActInd) unto them that had eaten G0977 (PerfActPtc).
006:014 Then G3767 those men G0444, when they had seen G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the miracle G4592 that G3739 Jesus G2424 did G4160 (AorActInd), said G3004 (ImpfActInd), This G3754 G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) of a truth G0230 that prophet G4396 that should come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 the world G2889.
006:015 When Jesus G2424 therefore G3767 perceived G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 they would G3195 (PresActInd) come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInf) and G2532 take G0726 him G0846 by force G0726 (PresActInf), to G2443 make G4160 (AorActSubj) him G0846 a king G0935, he departed G0402 (AorActInd) again G3825 into G1519 a mountain G3735 himself G0846 alone G3441.
006:016 And G1161 when G5613 even G3798 was [now] come G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), his G0846 disciples G3101 went down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1909 the sea G2281,
006:017 And G2532 entered G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 a ship G4143, and went G2064 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) over G4008 the sea G2281 toward G1519 Capernaum G2584. And G2532 it was G1096 (PlupfActInd) now G2235 dark G4653, and G2532 Jesus G2424 was G2064 not G3756 come G2064 (PlupfActInd) to G4314 them G0846.
006:018 And G5037 the sea G2281 arose G1326 (ImpfPasInd) by reason of a great G3173 wind G0417 that blew G4154 (PresActPtc).
006:019 So G3767 when they had rowed G1643 (PerfActPtc) about G5613 five G4002 and twenty G1501 or G2228 thirty G5144 furlongs G4712, they see G2334 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 walking G4043 (PresActPtc) on G1909 the sea G2281, and G2532 drawing G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) nigh G1451 unto the ship G4143: and G2532 they were afraid G5399 (AorPasDepInd).
006:020 But G1161 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, It is G1510 (PresInd) I G1473; be G5399 not G3361 afraid G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr).
006:021 Then G3767 they willingly G2309 (ImpfActInd) received G2983 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846 into G1519 the ship G4143: and G2532 immediately G2112 the ship G4143 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) at G1909 the land G1093 whither G1519 G3739 they went G5217 (ImpfActInd).
006:022 The day following G1887, when the people G3793 which G3588 stood G2476 (PerfActPtc) on the other side G4008 of the sea G2281 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) none G3756 other G0243 boat G4142 there G1563, save G1508 that G1565 one G1520 whereinto G1519 G3739 his G0846 disciples G3101 were entered G1684 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 that G3754 Jesus G2424 went G4897 not G3756 with G4897 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 disciples G3101 into G1519 the boat G4142, but G0235 [that] his G0846 disciples G3101 were gone away G0565 (Aor2ActInd) alone G3441;
006:023 (Howbeit G0235 G1161 there came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) other G0243 boats G4142 from G1537 Tiberias G5085 nigh G1451 unto the place G5117 where G3699 they did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) bread G0740, after that the Lord G2962 had given thanks G2168 (AorActPtc):)
006:024 When G3753 the people G3793 therefore G3767 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 Jesus G2424 was G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 there G1563, neither G3761 his G0846 disciples G3101, they G0846 also G2532 took G1684 (Aor2ActInd) G1519 shipping G4143, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Capernaum G2584, seeking for G2212 (PresActPtc) Jesus G2424.
006:025 And G2532 when they had found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 on the other side G4008 of the sea G2281, they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Rabbi G4461, when G4219 camest thou G1096 (Perf2ActInd) hither G5602?
006:026 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846 and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Ye seek G2212 (PresActInd) me G3165, not G3756 because G3754 ye saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the miracles G4592, but G0235 because G3754 ye did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) of G1537 the loaves G0740, and G2532 were filled G5526 (AorPasInd).
006:027 Labour G2038 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361 for the meat G1035 which G3588 perisheth G0622 (PresMidPtc), but G0235 for that meat G1035 which G3588 endureth G3306 (PresActPtc) unto G1519 everlasting G0166 life G2222, which G3739 the Son G5207 of man G0444 shall give G1325 (FutActInd) unto you G5213: for G1063 him G5126 hath G4972 God G2316 the Father G3962 sealed G4972 (AorActInd).
006:028 Then G3767 said they G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, What G5101 shall we do G4160 (PresActInd) G4160 (PresActSubj), that G2443 we might work G2038 (PresMidPasDepSubj) the works G2041 of God G2316?
006:029 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, This G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) the work G2041 of God G2316, that G2443 ye believe G4100 (AorActSubj) on G1519 him G3739 whom G1565 he hath sent G0649 (AorActInd).
006:030 They said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) therefore G3767 unto him G0846, What G5101 sign G4592 shewest G4160 (PresActInd) thou G4771 then G3767, that G2443 we may see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj), and G2532 believe G4100 (AorActSubj) thee G4671? what G5101 dost thou work G2038 (PresMidPasDepInd)?
006:031 Our G2257 fathers G3962 did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) manna G3131 in G1722 the desert G2048; as G2531 it is G2076 (PresInd) written G1125 (PerfPasPtc), He gave G1325 (AorActInd) them G0846 bread G0740 from G1537 heaven G3772 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf).
006:032 Then G3767 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Moses G3475 gave G1325 (PerfActInd) you G5213 not G3756 that bread G0740 from G1537 heaven G3772; but G0235 my G3450 Father G3962 giveth G1325 (PresActInd) you G5213 the true G0228 bread G0740 from G1537 heaven G3772.
006:033 For G1063 the bread G0740 of God G2316 is he G2076 (PresInd) which G3588 cometh down G2597 (PresActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772, and G2532 giveth G1325 (PresActPtc) life G2222 unto the world G2889.
006:034 Then G3767 said they G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Lord G2962, evermore G3842 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254 this G5126 bread G0740.
006:035 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the bread G0740 of life G2222: he that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G4314 me G3165 shall never G3364 hunger G3983 (AorActSubj); and G2532 he that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 me G1691 shall G1372 never G3364 G4455 thirst G1372 (AorActSubj).
006:036 But G0235 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 ye G3708 also G2532 have seen G3708 (PerfActInd) me G3165, and G2532 believe G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756.
006:037 All G3956 that G3739 the Father G3962 giveth G1325 (PresActInd) me G3427 shall come G2240 (FutActInd) to G4314 me G1691; and G2532 him that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G4314 me G3165 I will G1544 in no wise G3364 cast G1544 (Aor2ActSubj) out G1854.
006:038 For G3754 I came down G2597 (PerfActInd) from G1537 heaven G3772, not G3756 to G2443 do G4160 (PresActSubj) mine own G1699 will G2307, but G0235 the will G2307 of him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
006:039 And G1161 this G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) the Father’s G3962 will G2307 which G3588 hath sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165, that G2443 of all G3956 which G3739 he hath given G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427 I should lose G0622 (AorActSubj) nothing G3361 G1537 G0846, but G0235 should raise G0450 it G0846 up again G0450 (FutActInd) at G1722 the last G2078 day G2250.
006:040 And G1161 this G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) the will G2307 of him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165, that G2443 every one G3956 which G3588 seeth G2334 (PresActPtc) the Son G5207, and G2532 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 him G0846, may have G2192 (PresActSubj) everlasting G0166 life G2222: and G2532 I G1473 will raise G0450 him G0846 up G0450 (FutActInd) at the last G2078 day G2250.
006:041 The Jews G2453 then G3767 murmured G1111 (ImpfActInd) at G4012 him G0846, because G3754 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the bread G0740 which G3588 came down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772.
006:042 And G2532 they said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 this G3778 Jesus G2424, the son G5207 of Joseph G2501, whose G3739 father G3962 and G2532 mother G3384 we G2249 know G1492 (PerfActInd)? how is it G4459 then G3767 that he G3778 saith G3004 (PresActInd), G3754 I came down G2597 (PerfActInd) from G1537 heaven G3772?
006:043 Jesus G2424 therefore G3767 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Murmur G1111 (PresActImpr) not G3361 among G3326 yourselves G0240.
006:044 No man G3762 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) to G4314 me G3165, except G3362 the Father G3962 which G3588 hath sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165 draw G1670 (AorActSubj) him G0846: and G2532 I G1473 will raise G0450 him G0846 up G0450 (FutActInd) at the last G2078 day G2250.
006:045 It is G2076 (PresInd) written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the prophets G4396, And G2532 they shall be G2071 (FutInd) all G3956 taught G1318 of God G2316. Every man G3956 therefore G3767 that hath heard G0191 (AorActPtc), and G2532 hath learned G3129 (Aor2ActPtc) of G3844 the Father G3962, cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 me G3165.
006:046 Not G3756 that G3754 any man G5100 hath seen G3708 (PerfActInd) the Father G3962, save G1508 he which G3588 is G3844 G5607 (PresPtc) of God G2316, he G3778 hath seen G3708 (PerfActInd) the Father G3962.
006:047 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, He that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 me G1691 hath G2192 (PresActInd) everlasting G0166 life G2222.
006:048 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) that bread G0740 of life G2222.
006:049 Your G5216 fathers G3962 did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) manna G3131 in G1722 the wilderness G2048, and G2532 are dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd).
006:050 This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the bread G0740 which G3588 cometh down G2597 (PresActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772, that G3363 a man G5100 may eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) thereof G1537 G0846, and G2532 not G3363 die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj).
006:051 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the living G2198 (PresActPtc) bread G0740 which G3588 came down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772: if G1437 any man G5100 eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) of G1537 this G5127 bread G0740, he shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd) for G1519 ever G0165: and G1161 G2532 the bread G0740 that G3739 I G1473 will give G1325 (FutActInd) is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 flesh G4561, which G3739 I G1473 will give G1325 (FutActInd) for G5228 the life G2222 of the world G2889.
006:052 The Jews G2453 therefore G3767 strove G3164 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) among G4314 themselves G0240, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), How G4459 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) this man G3778 give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) us G2254 [his] flesh G4561 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf)?
006:053 Then G3767 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Except G3362 ye eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) the flesh G4561 of the Son G5207 of man G0444, and G2532 drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj) his G0846 blood G0129, ye have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 life G2222 in G1722 you G1438.
006:054 Whoso eateth G5176 (PresActPtc) my G3450 flesh G4561, and G2532 drinketh G4095 (PresActPtc) my G3450 blood G0129, hath G2192 (PresActInd) eternal G0166 life G2222; and G2532 I G1473 will raise G0450 him G0846 up G0450 (FutActInd) at the last G2078 day G2250.
006:055 For G1063 my G3450 flesh G4561 is G2076 (PresInd) meat G1035 indeed G0230, and G2532 my G3450 blood G0129 is G2076 (PresInd) drink G4213 indeed G0230.
006:056 He that eateth G5176 (PresActPtc) my G3450 flesh G4561, and G2532 drinketh G4095 (PresActPtc) my G3450 blood G0129, dwelleth G3306 (PresActInd) in G1722 me G1698, and I G2504 in G1722 him G0846.
006:057 As G2531 the living G2198 (PresActPtc) Father G3962 hath sent G0649 (AorActInd) me G3165, and I G2504 live G2198 (PresActInd) by G1223 the Father G3962: so G2532 he that eateth G5176 (PresActPtc) me G3165, even he G2548 shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd) by G1223 me G1691.
006:058 This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) that bread G0740 which G3588 came down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772: not G3756 as G2531 your G5216 fathers G3962 did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) manna G3131, and G2532 are dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd): he that eateth G5176 (PresActPtc) of this G5126 bread G0740 shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd) for G1519 ever G0165.
006:059 These things G5023 said he G2036 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the synagogue G4864, as he taught G1321 (PresActPtc) in G1722 Capernaum G2584.
006:060 Many G4183 therefore G3767 of G1537 his G0846 disciples G3101, when they had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [this], said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) an hard G4642 saying G3056; who G5101 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) hear G0191 (PresActInf) it G0846?
006:061 When G1161 Jesus G2424 knew G1492 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 himself G1438 that G3754 his G0846 disciples G3101 murmured G1111 (PresActInd) at G4012 it G5127, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Doth this G5124 offend G4624 (PresActInd) you G5209?
006:062 [What] and G3767 if G1437 ye shall see G2334 (PresActSubj) the Son G5207 of man G0444 ascend up G0305 (PresActPtc) where G3699 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) before G4386?
006:063 It is G2076 (PresInd) the spirit G4151 that quickeneth G2227 (PresActPtc); the flesh G4561 G3756 profiteth G5623 (PresActInd) nothing G3762: the words G4487 that G3739 I G1473 speak G2980 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, [they] are G2076 (PresInd) spirit G4151, and G2532 [they] are G2076 (PresInd) life G2222.
006:064 But G0235 there are G1526 (PresInd) some G5100 of G1537 you G5216 that G3739 believe G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756. For G1063 Jesus G2424 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) from G1537 the beginning G0746 who G5101 they were G1526 (PresInd) that believed G4100 (PresActPtc) not G3361, and G2532 who G5101 should G2076 (PresInd) betray G3860 (FutActPtc) him G0846.
006:065 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Therefore G1223 G5124 said I G2046 (PerfActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 no man G3762 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) unto G4314 me G3165, except G3362 it were G5600 (PresSubj) given G1325 (PerfPasPtc) unto him G0846 of G1537 my G3450 Father G3962.
006:066 From G1537 that G5127 [time] many G4183 of his G0846 disciples G3101 went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) back G1519 G3694, and G2532 walked G4043 (ImpfActInd) no more G3765 with G3326 him G0846.
006:067 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto the twelve G1427, G3361 Will G2309 (PresActInd) ye G5210 also G2532 go away G5217 (PresActInf)?
006:068 Then G3767 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, Lord G2962, to G4314 whom G5101 shall we go G0565 (FutMidDepInd)? thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) the words G4487 of eternal G0166 life G2222.
006:069 And G2532 we G2249 believe G4100 (PerfActInd) and G2532 are sure G1097 (PerfActInd) that G3754 thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) that Christ G5547, the Son G5207 of the living G2198 (PresActPtc) God G2316.
006:070 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, Have G1586 not G3756 I G1473 chosen G1586 (AorMidInd) you G5209 twelve G1427, and G2532 one G1520 of G1537 you G5216 is G2076 (PresInd) a devil G1228?
006:071 G1161 He spake G3004 (ImpfActInd) of Judas G2455 Iscariot G2469 [the son] of Simon G4613: for G1063 he G3778 it was that should G3195 (ImpfActInd) betray G3860 (PresActInf) him G0846, being G5607 (PresPtc) one G1520 of G1537 the twelve G1427.
007:001 ¶  G2532 After G3326 these things G5023 Jesus G2424 walked G4043 (ImpfActInd) in G1722 Galilee G1056: for G1063 he would G2309 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 walk G4043 (PresActInf) in G1722 Jewry G2449, because G3754 the Jews G2453 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to kill G0615 (AorActInf) him G0846.
007:002 Now G1161 the Jews G2453 ’ feast G1859 of tabernacles G4634 was G2258 (ImpfInd) at hand G1451.
007:003 His G0846 brethren G0080 therefore G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Depart G3327 (Aor2ActImpr) hence G1782, and G2532 go G5217 (PresActImpr) into G1519 Judaea G2449, that G2443 thy G4675 disciples G3101 also G2532 may see G2334 (AorActSubj) the works G2041 that G3739 thou G4675 doest G4160 (PresActInd).
007:004 For G1063 [there is] no man G3762 [that] doeth G4160 (PresActInd) any thing G5100 in G1722 secret G2927, and G2532 he himself G0846 seeketh G2212 (PresActInd) to be G1511 (PresInf) known openly G1722 G3954. If G1487 thou do G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023, shew G5319 (AorActImpr) thyself G4572 to the world G2889.
007:005 For G1063 neither G3761 did G4100 his G0846 brethren G0080 believe G4100 (ImpfActInd) in G1519 him G0846.
007:006 Then G3767 Jesus G2424 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, My G1699 time G2540 is G3918 not yet G3768 come G3918 (PresInd): but G1161 your G5212 time G2540 is G2076 (PresInd) alway G3842 ready G2092.
007:007 The world G2889 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) hate G3404 (PresActInf) you G5209; but G1161 me G1691 it hateth G3404 (PresActInd), because G3754 I G1473 testify G3140 (PresActInd) of G4012 it G0846, that G3754 the works G2041 thereof G0846 are G2076 (PresInd) evil G4190.
007:008 Go G0305 ye G5210 up G0305 (Aor2ActImpr) unto G1519 this G5026 feast G1859: I G1473 go G0305 not G3768 up G0305 (PresActInd) yet G3768 unto G1519 this G5026 feast G1859; for G3754 my G1699 time G2540 is G4137 not yet G3768 full come G4137 (PerfPasInd).
007:009 When G1161 he had said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) these words G5023 unto them G0846, he abode G3306 (AorActInd) [still] in G1722 Galilee G1056.
007:010 But G1161 when G5613 his G0846 brethren G0080 were gone up G0305 (Aor2ActInd), then G5119 went G0305 he G0846 also G2532 up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 the feast G1859, not G3756 openly G5320, but G0235 as it were G5613 in G1722 secret G2927.
007:011 Then G3767 the Jews G2453 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 at G1722 the feast G1859, and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Where G4226 is G2076 (PresInd) he G1565?
007:012 And G2532 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) much G4183 murmuring G1112 among G1722 the people G3793 concerning G4012 him G0846: for some G3303 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 He is G2076 (PresInd) a good man G0018: others G1161 G0243 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Nay G3756; but G0235 he deceiveth G4105 (PresActInd) the people G3793.
007:013 Howbeit G3305 no man G3762 spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) openly G3954 of G4012 him G0846 for G1223 fear G5401 of the Jews G2453.
007:014 Now G2235 about G1161 the midst of G3322 (PresActPtc) the feast G1859 Jesus G2424 went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the temple G2411, and G2532 taught G1321 (ImpfActInd).
007:015 And G2532 the Jews G2453 marvelled G2296 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), How G4459 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) this man G3778 letters G1121, having G3129 never G3361 learned G3129 (PerfActPtc)?
007:016 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), My G1699 doctrine G1322 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 mine G1699, but G0235 his that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
007:017 If G1437 any man G5100 will G2309 (PresActSubj) do G4160 (PresActInf) his G0846 will G2307, he shall know G1097 (FutMidDepInd) of G4012 the doctrine G1322, whether G4220 it be G2076 (PresInd) of G1537 God G2316, or G2228 [whether] I G1473 speak G2980 (PresActInd) of G0575 myself G1683.
007:018 He that speaketh G2980 (PresActPtc) of G0575 himself G1438 seeketh G2212 (PresActInd) his own G2398 glory G1391: but G1161 he that seeketh G2212 (PresActPtc) his glory G1391 that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) him G0846, the same G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0227, and G2532 no G3756 unrighteousness G0093 is G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 him G0846.
007:019 Did G1325 not G3756 Moses G3475 give G1325 (PerfActInd) you G5213 the law G3551, and G2532 [yet] none G3762 of G1537 you G5216 keepeth G4160 (PresActInd) the law G3551? Why G5101 go ye about G2212 (PresActInd) to kill G0615 (AorActInf) me G3165?
007:020 The people G3793 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) a devil G1140: who G5101 goeth about G2212 (PresActInd) to kill G0615 (AorActInf) thee G4571?
007:021 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, I have done G4160 (AorActInd) one G1520 work G2041, and G2532 ye G2296 all G3956 marvel G2296 (PresActInd).
007:022 Moses G3475 therefore G1223 G5124 gave G1325 (PerfActInd) unto you G5213 circumcision G4061; (not G3756 because G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) of G1537 Moses G3475, but G0235 of G1537 the fathers G3962;) and G2532 ye G4059 on G1722 the sabbath day G4521 circumcise G4059 (PresActInd) a man G0444.
007:023 If G1487 a man G0444 on G1722 the sabbath day G4521 receive G2983 (PresActInd) circumcision G4061, that G3363 the law G3551 of Moses G3475 should G3089 not G3363 be broken G3089 (AorPasSubj); are ye angry G5520 (PresActInd) at me G1698, because G3754 I have made G4160 (AorActInd) a man G0444 every whit G3650 whole G5199 on G1722 the sabbath day G4521?
007:024 Judge G2919 (PresActImpr) not G3361 according to G2596 the appearance G3799, but G0235 judge G2919 (AorActImpr) righteous G1342 judgment G2920.
007:025 Then G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) some G5100 of G1537 them of Jerusalem G2415, Is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 this G3778 he, whom G3739 they seek G2212 (PresActInd) to kill G0615 (AorActInf)?
007:026 But G2532, lo G2396, he speaketh G2980 (PresActInd) boldly G3954, and G2532 they say G3004 (PresActInd) nothing G3762 unto him G0846. Do G1097 the rulers G0758 know G1097 (Aor2ActInd) indeed G3379 G0230 that G3754 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the very G0230 Christ G5547?
007:027 Howbeit G0235 we know G1492 (PerfActInd) this man G5126 whence G4159 he is G2076 (PresInd): but G1161 when G3752 Christ G5547 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepSubj), no man G3762 knoweth G1097 (PresActInd) whence G4159 he is G2076 (PresInd).
007:028 Then G3767 cried G2896 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 in G1722 the temple G2411 as he taught G1321 (PresActPtc), G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Ye both G2504 know me G1492 (PerfActInd), and G2532 ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) whence G4159 I am G1510 (PresInd): and G2532 I am G2064 not G3756 come G2064 (Perf2ActInd) of G0575 myself G1683, but G0235 he that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0228, whom G3739 ye G5210 know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756.
007:029 But G1161 I G1473 know G1492 (PerfActInd) him G0846: for G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) from G3844 him G0846, and he G2548 hath sent G0649 (AorActInd) me G3165.
007:030 Then G3767 they sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to take G4084 (AorActInf) him G0846: but G2532 no man G3762 laid G1911 (Aor2ActInd) hands G5495 on G1909 him G0846, because G3754 his G0846 hour G5610 was G2064 not yet G3768 come G2064 (PlupfActInd).
007:031 And G1161 many G4183 of G1537 the people G3793 believed G4100 (AorActInd) on G1519 him G0846, and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 When G3752 Christ G5547 cometh G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), will he do G3385 G4160 (FutActInd) more G4119 miracles G4592 than these G5130 which G3739 this G3778 [man] hath done G4160 (AorActInd)?
007:032 The Pharisees G5330 heard G0191 (AorActInd) that the people G3793 murmured G1111 (PresActPtc) such things G5023 concerning G4012 him G0846; and G2532 the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 the chief priests G0749 sent G0649 (AorActInd) officers G5257 to G2443 take G4084 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
007:033 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto them G0846, Yet G2089 a little G3398 while G5550 am I G1510 (PresInd) with G3326 you G5216, and G2532 [then] I go G5217 (PresActInd) unto G4314 him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
007:034 Ye shall seek G2212 (FutActInd) me G3165, and G2532 shall G2147 not G3756 find G2147 (FutActInd) [me]: and G2532 where G3699 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd), [thither] ye G5210 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf).
007:035 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the Jews G2453 among G4314 themselves G1438, Whither G4226 will G3195 (PresActInd) he G3778 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf), that G3754 we G2249 shall G2147 not G3756 find G2147 (FutActInd) him G0846? will G3361 G3195 (PresActInd) he go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) unto G1519 the dispersed G1290 among the Gentiles G1672, and G2532 teach G1321 (PresActInf) the Gentiles G1672?
007:036 What G5101 [manner of] saying G3056 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778 that G3739 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Ye shall seek G2212 (FutActInd) me G3165, and G2532 shall G2147 not G3756 find G2147 (FutActInd) [me]: and G2532 where G3699 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd), [thither] ye G5210 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf)?
007:037 G1161 In G1722 the last G2078 day G2250, that great G3173 [day] of the feast G1859, Jesus G2424 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) and G2532 cried G2896 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), If G1437 any man G5100 thirst G1372 (PresActSubj), let him come G2064 (PresMidPasDepImpr) unto G4314 me G3165, and G2532 drink G4095 (PresActImpr).
007:038 He that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 me G1691, as G2531 the scripture G1124 hath said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), out of G1537 his G0846 belly G2836 shall flow G4482 (FutActInd) rivers G4215 of living G2198 (PresActPtc) water G5204.
007:039 (But G1161 this G5124 spake he G2036 (Aor2ActInd) of G4012 the Spirit G4151, which G3739 they that believe G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 him G0846 should G3195 (ImpfActInd) receive G2983 (PresActInf): for G1063 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 was G2258 (ImpfInd) not yet G3768 [given]; because G3754 that Jesus G2424 was G1392 not yet G3764 glorified G1392 (AorPasInd).)
007:040 Many G4183 of G1537 the people G3793 therefore G3767, when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) this saying G3056, said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Of a truth G0230 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the Prophet G4396.
007:041 Others G0243 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the Christ G5547. But G1161 some G0243 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G1063 Shall G3361 Christ G5547 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) out of G1537 Galilee G1056?
007:042 Hath not G3780 the scripture G1124 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), That G3754 Christ G5547 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) of G1537 the seed G4690 of David G1138, and G2532 out of G0575 the town G2968 of Bethlehem G0965, where G3699 David G1138 was G2258 (ImpfInd)?
007:043 So G3767 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a division G4978 among G1722 the people G3793 because G1223 of him G0846.
007:044 And G1161 some G5100 of G1537 them G0846 would G2309 (ImpfActInd) have taken G4084 (AorActInf) him G0846; but G0235 no man G3762 laid G1911 (Aor2ActInd) hands G5495 on G1909 him G0846.
007:045 Then G3767 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) the officers G5257 to G4314 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 Pharisees G5330; and G2532 they G1565 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G1302 have ye G0071 not G3756 brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846?
007:046 The officers G5257 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Never G3763 man G0444 spake G3779 G2980 (AorActInd) like G5613 this G3778 man G0444.
007:047 Then G3767 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846 the Pharisees G5330, Are G4105 ye G5210 also G2532 deceived G4105 (PerfPasInd) G3361?
007:048 Have any G3387 of G1537 the rulers G0758 or G2228 of G1537 the Pharisees G5330 believed G4100 (AorActInd) on G1519 him G0846?
007:049 But G0235 this G3778 people G3793 who G3588 knoweth G1097 (PresActPtc) not G3361 the law G3551 are G1526 (PresInd) cursed G1944.
007:050 Nicodemus G3530 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, (he that came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to Jesus G0846 by G4314 night G3571, being G5607 (PresPtc) one G1520 of G1537 them G0846,)
007:051 Doth G2919 our G2257 law G3551 judge G2919 (PresActInd) G3361 [any] man G0444, before G4386 G3362 it hear G0191 (AorActSubj) G3844 him G0846, and G2532 know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) what G5101 he doeth G4160 (PresActInd)?
007:052 They answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Art G3361 G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 also G2532 of G1537 Galilee G1056? Search G2045 (AorActImpr), and G2532 look G1492: for G3754 out of G1537 Galilee G1056 ariseth G1453 (PerfPasInd) no G3756 prophet G4396.
007:053 And G2532 every man G1538 went G4198 (AorPasDepInd) unto G1519 his own G0846 house G3624.
008:001 ¶  G1161 Jesus G2424 went G4198 (AorPasDepInd) unto G1519 the mount G3735 of Olives G1636.
008:002 And G1161 early in the morning G3722 he came G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd) again G3825 into G1519 the temple G2411, and G2532 all G3956 the people G2992 came G2064 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846; and G2532 he sat down G2523 (AorActPtc), and taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) them G0846.
008:003 And G1161 the scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330 brought G0071 (PresActInd) unto G4314 him G0846 a woman G1135 taken G2638 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 adultery G3430; and G2532 when they had set G2476 (AorActPtc) her G0846 in G1722 the midst G3319,
008:004 They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Master G1320, this G3778 woman G1135 was taken G2638 (AorPasInd) in adultery G3431 (PresPasPtc), in the very act G1888.
008:005 Now G1161 Moses G3475 in G1722 the law G3551 commanded G1781 (AorMidDepInd) us G2254, that such G5108 should be stoned G3036 (PresPasInf): but G3767 what G5101 sayest G3004 (PresActInd) thou G4771?
008:006 G1161 This G5124 they said G3004 (ImpfActInd), tempting G3985 (PresActPtc) him G0846, that G2443 they might have G2192 (PresActSubj) to accuse G2723 (PresActInf) him G0846. But G1161 Jesus G2424 stooped G2955 (AorActPtc) down G2736, and with [his] finger G1147 wrote G1125 (ImpfActInd) on G1519 the ground G1093, [as though he heard G4364 (PresMidPasDepPtc) them not G3361 ].
008:007 So G1161 when G5613 they continued G1961 (ImpfActInd) asking G2065 (PresActPtc) him G0846, he lifted up himself G0352 (AorActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, He that is without sin G0361 among you G5216, let him G0906 first G4413 cast G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) a stone G3037 at G1909 her G0846.
008:008 And G2532 again G3825 he stooped G2955 (AorActPtc) down G2736, and wrote G1125 (ImpfActInd) on G1519 the ground G1093.
008:009 And G1161 they which heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], G2532 being convicted G1651 (PresPasPtc) by G5259 [their own] conscience G4893, went out G1831 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) one by one G1527, beginning G0756 (AorMidPtc) at G0575 the eldest G4245, [even] unto G2193 the last G2078: and G2532 Jesus G2424 was left G2641 (AorPasInd) alone G3441, and G2532 the woman G1135 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 the midst G3319.
008:010 When G1161 Jesus G2424 had lifted up himself G0352 (AorActPtc), and G2532 saw G2300 (AorMidDepPtc) none G3367 but G4133 the woman G1135, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Woman G1135, where G4226 are G1526 (PresInd) those G1565 thine G4675 accusers G2725? hath G2632 no man G3762 condemned G2632 (AorActInd) thee G4571?
008:011 G1161 She said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), No man G3762, Lord G2962. And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Neither G3761 do G2632 I G1473 condemn G2632 (PresActInd) thee G4571: go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr), and G2532 sin G0264 (PresActImpr) no more G3371.
008:012 Then G3767 spake G2980 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 again G3825 unto them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the light G5457 of the world G2889: he that followeth G0190 (PresActPtc) me G1698 shall G4043 not G3364 walk G4043 (FutActInd) in G1722 darkness G4653, but G0235 shall have G2192 (FutActInd) the light G5457 of life G2222.
008:013 The Pharisees G5330 therefore G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thou G4771 bearest record G3140 (PresActInd) of G4012 thyself G4572; thy G4675 record G3141 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 true G0227.
008:014 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Though G2579 I G1473 bear record G3140 (PresActSubj) of G4012 myself G1683, [yet] my G3450 record G3141 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0227: for G3754 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) whence G4159 I came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 whither G4226 I go G5217 (PresActInd); but G1161 ye G5210 cannot G3756 tell G1492 (PerfActInd) whence G4159 I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 whither G4226 I go G5217 (PresActInd).
008:015 Ye G5210 judge G2919 (PresActInd) after G2596 the flesh G4561; I G1473 judge G2919 (PresActInd) no G3756 man G3762.
008:016 And G1161 yet G2532 if G1437 I G1473 judge G2919 (PresActSubj), my G1699 judgment G2920 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0227: for G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 alone G3441, but G0235 I G1473 and G2532 the Father G3962 that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
008:017 G2532 It is G1125 also G1161 written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 your G5212 law G3551, that G3754 the testimony G3141 of two G1417 men G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0227.
008:018 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) one that bear witness G3140 (PresActPtc) of G4012 myself G1683, and G2532 the Father G3962 that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165 beareth witness G3140 (PresActInd) of G4012 me G1700.
008:019 Then G3767 said they G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846, Where G4226 is G2076 (PresInd) thy G4675 Father G3962? Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Ye G1492 neither G3777 know G1492 (PerfActInd) me G1691, nor G3777 my G3450 Father G3962: if G1487 ye had known G1492 (PlupfActInd) me G1691, G2532 ye should have known G1492 (PlupfActInd) my G3450 Father G3962 also G0302.
008:020 These G5023 words G4487 spake G2980 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 in G1722 the treasury G1049, as he taught G1321 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411: and G2532 no man G3762 laid hands G4084 (AorActInd) on him G0846; for G3754 his G0846 hour G5610 was G2064 not yet G3768 come G2064 (PlupfActInd).
008:021 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 again G3825 unto them G0846, I G1473 go my way G5217 (PresActInd), and G2532 ye shall seek G2212 (FutActInd) me G3165, and G2532 shall die G0599 (FutMidDepInd) in G1722 your G5216 sins G0266: whither G3699 I G1473 go G5217 (PresActInd), ye G5210 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf).
008:022 Then G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) the Jews G2453, Will he kill G3385 G0615 (FutActInd) himself G1438? because G3754 he saith G3004 (PresActInd), Whither G3699 I G1473 go G5217 (PresActInd), ye G5210 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf).
008:023 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) from G1537 beneath G2736; I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) from G1537 above G0507: ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) of G1537 this G5127 world G2889; I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 this G5127 world G2889.
008:024 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) therefore G3767 unto you G5213, that G3754 ye shall die G0599 (FutMidDepInd) in G1722 your G5216 sins G0266: for G1063 if G3362 ye believe G4100 (AorActSubj) not G3362 that G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) [he], ye shall die G0599 (FutMidDepInd) in G1722 your G5216 sins G0266.
008:025 Then G3767 said they G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846, Who G5101 art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771? And G2532 Jesus G2424 saith G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Even G3748 G2532 [the same] that I said G2980 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 from the beginning G0746.
008:026 I have G2192 (PresActInd) many things G4183 to say G2980 (PresActInf) and G2532 to judge G2919 (PresActInf) of G4012 you G5216: but G0235 he that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0227; and I G2504 speak G3004 (PresActInd) to G1519 the world G2889 those things G5023 which G3739 I have heard G0191 (AorActInd) of G3844 him G0846.
008:027 They understood G1097 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 that G3754 he spake G3004 (ImpfActInd) to them G0846 of the Father G3962.
008:028 Then G5119 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto them G0846, When G3752 ye have lifted up G5312 (AorActSubj) the Son G5207 of man G0444, then G3767 shall ye know G1097 (FutMidDepInd) that G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) [he], and G2532 [that] I do G4160 (PresActInd) nothing G3762 of G0575 myself G1683; but G0235 as G2531 my G3450 Father G3962 hath taught G1321 (AorActInd) me G3165, I speak G2980 (PresActInd) these things G5023.
008:029 And G2532 he that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165 is G2076 (PresInd) with G3326 me G1700: the Father G3962 hath G0863 not G3756 left G0863 (AorActInd) me G3165 alone G3441; for G3754 I G1473 do G4160 (PresActInd) always G3842 those things that please G0701 him G0846.
008:030 As he G0846 spake G2980 (PresActPtc) these words G5023, many G4183 believed G4100 (AorActInd) on G1519 him G0846.
008:031 Then G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) Jesus G2424 to G4314 those Jews G2453 which G3588 believed G4100 (PerfActPtc) on him G0846, If G1437 ye G5210 continue G3306 (AorActSubj) in G1722 my G1699 word G3056, [then] are ye G2075 (PresInd) my G3450 disciples G3101 indeed G0230;
008:032 And G2532 ye shall know G1097 (FutMidDepInd) the truth G0225, and G2532 the truth G0225 shall make G1659 you G5209 free G1659 (FutActInd).
008:033 They answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, We be G2070 (PresInd) Abraham’s G0011 seed G4690, and G2532 were G1398 never G4455 in bondage G1398 (PerfActInd) to any man G3762: how G4459 sayest G3004 (PresActInd) thou G4771, G3754 Ye shall be made G1096 (FutMidDepInd) free G1658?
008:034 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 Whosoever G3956 committeth G4160 (PresActPtc) sin G0266 is G2076 (PresInd) the servant G1401 of sin G0266.
008:035 And G1161 the servant G1401 abideth G3306 (PresActInd) not G3756 in G1722 the house G3614 for G1519 ever G0165: [but] the Son G5207 abideth G3306 (PresActInd) G1519 ever G0165.
008:036 If G1437 the Son G5207 therefore G3767 shall make G1659 you G5209 free G1659 (AorActSubj), ye shall be G2071 (FutInd) free G1658 indeed G3689.
008:037 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 ye are G2075 (PresInd) Abraham’s G0011 seed G4690; but G0235 ye seek G2212 (PresActInd) to kill G0615 (AorActInf) me G3165, because G3754 my G1699 word G3056 hath G5562 no G3756 place G5562 (PresActInd) in G1722 you G5213.
008:038 I G1473 speak G2980 (PresActInd) that which G3739 I have seen G3708 (PerfActInd) with G3844 my G3450 Father G3962: and G2532 ye G5210 do G4160 (PresActInd) that G3767 which G3739 ye have seen G3708 (PerfActInd) with G3844 your G5216 father G3962.
008:039 They answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Abraham G0011 is G2076 (PresInd) our G2257 father G3962. Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, If G1487 ye were G2258 (ImpfInd) Abraham’s G0011 children G5043, ye would do G4160 (ImpfActInd) G0302 the works G2041 of Abraham G0011.
008:040 But G1161 now G3568 ye seek G2212 (PresActInd) to kill G0615 (AorActInf) me G3165, a man G0444 that G3739 hath told G2980 (PerfActInd) you G5213 the truth G0225, which G3739 I have heard G0191 (AorActInd) of G3844 God G2316: this G5124 did G4160 (AorActInd) not G3756 Abraham G0011.
008:041 Ye G5210 do G4160 (PresActInd) the deeds G2041 of your G5216 father G3962. Then G3767 said they G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to him G0846, We G2249 be G1080 not G3756 born G1080 (PerfPasInd) of G1537 fornication G4202; we have G2192 (PresActInd) one G1520 Father G3962, [even] God G2316.
008:042 Jesus G2424 G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, If G1487 God G2316 were G2258 (ImpfInd) your G5216 Father G3962, ye would G0302 love G0025 (ImpfActInd) me G1691: for G1063 I G1473 proceeded forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 came G2240 (PresActInd) from G1537 God G2316; neither G3761 G1063 came I G2064 (Perf2ActInd) of G0575 myself G1683, but G0235 he G1565 sent G0649 (AorActInd) me G3165.
008:043 Why G1302 do ye G1097 not G3756 understand G1097 (PresActInd) my G1699 speech G2981? [even] because G3754 ye cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) hear G0191 (PresActInf) my G1699 word G3056.
008:044 Ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) of G1537 [your] father G3962 the devil G1228, and G2532 the lusts G1939 of your G5216 father G3962 ye will G2309 (PresActInd) do G4160 (PresActInf). He G1565 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a murderer G0443 from G0575 the beginning G0746, and G2532 abode G2476 (ImpfActInd/PerfActInd) not G3756 in G1722 the truth G0225, because G3754 there is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 truth G0225 in G1722 him G0846. When G3752 he speaketh G2980 (PresActSubj) a lie G5579, he speaketh G2980 (PresActInd) of G1537 his own G2398: for G3754 he is G2076 (PresInd) a liar G5583, and G2532 the father G3962 of it G0846.
008:045 And G1161 because G3754 I G1473 tell G3004 (PresActInd) [you] the truth G0225, ye believe G4100 (PresActInd) me G3427 not G3756.
008:046 Which G5101 of G1537 you G5216 convinceth G1651 (PresActInd) me G3165 of G4012 sin G0266? And G1161 if G1487 I say G3004 (PresActInd) the truth G0225, why G1302 do G4100 ye G5210 not G3756 believe G4100 (PresActInd) me G3427?
008:047 He that is G5607 (PresPtc) of G1537 God G2316 heareth G0191 (PresActInd) God’s G2316 words G4487: ye G5210 therefore G5124 G1223 hear G0191 (PresActInd) [them] not G3756, because G3754 ye are G2075 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 God G2316.
008:048 Then G3767 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) the Jews G2453, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Say G3004 (PresActInd) we G2249 not G3756 well G2573 that G3754 thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) a Samaritan G4541, and G2532 hast G2192 (PresActInd) a devil G1140?
008:049 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), I G1473 have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 a devil G1140; but G0235 I honour G5091 (PresActInd) my G3450 Father G3962, and G2532 ye G5210 do dishonour G0818 (PresActInd) me G3165.
008:050 And G1161 I G1473 seek G2212 (PresActInd) not G3756 mine own G3450 glory G1391: there is G2076 (PresInd) one that seeketh G2212 (PresActPtc) and G2532 judgeth G2919 (PresActPtc).
008:051 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, If G1437 a man G5100 keep G5083 (AorActSubj) my G1699 saying G3056, he shall G2334 never G3364 G1519 G0165 see G2334 (AorActSubj) death G2288.
008:052 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the Jews G2453 unto him G0846, Now G3568 we know G1097 (PerfActInd) that G3754 thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) a devil G1140. Abraham G0011 is dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the prophets G4396; and G2532 thou G4771 sayest G3004 (PresActInd), If G1437 a man G5100 keep G5083 (AorActSubj) my G3450 saying G3056, he shall G1089 never G3364 G1519 G0165 taste G1089 (FutMidDepInd) of death G2288.
008:053 Art G3361 G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 greater than G3187 our G2257 father G3962 Abraham G0011, which G3748 is dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd)? and G2532 the prophets G4396 are dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd): whom G5101 makest G4160 (PresActInd) thou G4771 thyself G4572?
008:054 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), If G1437 I G1473 honour G1392 (PresActInd) myself G1683, my G3450 honour G1391 is G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3762: it is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 Father G3962 that honoureth G1392 (PresActPtc) me G3165; of whom G3739 ye G5210 say G3004 (PresActInd), that G3754 he is G2076 (PresInd) your G5216 God G2316:
008:055 Yet G2532 ye have G1097 not G3756 known G1097 (PerfActInd) him G0846; but G1161 I G1473 know G1492 (PerfActInd) him G0846: and G2532 if G1437 I should say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), G3754 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) him G0846 not G3756, I shall be G2071 (FutInd) a liar G5583 like G3664 unto you G5216: but G0235 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) him G0846, and G2532 keep G5083 (PresActInd) his G0846 saying G3056.
008:056 Your G5216 father G3962 Abraham G0011 rejoiced G0021 (AorMidDepInd) to G2443 see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) my G1699 day G2250: and G2532 he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) [it], and G2532 was glad G5463 (Aor2PasDepInd).
008:057 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the Jews G2453 unto G4314 him G0846, Thou art G2192 (PresActInd) not yet G3768 fifty G4004 years old G2094, and G2532 hast thou seen G3708 (PerfActInd) Abraham G0011?
008:058 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Before G4250 Abraham G0011 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd).
008:059 Then G3767 took they up G0142 (AorActInd) stones G3037 to G2443 cast G0906 (Aor2ActSubj) at G1909 him G0846: but G1161 Jesus G2424 hid himself G2928 (Aor2PasDepSubj), and G2532 went G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the temple G2411, going G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) through G1223 the midst G3319 of them G0846, and G2532 so G3779 passed by G3855 (ImpfActInd).
009:001 ¶  And G2532 as [Jesus] passed by G3855 (PresActPtc), he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a man G0444 which was blind G5185 from G1537 [his] birth G1079.
009:002 And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 asked G2065 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G4461, who G5101 did sin G0264 (Aor2ActInd), this man G3778, or G2228 his G0846 parents G1118, that G2443 he was born G1080 (AorPasSubj) blind G5185?
009:003 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Neither G3777 hath G0264 this man G3778 sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd), nor G3777 his G0846 parents G1118: but G0235 that G2443 the works G2041 of God G2316 should be made manifest G5319 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 him G0846.
009:004 I G1691 must G1163 (PresInd) work G2038 (PresMidPasDepInf) the works G2041 of him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165, while G2193 it is G2076 (PresInd) day G2250: the night G3571 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), when G3753 no man G3762 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) work G2038 (PresMidPasDepInf).
009:005 As long as G3752 I am G5600 (PresSubj) in G1722 the world G2889, I am G1510 (PresInd) the light G5457 of the world G2889.
009:006 When he had thus G5023 spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), he spat G4429 (AorActInd) on the ground G5476, and G2532 made G4160 (AorActInd) clay G4081 of G1537 the spittle G4427, and G2532 he anointed G2025 (AorActInd) G1909 the eyes G3788 of the blind man G5185 with the clay G4081,
009:007 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Go G5217 (PresActImpr), wash G3538 (AorMidImpr) in G1519 the pool G2861 of Siloam G4611, (which G3739 is by interpretation G2059 (PresPasInd), Sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc).) He went his way G0565 (Aor2ActInd) therefore G3767, and G2532 washed G3538 (AorMidInd), and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) seeing G0991 (PresActPtc).
009:008 The neighbours G1069 therefore G3767, and G2532 they which before G4386 had seen G2334 (PresActPtc) him G0846 that G3754 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) blind G5185, said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 this G3778 he that sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) and G2532 begged G4319 (PresActPtc)?
009:009 Some G0243 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 This G3778 is he G2076 (PresInd): G1161 others G0243 [said], G3754 He is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 him G0846: [but] he G1565 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) [he].
009:010 Therefore G3767 said they G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846, How G4459 were G0455 thine G4675 eyes G3788 opened G0455 (AorPasInd)?
009:011 He G1565 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), A man G0444 that is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Jesus G2424 made G4160 (AorActInd) clay G4081, and G2532 anointed G2025 (AorActInd) mine G3450 eyes G3788, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto me G3427, Go G5217 (PresActImpr) to G1519 the pool G2861 of Siloam G4611, and G2532 wash G3538 (AorMidImpr): and G1161 I went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and G2532 washed G3538 (AorMidPtc), and I received sight G0308 (AorActInd).
009:012 Then G3767 said they G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Where G4226 is G2076 (PresInd) he G1565? He said G3004 (PresActInd), I know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756.
009:013 They brought G0071 (PresActInd) to G4314 the Pharisees G5330 him G0846 that aforetime G4218 was blind G5185.
009:014 And G1161 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) the sabbath day G4521 when G3753 Jesus G2424 made G4160 (AorActInd) the clay G4081, and G2532 opened G0455 (AorActInd) his G0846 eyes G3788.
009:015 Then G3767 again G3825 the Pharisees G5330 also G2532 asked G2065 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 how G4459 he had received his sight G0308 (AorActInd). G1161 He said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, He put G2007 (AorActInd) clay G4081 upon G1909 mine G3450 eyes G3788, and G2532 I washed G3538 (AorMidInd), and G2532 do see G0991 (PresActInd).
009:016 Therefore G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) some G5100 of G1537 the Pharisees G5330, This G3778 man G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 of G3844 God G2316, because G3754 he keepeth G5083 (PresActInd) not G3756 the sabbath day G4521. Others G0243 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), How G4459 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) a man G0444 that is a sinner G0268 do G4160 (PresActInf) such G5108 miracles G4592? And G2532 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a division G4978 among G1722 them G0846.
009:017 They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto the blind man G5185 again G3825, What G5101 sayest G3004 (PresActInd) thou G4771 of G4012 him G0846, that G3754 he hath opened G0455 (AorActInd) thine G4675 eyes G3788? He said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), G3754 G1161 He is G2076 (PresInd) a prophet G4396.
009:018 But G3767 the Jews G2453 did G4100 not G3756 believe G4100 (AorActInd) concerning G4012 him G0846, that G3754 he had been G2258 (ImpfInd) blind G5185, and G2532 received his sight G0308 (AorActInd), until G2193 G3755 they called G5455 (AorActInd) the parents G1118 of him G0846 that had received his sight G0308 (AorActPtc).
009:019 And G2532 they asked G2065 (AorActInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778 your G5216 son G5207, who G3739 ye G5210 say G3004 (PresActInd) G3754 was born G1080 (AorPasInd) blind G5185? how G4459 then G3767 doth he G0991 now G0737 see G0991 (PresActInd)?
009:020 His G0846 parents G1118 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846 and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), We know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) our G2257 son G5207, and G2532 that G3754 he was born G1080 (AorPasInd) blind G5185:
009:021 But G1161 by what means G4459 he G0991 now G3568 seeth G0991 (PresActInd), we know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756; or G2228 who G5101 hath opened G0455 (AorActInd) his G0846 eyes G3788, we G2249 know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756: he G0846 is G2192 (PresActInd) of age G2244; ask G2065 (AorActImpr) him G0846: he G0846 shall speak G2980 (FutActInd) for G4012 himself G0848.
009:022 These G5023 [words] spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 parents G1118, because G3754 they feared G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) the Jews G2453: for G1063 the Jews G2453 had agreed G4934 (PlupfMidInd) already G2235, that G2443 if G1437 any man G5100 did confess G3670 (AorActSubj) that he G0846 was Christ G5547, he should be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) put out of the synagogue G0656.
009:023 Therefore G1223 G5124 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 parents G1118, G3754 He is G2192 (PresActInd) of age G2244; ask G2065 (AorActImpr) him G0846.
009:024 Then G3767 again G1208 G1537 called they G5455 (AorActInd) the man G0444 that G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) blind G5185, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) God G2316 the praise G1391: we G2249 know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 this G3778 man G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) a sinner G0268.
009:025 G3767 He G1565 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Whether G1487 he be G2076 (PresInd) a sinner G0268 [or no], I know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756: one thing G1520 I know G1492 (PerfActInd), that G3754, whereas I was G5607 (PresPtc) blind G5185, now G0737 I see G0991 (PresActInd).
009:026 Then G1161 said they G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to him G0846 again G3825, What G5101 did he G4160 (AorActInd) to thee G4671? how G4459 opened he G0455 (AorActInd) thine G4675 eyes G3788?
009:027 He answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, I have told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) you G5213 already G2235, and G2532 ye did G0191 not G3756 hear G0191 (AorActInd): wherefore G5101 would G2309 (PresActInd) ye hear G0191 (PresActInf) [it] again G3825? will G3361 G2309 (PresActInd) ye G5210 also G2532 be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) his G0846 disciples G3101?
009:028 Then G3767 they reviled G3058 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) his G1565 disciple G3101; but G1161 we G2249 are G2070 (PresInd) Moses G3475 ’ disciples G3101.
009:029 We G2249 know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 God G2316 spake G2980 (PerfActInd) unto Moses G3475: [as for] this G1161 G5126 [fellow], we know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 from whence G4159 he is G2076 (PresInd).
009:030 The man G0444 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G1063 herein G1722 G5129 is G2076 (PresInd) a marvellous thing G2298, that G3754 ye G5210 know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 from whence G4159 he is G2076 (PresInd), and G2532 [yet] he hath opened G0455 (AorActInd) mine G3450 eyes G3788.
009:031 Now G1161 we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 God G2316 heareth G0191 (PresActInd) not G3756 sinners G0268: but G0235 if G1437 any man G5100 be G5600 (PresSubj) a worshipper of God G2318, and G2532 doeth G4160 (PresActSubj) his G0846 will G2307, him G5127 he heareth G0191 (PresActInd).
009:032 Since G1537 the world began G0165 was it G0191 not G3756 heard G0191 (AorPasInd) that G3754 any man G5100 opened G0455 (AorActInd) the eyes G3788 of one that was born G1080 (PerfPasPtc) blind G5185.
009:033 If G1508 this man G3778 were G2258 (ImpfInd) not G1508 of G3844 God G2316, he could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) G3756 do G4160 (PresActInf) nothing G3762.
009:034 They answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thou G4771 wast G1080 altogether G3650 born G1080 (AorPasInd) in G1722 sins G0266, and G2532 dost thou G4771 teach G1321 (PresActInd) us G2248? And G2532 they cast G1544 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 out G1854.
009:035 Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G3754 they had cast G1544 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 out G1854; and G2532 when he had found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Dost G4100 thou G4771 believe G4100 (PresActInd) on G1519 the Son G5207 of God G2316?
009:036 He G1565 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Who G5101 is he G2076 (PresInd), Lord G2962, that G2443 I might believe G4100 (AorActSubj) on G1519 him G0846?
009:037 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thou hast G3708 both G2532 seen G3708 (PerfActInd) him G0846, and G2532 it is G2076 (PresInd) he G1565 that talketh G2980 (PresActPtc) with G3326 thee G4675.
009:038 And G1161 he said G5346 (ImpfInd), Lord G2962, I believe G4100 (PresActInd). And G2532 he worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) him G0846.
009:039 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), For G1519 judgment G2917 I G1473 am come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 this G5126 world G2889, that G2443 they which see G0991 (PresActPtc) not G3361 might see G0991 (PresActSubj); and G2532 that they which see G0991 (PresActPtc) might be made G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) blind G5185.
009:040 And G2532 [some] of G1537 the Pharisees G5330 which G3588 were G5607 (PresPtc) with G3326 him G0846 heard G0191 (AorActInd) these words G5023, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Are G3361 G2070 (PresInd) we G2249 blind G5185 also G2532?
009:041 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, If G1487 ye were G2258 (ImpfInd) blind G5185, ye should G0302 have G2192 (ImpfActInd) no G3756 sin G0266: but G1161 now G3568 ye say G3004 (PresActInd), G3754 We see G0991 (PresActInd); therefore G3767 your G5216 sin G0266 remaineth G3306 (PresActInd).
010:001 ¶  Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, He that entereth G1525 (PresMidPasDepPtc) not G3361 by G1223 the door G2374 into G1519 the sheepfold G4263 G0833, but G0235 climbeth up G0305 (PresActPtc) some other way G0237, the same G1565 is G2076 (PresInd) a thief G2812 and G2532 a robber G3027.
010:002 But G1161 he that entereth in G1525 (PresMidPasDepPtc) by G1223 the door G2374 is G2076 (PresInd) the shepherd G4166 of the sheep G4263.
010:003 To him G5129 the porter G2377 openeth G0455 (PresActInd); and G2532 the sheep G4263 hear G0191 (PresActInd) his G0846 voice G5456: and G2532 he calleth G2564 (PresActInd) his own G2398 sheep G4263 by G2596 name G3686, and G2532 leadeth G1806 them G0846 out G1806 (PresActInd).
010:004 And G2532 when G3752 he putteth forth G1544 (Aor2ActSubj) his own G2398 sheep G4263, he goeth G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd) before G1715 them G0846, and G2532 the sheep G4263 follow G0190 (PresActInd) him G0846: for G3754 they know G1492 (PerfActInd) his G0846 voice G5456.
010:005 And G1161 a stranger G0245 will they G0190 not G3364 follow G0190 (AorActSubj), but G0235 will flee G5343 (FutMidDepInd) from G0575 him G0846: for G3754 they know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 the voice G5456 of strangers G0245.
010:006 This G5026 parable G3942 spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto them G0846: but G1161 they G1565 understood G1097 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 what things G5101 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) which G3739 he spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846.
010:007 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto them G0846 again G3825, Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the door G2374 of the sheep G4263.
010:008 All G3956 that ever G3745 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) before G4253 me G1700 are G1526 (PresInd) thieves G2812 and G2532 robbers G3027: but G0235 the sheep G4263 did G0191 not G3756 hear G0191 (AorActInd) them G0846.
010:009 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the door G2374: by G1223 me G1700 if G1437 any man G5100 enter in G1525 (Aor2ActSubj), he shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd), and G2532 shall go in G1525 (FutMidDepInd) and G2532 out G1831 (FutMidDepInd), and G2532 find G2147 (FutActInd) pasture G3542.
010:010 The thief G2812 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756, but G1508 for to G2443 steal G2813 (AorActSubj), and G2532 to kill G2380 (AorActSubj), and G2532 to destroy G0622 (AorActSubj): I G1473 am come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) that G2443 they might have G2192 (PresActSubj) life G2222, and G2532 that they might have G2192 (PresActSubj) [it] more abundantly G4053.
010:011 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the good G2570 shepherd G4166: the good G2570 shepherd G4166 giveth G5087 (PresActInd) his G0846 life G5590 for G5228 the sheep G4263.
010:012 But G1161 he that is G5607 (PresPtc) an hireling G3411, and G2532 not G3756 the shepherd G4166, whose G3739 own G2398 the sheep G4263 are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756, seeth G2334 (PresActInd) the wolf G3074 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 leaveth G0863 (PresActInd) the sheep G4263, and G2532 fleeth G5343 (PresActInd): and G2532 the wolf G3074 catcheth G0726 (PresActInd) them G0846, and G2532 scattereth G4650 (PresActInd) the sheep G4263.
010:013 G1161 The hireling G3411 fleeth G5343 (PresActInd), because G3754 he is G2076 (PresInd) an hireling G3411, and G2532 G0846 careth G3199 (PresActInd) not G3756 for G4012 the sheep G4263.
010:014 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the good G2570 shepherd G4166, and G2532 know G1097 (PresActInd) my G1699 [sheep], and G2532 am known G1097 (PresPasInd) of G5259 mine G1699.
010:015 As G2531 the Father G3962 knoweth G1097 (PresActInd) me G3165, even so G2504 know G1097 (PresActInd) I G2504 the Father G3962: and G2532 I lay down G5087 (PresActInd) my G3450 life G5590 for G5228 the sheep G4263.
010:016 And G2532 other G0243 sheep G4263 I have G2192 (PresActInd), which G3739 are G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 this G5026 fold G0833: them also G2548 I G3165 must G1163 (PresInd) bring G0071 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 they shall hear G0191 (FutActInd) my G3450 voice G5456; and G2532 there shall be G1096 (FutMidDepInd) one G3391 fold G4167, [and] one G1520 shepherd G4166.
010:017 Therefore G5124 G1223 doth G0025 my Father G3962 love G0025 (PresActInd) me G3165, because G3754 I G1473 lay down G5087 (PresActInd) my G3450 life G5590, that G2443 I might take G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) it G0846 again G3825.
010:018 No man G3762 taketh G0142 (PresActInd) it G0846 from G0575 me G1700, but G0235 I G1473 lay G5087 it G0846 down G5087 (PresActInd) of G0575 myself G1683. I have G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 to lay G5087 it G0846 down G5087 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 I have G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 to take G2983 (Aor2ActInf) it G0846 again G3825. This G5026 commandment G1785 have I received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) of G3844 my G3450 Father G3962.
010:019 There was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a division G4978 therefore G3767 again G3825 among G1722 the Jews G2453 for G1223 these G5128 sayings G3056.
010:020 And G1161 many G4183 of G1537 them G0846 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), He hath G2192 (PresActInd) a devil G1140, and G2532 is mad G3105 (PresMidPasDepInd); why G5101 hear ye G0191 (PresActInd) him G0846?
010:021 Others G0243 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), These G5023 are G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 the words G4487 of him that hath a devil G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc). Can G3361 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) a devil G1140 open G0455 (PresActInf) the eyes G3788 of the blind G5185?
010:022 And G1161 it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) at G1722 Jerusalem G2414 the feast of the dedication G1456, and G2532 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) winter G5494.
010:023 And G2532 Jesus G2424 walked G4043 (ImpfActInd) in G1722 the temple G2411 in G1722 Solomon’s G4672 porch G4745.
010:024 Then G3767 came G2944 the Jews G2453 round about G2944 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846, How long G2193 G4219 dost thou make G0142 (PresActInd) us G2257 to doubt G5590? If G1487 thou G4771 be G1488 (PresInd) the Christ G5547, tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254 plainly G3954.
010:025 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, I told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) you G5213, and G2532 ye believed G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756: the works G2041 that G3739 I G1473 do G4160 (PresActInd) in G1722 my G3450 Father’s G3962 name G3686, they G5023 bear witness G3140 (PresActInd) of G4012 me G1700.
010:026 But G0235 ye G5210 believe G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756, because G1063 ye are G2075 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 my G1699 sheep G4263, as G2531 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto you G5213.
010:027 My G1699 sheep G4263 hear G0191 (PresActInd) my G3450 voice G5456, and I G2504 know G1097 (PresActInd) them G0846, and G2532 they follow G0190 (PresActInd) me G3427:
010:028 And I G2504 give G1325 (PresActInd) unto them G0846 eternal G0166 life G2222; and G2532 they shall G0622 never G3364 G1519 G0165 perish G0622 (Aor2MidSubj), neither G2532 G3756 shall G0726 any G5100 [man] pluck G0726 (FutActInd) them G0846 out of G1537 my G3450 hand G5495.
010:029 My G3450 Father G3962, which G3739 gave G1325 (PerfActInd) [them] me G3427, is G2076 (PresInd) greater than G3187 all G3956; and G2532 no G3762 [man] is able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) to pluck G0726 (PresActInf) [them] out of G1537 my G3450 Father’s G3962 hand G5495.
010:030 I G1473 and G2532 [my] Father G3962 are G2070 (PresInd) one G1520.
010:031 Then G3767 the Jews G2453 took up G0941 (AorActInd) stones G3037 again G3825 to G2443 stone G3034 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
010:032 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, Many G4183 good G2570 works G2041 have I shewed G1166 (AorActInd) you G5213 from G1537 my G3450 Father G3962; for G1223 which G4169 of those G0846 works G2041 do ye stone G3034 (PresActInd) me G3165?
010:033 The Jews G2453 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), For G4012 a good G2570 work G2041 we stone G3034 (PresActInd) thee G4571 not G3756; but G0235 for G4012 blasphemy G0988; and G2532 because G3754 that thou G4771, being G5607 (PresPtc) a man G0444, makest G4160 (PresActInd) thyself G4572 God G2316.
010:034 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, Is it G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 your G5216 law G3551, I G1473 said G2036 (AorActInd), Ye are G2075 (PresInd) gods G2316?
010:035 If G1487 he called G2036 (Aor2ActInd) them G1565 gods G2316, unto G4314 whom G3739 the word G3056 of God G2316 came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), and G2532 the scripture G1124 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be broken G3089 (AorPasInf);
010:036 Say G3004 (PresActInd) ye G5210 of him, whom G3739 the Father G3962 hath sanctified G0037 (AorActInd), and G2532 sent G0649 (AorActInd) into G1519 the world G2889, G3754 Thou blasphemest G0987 (PresActInd); because G3754 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I am G1510 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316?
010:037 If G1487 I do G4160 (PresActInd) not G3756 the works G2041 of my G3450 Father G3962, believe G4100 (PresActImpr) me G3427 not G3361.
010:038 But G1161 if G1487 I do G4160 (PresActInd), though G2579 ye believe G4100 (PresActSubj) not G3361 me G1698, believe G4100 (AorActImpr) the works G2041: that G2443 ye may know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj), and G2532 believe G4100 (AorActSubj), that G3754 the Father G3962 [is] in G1722 me G1698, and I G2504 in G1722 him G0846.
010:039 Therefore G3767 they sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) again G3825 to take G4084 (AorActInf) him G0846: but G2532 he escaped G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 their G0846 hand G5495,
010:040 And G2532 went away G0565 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825 beyond G4008 Jordan G2446 into G1519 the place G5117 where G3699 John G2491 at first G4412 baptized G0907 (PresActPtc) G2258 (ImpfInd); and G2532 there G1563 he abode G3306 (AorActInd).
010:041 And G2532 many G4183 resorted G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 John G2491 did G4160 (AorActInd) no G3303 G3762 miracle G4592: but G1161 all things G3956 that G3745 John G2491 spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) of G4012 this man G5127 were G2258 (ImpfInd) true G0227.
010:042 And G2532 many G4183 believed G4100 (AorActInd) on G1519 him G0846 there G1563.
011:001 ¶  Now G1161 a certain G5100 [man] was G2258 (ImpfInd) sick G0770 (PresActPtc), [named] Lazarus G2976, of G0575 Bethany G0963, G1537 the town G2968 of Mary G3137 and G2532 her G0846 sister G0079 Martha G3136.
011:002 G1161 (It was G2258 (ImpfInd) [that] Mary G3137 which G3588 anointed G0218 (AorActPtc) the Lord G2962 with ointment G3464, and G2532 wiped G1591 (AorActPtc) his G0846 feet G4228 with her G0846 hair G2359, whose G3739 brother G0080 Lazarus G2976 was sick G0770 (ImpfActInd).)
011:003 Therefore G3767 his sisters G0079 sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, behold G2396, he whom G3739 thou lovest G5368 (PresActInd) is sick G0770 (PresActInd).
011:004 When G1161 Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [that], he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), This G3778 sickness G0769 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 unto G4314 death G2288, but G0235 for G5228 the glory G1391 of God G2316, that G2443 the Son G5207 of God G2316 might be glorified G1392 (AorPasSubj) thereby G1223 G0846.
011:005 Now G1161 Jesus G2424 loved G0025 (ImpfActInd) Martha G3136, and G2532 her G0846 sister G0079, and G2532 Lazarus G2976.
011:006 When G5613 he had heard G0191 (AorActInd) therefore G3767 that G3754 he was sick G0770 (PresActInd), he abode G3306 (AorActInd) two G1417 days G2250 still G5119 G3303 in G1722 the same place G5117 where G3739 he was G2258 (ImpfInd).
011:007 Then G1899 after G3326 that G5124 saith he G3004 (PresActInd) to [his] disciples G3101, Let us go G0071 (PresActSubj) into G1519 Judaea G2449 again G3825.
011:008 [His] disciples G3101 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Master G4461, the Jews G2453 of late G3568 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to stone G3034 (AorActInf) thee G4571; and G2532 goest thou G5217 (PresActInd) thither G1563 again G3825?
011:009 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Are there G1526 (PresInd) not G3780 twelve G1427 hours G5610 in the day G2250? If G1437 any man G5100 walk G4043 (PresActSubj) in G1722 the day G2250, he stumbleth G4350 (PresActInd) not G3756, because G3754 he seeth G0991 (PresActInd) the light G5457 of this G5127 world G2889.
011:010 But G1161 if G1437 a man G5100 walk G4043 (PresActSubj) in G1722 the night G3571, he stumbleth G4350 (PresActInd), because G3754 there is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 light G5457 in G1722 him G0846.
011:011 These things G5023 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) he G0846: and G2532 after G3326 that G5124 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Our G2257 friend G5384 Lazarus G2976 sleepeth G2837 (PerfPasInd); but G0235 I go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd), that G2443 I may awake G1852 him G0846 out of sleep G1852 (AorActSubj).
011:012 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 disciples G3101, Lord G2962, if G1487 he sleep G2837 (PerfPasInd), he shall do well G4982 (FutPasInd).
011:013 Howbeit G1161 Jesus G2424 spake G2046 (PlupfActInd) of G4012 his G0846 death G2288: but G1161 they G1565 thought G1380 (AorActInd) that G3754 he had spoken G3004 (PresActInd) of G4012 taking of rest G2838 in sleep G5258.
011:014 Then G5119 G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto them G0846 plainly G3954, Lazarus G2976 is dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd).
011:015 And G2532 I am glad G5463 (PresActInd) for G1223 your sakes G5209 that G3754 I was G2252 (ImpfInd) G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3756 there G1563, to the intent G2443 ye may believe G4100 (AorActSubj); nevertheless G0235 let us go G0071 (PresActSubj) unto G4314 him G0846.
011:016 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Thomas G2381, which G3588 is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Didymus G1324, unto his fellowdisciples G4827, Let us G0071 also G2532 go G0071 (PresActSubj), that G2443 we G2249 may die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj) with G3326 him G0846.
011:017 Then G3767 when Jesus G2424 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), he found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) that he G0846 had G2192 (PresActPtc) [lain] in G1722 the grave G3419 four G5064 days G2250 already G2235.
011:018 Now G1161 Bethany G0963 was G2258 (ImpfInd) nigh G1451 unto Jerusalem G2414, about G5613 fifteen G1178 furlongs G4712 off G0575:
011:019 And G2532 many G4183 of G1537 the Jews G2453 came G2064 (PlupfActInd) to G4314 Martha G3136 and G2532 Mary G3137 G4012, to G2443 comfort G3888 (AorMidDepSubj) them G0846 concerning G4012 their G0846 brother G0080.
011:020 Then G3767 Martha G3136, as soon as G5613 she heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G3754 Jesus G2424 was coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), went and met G5221 (AorActInd) him G0846: but G1161 Mary G3137 sat G2516 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) [still] in G1722 the house G3624.
011:021 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Martha G3136 unto G4314 Jesus G2424, Lord G2962, if G1487 thou hadst been G2258 (ImpfInd) here G5602, my G3450 brother G0080 G0302 had G2348 not G3756 died G2348 (PlupfActInd).
011:022 But G0235 I know G1492 (PerfActInd), that even G2532 now G3568, whatsoever G3754 G3745 G0302 thou wilt ask G0154 (AorMidSubj) of God G2316, God G2316 will give G1325 (FutActInd) [it] thee G4671.
011:023 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Thy G4675 brother G0080 shall rise again G0450 (FutMidInd).
011:024 Martha G3136 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, I know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 he shall rise again G0450 (FutMidInd) in G1722 the resurrection G0386 at G1722 the last G2078 day G2250.
011:025 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the resurrection G0386, and G2532 the life G2222: he that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) in G1519 me G1691, though G2579 he were dead G0599 (Aor2ActSubj), yet shall he live G2198 (FutMidDepInd):
011:026 And G2532 whosoever G3956 liveth G2198 (PresActPtc) and G2532 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) in G1519 me G1691 shall G0599 never G3364 G1519 G0165 die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj). Believest thou G4100 (PresActInd) this G5124?
011:027 She saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Yea G3483, Lord G2962: I G1473 believe G4100 (PerfActInd) that G3754 thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) the Christ G5547, the Son G5207 of God G2316, which G3588 should come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 the world G2889.
011:028 And G2532 when she had G2036 so G5023 said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), she went her way G0565 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 called G5455 (AorActInd) Mary G3137 her G0846 sister G0079 secretly G2977, saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), The Master G1320 is come G3918 (PresInd), and G2532 calleth for G5455 (PresActInd) thee G4571.
011:029 As soon as G5613 she G1565 heard G0191 (AorActInd) [that], she arose G1453 (PresPasInd) quickly G5035, and G2532 came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846.
011:030 Now G1161 Jesus G2424 was G2064 not yet G3768 come G2064 (PlupfActInd) into G1519 the town G2968, but G0235 was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 that place G5117 where G3699 Martha G3136 met G5221 (AorActInd) him G0846.
011:031 The Jews G2453 then G3767 which G3588 were G5607 (PresPtc) with G3326 her G0846 in G1722 the house G3614, and G2532 comforted G3888 (PresMidPasDepPtc) her G0846, when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) Mary G3137, that G3754 she rose up G0450 (Aor2ActInd) hastily G5030 and G2532 went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd), followed G0190 (AorActInd) her G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 She goeth G5217 (PresActInd) unto G1519 the grave G3419 to G2443 weep G2799 (AorActSubj) there G1563.
011:032 Then G3767 when G5613 Mary G3137 was come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) where G3699 Jesus G2424 was G2258 (ImpfInd), and saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, she fell down G4098 (Aor2ActInd) at G1519 his G0846 feet G4228, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, if G1487 thou hadst been G2258 (ImpfInd) here G5602, my G3450 brother G0080 had G0302 not G3756 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd).
011:033 When G5613 Jesus G2424 therefore G3767 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846 weeping G2799 (PresActPtc), and G2532 the Jews G2453 also weeping G2799 (PresActPtc) which came G4905 (Aor2ActPtc) with her G0846, he groaned G1690 (AorMidDepInd) in the spirit G4151, and G2532 was troubled G5015 (AorActInd) G1438,
011:034 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Where G4226 have ye laid G5087 (PerfActInd) him G0846? They said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) and G2532 see G1492 (AorActImpr).
011:035 Jesus G2424 wept G1145 (AorActInd).
011:036 Then G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) the Jews G2453, Behold G2396 how G4459 he loved G5368 (ImpfActInd) him G0846!
011:037 And G1161 some G5100 of G1537 them G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) not G3756 this man G3778, which G3588 opened G0455 (AorActPtc) the eyes G3788 of the blind G5185, have caused G4160 (AorActInf) that G2443 even G2532 this man G3778 should G0599 not G3361 have died G0599 (Aor2ActSubj)?
011:038 Jesus G2424 therefore G3767 again G3825 groaning G1690 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 himself G1438 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G1519 the grave G3419. G1161 It was G2258 (ImpfInd) a cave G4693, and G2532 a stone G3037 lay G1945 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) upon G1909 it G0846.
011:039 Jesus G2424 said G3004 (PresActInd), Take ye away G0142 (AorActImpr) the stone G3037. Martha G3136, the sister G0079 of him that was dead G2348 (PerfActPtc), saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, by this time G2235 he stinketh G3605 (PresActInd): for G1063 he hath been G2076 (PresInd) [dead] four days G5066.
011:040 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Said I G2036 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 unto thee G4671, that G3754, if G1437 thou wouldest believe G4100 (AorActSubj), thou shouldest see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) the glory G1391 of God G2316?
011:041 Then G3767 they took away G0142 (AorActInd) the stone G3037 [from the place] where G3757 the dead G2348 (PerfActPtc) was G2258 (ImpfInd) laid G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc). And G1161 Jesus G2424 lifted G0142 (AorActInd) up G0507 [his] eyes G3788, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Father G3962, I thank G2168 (PresActInd) thee G4671 that G3754 thou hast heard G0191 (AorActInd) me G3450.
011:042 And G1161 I G1473 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) that G3754 thou hearest G0191 (PresActInd) me G3450 always G3842: but G0235 because G1223 of the people G3793 which G3588 stand by G4026 (PerfActPtc) I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) [it], that G2443 they may believe G4100 (AorActSubj) that G3754 thou G4771 hast sent G0649 (AorActInd) me G3165.
011:043 And G2532 when he thus G5023 had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), he cried G2905 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, Lazarus G2976, come G1204 (Impr) forth G1854.
011:044 And G2532 he that was dead G2348 (PerfActPtc) came forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd), bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) hand G5495 and G2532 foot G4228 with graveclothes G2750: and G2532 his G0846 face G3799 was bound about G4019 (PlupfPasInd) with a napkin G4676. Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Loose G3089 (AorActImpr) him G0846, and G2532 let him G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) go G5217 (PresActInf).
011:045 Then G3767 many G4183 of G1537 the Jews G2453 which G3588 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G4314 Mary G3137, and G2532 had seen G2300 (AorMidDepPtc) the things which G3739 Jesus G2424 did G4160 (AorActInd), believed G4100 (AorActInd) on G1519 him G0846.
011:046 But G1161 some G5100 of G1537 them G0846 went their ways G0565 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 the Pharisees G5330, and G2532 told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 what things G3739 Jesus G2424 had done G4160 (AorActInd).
011:047 Then G3767 gathered G4863 (Aor2ActInd) the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the Pharisees G5330 a council G4892, and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), What G5101 do we G4160 (PresActInd)? for G3754 this G3778 man G0444 doeth G4160 (PresActInd) many G4183 miracles G4592.
011:048 If G1437 we let G0863 him G0846 thus G3779 alone G0863 (Aor2ActSubj), all G3956 [men] will believe G4100 (FutActInd) on G1519 him G0846: and G2532 the Romans G4514 shall come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) and G2532 take away G0142 (FutActInd) both G2532 our G2257 place G5117 and G2532 nation G1484.
011:049 And G1161 one G1520 G5100 of G1537 them G0846, [named] Caiaphas G2533, being G5607 (PresPtc) the high priest G0749 that same G1565 year G1763, said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Ye G5210 know G1492 (PerfActInd) nothing at all G3756 G3762,
011:050 Nor G3761 consider G1260 (PresMidPasDepInd) that G3754 it is expedient G4851 (PresActInd) for us G2254, that G2443 one G1520 man G0444 should die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj) for G5228 the people G2992, and G2532 that the whole G3650 nation G1484 perish G0622 (Aor2MidSubj) not G3361.
011:051 And G1161 this G5124 spake he G2036 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 of G0575 himself G1438: but G0235 being G5607 (PresPtc) high priest G0749 that G1565 year G1763, he prophesied G4395 (AorActInd) that G3754 Jesus G2424 should G3195 (ImpfActInd) die G0599 (PresActInf) for that G5228 nation G1484;
011:052 And G2532 not G3756 for that G5228 nation G1484 only G3440, but G0235 that G2443 also G2532 he should gather together G4863 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1519 one G1520 the children G5043 of God G2316 that were scattered abroad G1287 (PerfPasPtc).
011:053 Then G3767 from G0575 that G1565 day G2250 forth they took counsel together G4823 (AorMidInd) for to G2443 put G0615 him G0846 to death G0615 (PresActSubj).
011:054 Jesus G2424 therefore G3767 walked G4043 (ImpfActInd) no more G3765 openly G3954 among G1722 the Jews G2453; but G0235 went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) thence G1564 unto G1519 a country G5561 near G1451 to the wilderness G2048, into G1519 a city G4172 called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Ephraim G2187, and there G2546 continued G1304 (ImpfActInd) with G3326 his G0846 disciples G3101.
011:055 And G1161 the Jews G2453 ’ passover G3957 was G2258 (ImpfInd) nigh at hand G1451: and G2532 many G4183 went G0305 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the country G5561 up G1519 to Jerusalem G2414 before G4253 the passover G3957, to G2443 purify G0048 (AorActSubj) themselves G1438.
011:056 Then G3767 sought they for G2212 (ImpfActInd) Jesus G2424, and G2532 spake G3004 (ImpfActInd) among G3326 themselves G0240, as they stood G2476 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, What G5101 think G1380 (PresActInd) ye G5213, that G3754 he will G2064 not G3364 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) to G1519 the feast G1859?
011:057 Now G1161 both G2532 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the Pharisees G5330 had given G1325 (PlupfActInd) a commandment G1785, that G2443, if G1437 any man G5100 knew G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) where G4226 he were G2076 (PresInd), he should shew G3377 (AorActSubj) [it], that G3704 they might take G4084 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
012:001 ¶  Then G3767 Jesus G2424 six G1803 days G2250 before G4253 the passover G3957 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Bethany G0963, where G3699 Lazarus G2976 was G2258 (ImpfInd) which G3588 had been dead G2348 (PerfActPtc), whom G3739 he raised G1453 (AorActInd) from G1537 the dead G3498.
012:002 There G1563 G3767 they made G4160 (AorActInd) him G0846 a supper G1173; and G2532 Martha G3136 served G1247 (ImpfActInd): but G1161 Lazarus G2976 was G2258 (ImpfInd) one G1520 of them that sat at the table G4873 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with him G0846.
012:003 Then G3767 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) Mary G3137 a pound G3046 of ointment G3464 of spikenard G3487 G4101, very costly G4186, and anointed G0218 (AorActInd) the feet G4228 of Jesus G2424, and G2532 wiped G1591 (AorActInd) his G0846 feet G4228 with her G0846 hair G2359: and G1161 the house G3614 was filled G4137 (AorPasInd) with G1537 the odour G3744 of the ointment G3464.
012:004 Then G3767 saith G3004 (PresActInd) one G1520 of G1537 his G0846 disciples G3101, Judas G2455 Iscariot G2469, Simon’s G4613 [son], which G3588 should G3195 (PresActPtc) betray G3860 (PresActInf) him G0846,
012:005 Why G1302 was G4097 not G3756 this G5124 ointment G3464 sold G4097 (AorPasInd) for three hundred G5145 pence G1220, and G2532 given G1325 (AorPasInd) to the poor G4434?
012:006 G1161 This G5124 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), not G3756 that G3754 he G0846 cared G3199 (ImpfActInd) for G4012 the poor G4434; but G0235 because G3754 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) a thief G2812, and G2532 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) the bag G1101, and G2532 bare G0941 (ImpfActInd) what was put therein G0906 (PresPasPtc).
012:007 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424, Let G0863 her G0846 alone G0863 (Aor2ActImpr): against G1519 the day G2250 of my G3450 burying G1780 hath she kept G5083 (PerfActInd) this G0846.
012:008 For G1063 the poor G4434 always G3842 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) with G3326 you G1438; but G1161 me G1691 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 always G3842.
012:009 Much G4183 people G3793 of G1537 the Jews G2453 therefore G3767 knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 he was G2076 (PresInd) there G1563: and G2532 they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 for G1223 Jesus G2424 ’ sake only G3440, but G0235 that G2443 they might see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) Lazarus G2976 also G2532, whom G3739 he had raised G1453 (AorActInd) from G1537 the dead G3498.
012:010 But G1161 the chief priests G0749 consulted G1011 (AorMidDepInd) that G2443 they might put G0615 Lazarus G2976 also G2532 to death G0615 (PresActSubj);
012:011 Because G3754 that by reason G1223 of him G0846 many G4183 of the Jews G2453 went away G5217 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 believed G4100 (ImpfActInd) on G1519 Jesus G2424.
012:012 On the next day G1887 much G4183 people G3793 that were come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 the feast G1859, when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 Jesus G2424 was coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414,
012:013 Took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) branches G0902 of palm trees G5404, and G2532 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 meet G5222 him G0846, and G2532 cried G2896 (ImpfActInd), Hosanna G5614: Blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [is] the King G0935 of Israel G2474 that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962.
012:014 And G1161 Jesus G2424, when he had found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) a young ass G3678, sat G2523 (AorActInd) thereon G1909 G0846; as G2531 it is G2076 (PresInd) written G1125 (PerfPasPtc),
012:015 Fear G5399 (PresMidImpr/PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361, daughter G2364 of Sion G4622: behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), thy G4675 King G0935 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 an ass’s G3688 colt G4454.
012:016 G1161 These things G5023 understood G1097 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 his G0846 disciples G3101 at the first G4412: but G0235 when G3753 Jesus G2424 was glorified G1392 (AorPasInd), then G5119 remembered they G3415 (AorPasInd) that G3754 these things G5023 were G2258 (ImpfInd) written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) of G1909 him G0846, and G2532 [that] they had done G4160 (AorActInd) these things G5023 unto him G0846.
012:017 The people G3793 therefore G3767 that was G5607 (PresPtc) with G3326 him G0846 when G3753 he called G5455 (AorActInd) Lazarus G2976 out of G1537 his grave G3419, and G2532 raised G1453 (AorActInd) him G0846 from G1537 the dead G3498, bare record G3140 (ImpfActInd).
012:018 For this G5124 cause G1223 the people G3793 also G2532 met G5221 (AorActInd) him G0846, for that G3754 they heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G0846 he had done G4160 (PerfActInf) this G5124 miracle G4592.
012:019 The Pharisees G5330 therefore G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) among G4314 themselves G1438, Perceive ye G2334 (PresActInd/PresActImpr) how G3754 ye prevail G5623 (PresActInd) nothing G3756 G3762? behold G2396, the world G2889 is gone G0565 (Aor2ActInd) after G3694 him G0846.
012:020 And G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) certain G5100 Greeks G1672 among G1537 them that came up G0305 (PresActPtc) to G2443 worship G4352 (AorActSubj) at G1722 the feast G1859:
012:021 The same G3778 came G4334 (AorActInd) therefore G3767 to Philip G5376, which was of G0575 Bethsaida G0966 of Galilee G1056, and G2532 desired G2065 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Sir G2962, we would G2309 (PresActInd) see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) Jesus G2424.
012:022 Philip G5376 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) and G2532 telleth G3004 (PresActInd) Andrew G0406: and G2532 again G3825 Andrew G0406 and G2532 Philip G5376 tell G3004 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424.
012:023 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), The hour G5610 is come G2064 (Perf2ActInd), that G2443 the Son G5207 of man G0444 should be glorified G1392 (AorPasSubj).
012:024 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Except G3362 a corn G2848 of wheat G4621 fall G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the ground G1093 and die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj), it G0846 abideth G3306 (PresActInd) alone G3441: but G1161 if G1437 it die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj), it bringeth forth G5342 (PresActInd) much G4183 fruit G2590.
012:025 He that loveth G5368 (PresActPtc) his G0846 life G5590 shall lose G0622 (FutActInd) it G0846; and G2532 he that hateth G3404 (PresActPtc) his G0846 life G5590 in G1722 this G5129 world G2889 shall keep G5442 (FutActInd) it G0846 unto G1519 life G2222 eternal G0166.
012:026 If G1437 any man G5100 serve G1247 (PresActSubj) me G1698, let him follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G1698; and G2532 where G3699 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd), there G1563 shall G2071 also G2532 my G1699 servant G1249 be G2071 (FutInd): G2532 if G1437 any man G5100 serve G1247 (PresActSubj) me G1698, him G0846 will G5091 [my] Father G3962 honour G5091 (FutActInd).
012:027 Now G3568 is G5015 my G3450 soul G5590 troubled G5015 (PerfPasInd); and G2532 what G5101 shall I say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj)? Father G3962, save G4982 (AorActImpr) me G3165 from G1537 this G5026 hour G5610: but G0235 for this G5124 cause G1223 came I G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 this G5026 hour G5610.
012:028 Father G3962, glorify G1392 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 name G3686. Then G3767 came there G2064 (Aor2ActInd) a voice G5456 from G1537 heaven G3772, [saying], I have G1392 both G2532 glorified G1392 (AorActInd) [it], and G2532 will glorify G1392 (FutActInd) [it] again G3825.
012:029 The people G3793 therefore G3767, that stood by G2476 (PerfActPtc), and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], said G3004 (ImpfActInd) that it thundered G1096 (Perf2ActInf) G1027: others G0243 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), An angel G0032 spake G2980 (PerfActInd) to him G0846.
012:030 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), This G3778 voice G5456 came G1096 (Perf2ActInd) not G3756 because of G1223 me G1691, but G0235 for G1223 your sakes G5209 G1223.
012:031 Now G3568 is G2076 (PresInd) the judgment G2920 of this G5127 world G2889: now G3568 shall G1544 the prince G0758 of this G5127 world G2889 be cast G1544 (FutPasInd) out G1854.
012:032 And I G2504, if G1437 I be lifted up G5312 (AorPasSubj) from G1537 the earth G1093, will draw G1670 (FutActInd) all G3956 [men] unto G4314 me G1683.
012:033 G1161 This G5124 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd), signifying G4591 (PresActPtc) what G4169 death G2288 he should G3195 (ImpfActInd) die G0599 (PresActInf).
012:034 The people G3793 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, We G2249 have heard G0191 (AorActInd) out of G1537 the law G3551 that G3754 Christ G5547 abideth G3306 (PresActInd) for G1519 ever G0165: and G2532 how G4459 sayest G3004 (PresActInd) thou G4771, G3754 The Son G5207 of man G0444 must G1163 (PresInd) be lifted up G5312 (AorPasInf)? who G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778 Son G5207 of man G0444?
012:035 Then G3767 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Yet G2089 a little G3398 while G5550 is G2076 (PresInd) the light G5457 with G3326 you G5216. Walk G4043 (PresActImpr) while G2193 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) the light G5457, lest G3363 darkness G4653 come upon G2638 (Aor2ActSubj) you G5209: for G2532 he that walketh G4043 (PresActPtc) in G1722 darkness G4653 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 whither G4226 he goeth G5217 (PresActInd).
012:036 While G2193 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) light G5457, believe G4100 (PresActImpr) in G1519 the light G5457, that G2443 ye may be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) the children G5207 of light G5457. These things G5023 spake G2980 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424, and departed G0565 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 did hide himself G2928 (Aor2PasDepSubj) from G0575 them G0846.
012:037 But G1161 though he G0846 had done G4160 (PerfActPtc) so many G5118 miracles G4592 before G1715 them G0846, yet they believed G4100 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 on G1519 him G0846:
012:038 That G2443 the saying G3056 of Esaias G2268 the prophet G4396 might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj), which G3739 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, who G5101 hath believed G4100 (AorActInd) our G2257 report G0189? and G2532 to whom G5101 hath the arm G1023 of the Lord G2962 been revealed G0601 (AorPasInd)?
012:039 Therefore G5124 G1223 they could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) not G3756 believe G4100 (PresActInf), because G3754 that Esaias G2268 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825,
012:040 He hath blinded G5186 (PerfActInd) their G0846 eyes G3788, and G2532 hardened G4456 (PerfActInd) their G0846 heart G2588; that G3363 they should G1492 not G3363 see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) with [their] eyes G3788, nor G2532 understand G3539 (AorActSubj) with [their] heart G2588, and G2532 be converted G1994 (Aor2PasSubj), and G2532 I should heal G2390 (AorMidDepSubj) them G0846.
012:041 These things G5023 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Esaias G2268, when G3753 he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 glory G1391, and G2532 spake G2980 (AorActInd) of G4012 him G0846.
012:042 Nevertheless G3676 G3305 among G1537 the chief rulers G0758 also G2532 many G4183 believed G4100 (AorActInd) on G1519 him G0846; but G0235 because G1223 of the Pharisees G5330 they did G3670 not G3756 confess G3670 (ImpfActInd) [him], lest G3363 they should be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) put out of the synagogue G0656:
012:043 For G1063 they loved G0025 (AorActInd) the praise G1391 of men G0444 more G3123 than G2260 the praise G1391 of God G2316.
012:044 G1161 Jesus G2424 cried G2896 (AorActInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), He that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 me G1691, believeth G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756 on G1519 me G1691, but G0235 on G1519 him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
012:045 And G2532 he that seeth G2334 (PresActPtc) me G1691 seeth G2334 (PresActInd) him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
012:046 I G1473 am come G2064 (Perf2ActInd) a light G5457 into G1519 the world G2889, that G3363 whosoever G3956 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 me G1691 should G3306 not G3363 abide G3306 (AorActSubj) in G1722 darkness G4653.
012:047 And G2532 if G3362 any man G5100 hear G0191 (AorActSubj) my G3450 words G4487, and G2532 believe G4100 (AorActSubj) not G3362, I G1473 judge G2919 (FutActInd/PresActInd) him G0846 not G3756: for G1063 I came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 to G2443 judge G2919 (PresActSubj) the world G2889, but G0235 to G2443 save G4982 (AorActSubj) the world G2889.
012:048 He that rejecteth G0114 (PresActPtc) me G1691, and G2532 receiveth G2983 (PresActPtc) not G3361 my G3450 words G4487, hath G2192 (PresActInd) one that judgeth G2919 (PresActPtc) him G0846: the word G3056 that G3739 I have spoken G2980 (AorActInd), the same G1565 shall judge G2919 (FutActInd) him G0846 in G1722 the last G2078 day G2250.
012:049 For G3754 I G1473 have G2980 not G3756 spoken G2980 (AorActInd) of G1537 myself G1683; but G0235 the Father G3962 which sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165, he G0846 gave G1325 (AorActInd) me G3427 a commandment G1785, what G5101 I should say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), and G2532 what G5101 I should speak G2980 (AorActSubj).
012:050 And G2532 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 his G0846 commandment G1785 is G2076 (PresInd) life G2222 everlasting G0166: whatsoever G3739 I G1473 speak G2980 (PresActInd) therefore G3767, even as G2531 the Father G3962 said G2046 (PerfActInd) unto me G3427, so G3779 I speak G2980 (PresActInd).
013:001 ¶  Now G1161 before G4253 the feast G1859 of the passover G3957, when Jesus G2424 knew G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 his G0846 hour G5610 was come G2064 (Perf2ActInd) that G2443 he should depart G3327 (Aor2ActSubj) out of G1537 this G5127 world G2889 unto G4314 the Father G3962, having loved G0025 (AorActPtc) his own G2398 which G3588 were in G1722 the world G2889, he loved G0025 (AorActInd) them G0846 unto G1519 the end G5056.
013:002 And G2532 supper G1173 being ended G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), the devil G1228 having now G2235 put G0906 (PerfActPtc) into G1519 the heart G2588 of Judas G2455 Iscariot G2469, Simon’s G4613 [son], to G2443 betray G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) him G0846;
013:003 Jesus G2424 knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 the Father G3962 had given G1325 (PerfActInd) all things G3956 into G1519 his G0846 hands G5495, and G2532 that G3754 he was come G1831 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 God G2316, and G2532 went G5217 (PresActInd) to G4314 God G2316;
013:004 He riseth G1453 (PresPasInd) from G1537 supper G1173, and G2532 laid aside G5087 (PresActInd) his garments G2440; and G2532 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) a towel G3012, and girded G1241 (AorActInd) himself G1438.
013:005 After that G1534 he poureth G0906 (PresActInd) water G5204 into G1519 a bason G3537, and G2532 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to wash G3538 (PresActInf) the disciples G3101 ’ feet G4228, and G2532 to wipe G1591 (PresActInf) [them] with the towel G3012 wherewith G3739 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) girded G1241 (PerfPasPtc).
013:006 Then G3767 cometh he G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 Simon G4613 Peter G4074: and G2532 Peter G1565 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, dost G3538 thou G4771 wash G3538 (PresActInd) my G3450 feet G4228?
013:007 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, What G3739 I G1473 do G4160 (PresActInd) thou G4771 knowest G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 now G0737; but G1161 thou shalt know G1097 (FutMidDepInd) hereafter G3326 G5023.
013:008 Peter G4074 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Thou shalt G3538 never G1519 G0165 G3364 wash G3538 (AorActSubj) my G3450 feet G4228. Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, If G3362 I wash G3538 (AorActSubj) thee G4571 not G3362, thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 part G3313 with G3326 me G1700.
013:009 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, not G3361 my G3450 feet G4228 only G3440, but G0235 also G2532 [my] hands G5495 and G2532 [my] head G2776.
013:010 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) to him G0846, He that is washed G3068 (PerfPasPtc) needeth G5532 not G3756 G2192 (PresActInd) save G2228 to wash G3538 (AorMidInf) [his] feet G4228, but G0235 is G2076 (PresInd) clean G2513 every whit G3650: and G2532 ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) clean G2513, but G0235 not G3780 all G3956.
013:011 For G1063 he knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) who G3588 should betray G3860 (PresActPtc) him G0846; therefore G5124 G1223 said he G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Ye are G2075 (PresInd) not G3780 all G3956 clean G2513.
013:012 So G3767 after G3753 he had washed G3538 (AorActInd) their G0846 feet G4228, and G2532 had taken G2983 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 garments G2440, and was set down G0377 (Aor2ActPtc) again G3825, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Know ye G1097 (PresActInd/PresActImpr) what G5101 I have done G4160 (PerfActInd) to you G5213?
013:013 Ye G5210 call G5455 (PresActInd) me G3165 Master G1320 and G2532 Lord G2962: and G2532 ye say G3004 (PresActInd) well G2573; for G1063 [so] I am G1510 (PresInd).
013:014 If G1487 I G1473 then G3767, [your] Lord G2962 and G2532 Master G1320, have washed G3538 (AorActInd) your G5216 feet G4228; ye G5210 also G2532 ought G3784 (PresActInd) to wash G3538 (PresActInf) one another’s G0240 feet G4228.
013:015 For G1063 I have given G1325 (AorActInd) you G5213 an example G5262, that G2443 ye G5210 should do G4160 (PresActSubj) as G2531 G2532 I G1473 have done G4160 (AorActInd) to you G5213.
013:016 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, The servant G1401 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 greater than G3187 his G0846 lord G2962; neither G3761 he that is sent G0652 greater than G3187 he that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) him G0846.
013:017 If G1487 ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) these things G5023, happy G3107 are ye G2075 (PresInd) if G1437 ye do G4160 (PresActSubj) them G0846.
013:018 I speak G3004 (PresActInd) not G3756 of G4012 you G5216 all G3956: I G1473 know G1492 (PerfActInd) whom G3739 I have chosen G1586 (AorMidInd): but G0235 that G2443 the scripture G1124 may be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj), He that eateth G5176 (PresActPtc) bread G0740 with G3326 me G1700 hath lifted up G1869 (AorActInd) his G0846 heel G4418 against G1909 me G1691.
013:019 Now G0575 G0737 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213 before G4253 it come G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf), that G2443, when G3752 it is come to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj), ye may believe G4100 (AorActSubj) that G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) [he].
013:020 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, He that receiveth G2983 (PresActPtc) whomsoever G1437 G5100 I send G3992 (AorActSubj) receiveth G2983 (PresActInd) me G1691; and G1161 he that receiveth G2983 (PresActPtc) me G1691 receiveth G2983 (PresActInd) him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
013:021 When Jesus G2424 had G2036 thus G5023 said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), he was troubled G5015 (AorPasInd) in spirit G4151, and G2532 testified G3140 (AorActInd), and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 one G1520 of G1537 you G5216 shall betray G3860 (FutActInd) me G3165.
013:022 Then G3767 the disciples G3101 looked G0991 (ImpfActInd) one on another G1519 G0240, doubting G0639 (PresMidPtc) of G4012 whom G5101 he spake G3004 (PresActInd).
013:023 Now G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) leaning G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1722 Jesus G2424 ’ bosom G2859 one G1520 of his G0846 disciples G3101, whom G3739 Jesus G2424 loved G0025 (ImpfActInd).
013:024 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 therefore G3767 beckoned G3506 (PresActInd) to him G5129, that he should ask G4441 (Aor2MidDepInf) who G5101 it should G0302 be G1498 (PresOpt) of G4012 whom G3739 he spake G3004 (PresActInd).
013:025 He G1565 then G1161 lying on G1968 (Aor2ActPtc) G1909 Jesus G2424 ’ breast G4738 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, who G5101 is it G2076 (PresInd)?
013:026 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (PresMidPasDepInd), He G1565 it is G2076 (PresInd), to whom G3739 I shall give G1929 (FutActInd) a sop G5596, when I G1473 have dipped G0911 (AorActPtc) [it]. And G2532 when he had dipped G1686 (AorActPtc) the sop G5596, he gave G1325 (PresActInd) [it] to Judas G2455 Iscariot G2469, [the son] of Simon G4613.
013:027 And G2532 after G3326 the sop G5596 G5119 Satan G4567 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 him G1565. Then G3767 said G3004 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 unto him G0846, That G3739 thou doest G4160 (PresActInd), do G4160 (AorActImpr) quickly G5032.
013:028 Now G1161 no man G3762 at the table G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc) knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) for what G4314 intent G5101 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) this G5124 unto him G0846.
013:029 For G1063 some G5100 [of them] thought G1380 (ImpfActInd), because G1893 Judas G2455 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) the bag G1101, that G3754 Jesus G2424 had said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Buy G0059 (AorActImpr) [those things] that G3739 we have G2192 (PresActInd) need of G5532 against G1519 the feast G1859; or G2228, that G2443 he should give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) something G5100 to the poor G4434.
013:030 He G1565 then G3767 having received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the sop G5596 went G1831 immediately G2112 out G1831 (Aor2ActInd): and G1161 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) night G3571.
013:031 Therefore G3767, when G3753 he was gone out G1831 (Aor2ActInd), Jesus G2424 said G3004 (PresActInd), Now G3568 is G1392 the Son G5207 of man G0444 glorified G1392 (AorPasInd), and G2532 God G2316 is glorified G1392 (AorPasInd) in G1722 him G0846.
013:032 If G1487 God G2316 be glorified G1392 (AorPasInd) in G1722 him G0846, God G2316 shall G1392 also G2532 glorify G1392 (FutActInd) him G0846 in G1722 himself G1438, and G2532 shall G1392 straightway G2117 glorify G1392 (FutActInd) him G0846.
013:033 Little children G5040, yet G2089 a little while G3397 I am G1510 (PresInd) with G3326 you G5216. Ye shall seek G2212 (FutActInd) me G3165: and G2532 as G2531 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the Jews G2453, G3754 Whither G3699 I G1473 go G5217 (PresActInd), ye G5210 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf); so G2532 now G0737 I say G3004 (PresActInd) to you G5213.
013:034 A new G2537 commandment G1785 I give G1325 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G2443 ye love G0025 (PresActSubj) one another G0240; as G2531 I have loved G0025 (AorActInd) you G5209, that G2443 ye G5210 also G2532 love G0025 (PresActSubj) one another G0240.
013:035 By G1722 this G5129 shall G1097 all G3956 [men] know G1097 (FutMidDepInd) that G3754 ye are G2075 (PresInd) my G1699 disciples G3101, if G1437 ye have G2192 (PresActSubj) love G0026 one to another G1722 G0240.
013:036 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, whither G4226 goest G5217 (PresActInd) thou? Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, Whither G3699 I go G5217 (PresActInd), thou canst G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 follow G0190 (AorActInf) me G3427 now G3568; but G1161 thou shalt follow G0190 (FutActInd) me G3427 afterwards G5305.
013:037 Peter G4074 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, why G1302 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) I follow G0190 (AorActInf) thee G4671 now G0737? I will lay down G5087 (FutActInd) my G3450 life G5590 for G5228 thy sake G4675.
013:038 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, Wilt thou lay down G5087 (FutActInd) thy G4675 life G5590 for G5228 my sake G1700? Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, The cock G0220 shall G5455 not G3364 crow G5455 (FutActInd), till G2193 G3739 thou hast denied G0533 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165 thrice G5151.
014:001 ¶  Let G5015 not G3361 your G5216 heart G2588 be troubled G5015 (PresPasImpr): ye believe G4100 (PresActInd/PresActImpr) in G1519 God G2316, believe G4100 (PresActInd/PresActImpr) also G2532 in G1519 me G1691.
014:002 In G1722 my G3450 Father’s G3962 house G3614 are G1526 (PresInd) many G4183 mansions G3438: if [it were] not G1490 [so], I would have told G0302 G2036 (Aor2ActInd) you G5213. I go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd) to prepare G2090 (AorActInf) a place G5117 for you G5213.
014:003 And G2532 if G1437 I go G4198 (AorPasDepSubj) and G2532 prepare G2090 (AorActSubj) a place G5117 for you G5213, I will come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) again G3825, and G2532 receive G3880 (FutMidDepInd) you G5209 unto G4314 myself G1683; that G2443 where G3699 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd), [there] ye G5210 may be G5600 (PresSubj) also G2532.
014:004 And G2532 whither G3699 I G1473 go G5217 (PresActInd) ye know G1492 (PerfActInd), and G2532 the way G3598 ye know G1492 (PerfActInd).
014:005 Thomas G2381 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, we know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 whither G4226 thou goest G5217 (PresActInd); and G2532 how G4459 can we G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) know G1492 (PerfActInf) the way G3598?
014:006 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the way G3598, G2532 the truth G0225, and G2532 the life G2222: no man G3762 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 the Father G3962, but G1508 by G1223 me G1700.
014:007 If G1487 ye had known G1097 (PlupfActInd) me G3165, G0302 ye should have known G1097 (PlupfActInd) my G3450 Father G3962 also G2532: and G2532 from G0575 henceforth G0737 ye know G1097 (PresActInd) him G0846, and G2532 have seen G3708 (PerfActInd) him G0846.
014:008 Philip G5376 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, shew G1166 (AorActImpr) us G2254 the Father G3962, and G2532 it sufficeth G0714 (PresActInd) us G2254.
014:009 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Have I been G1510 (PresInd) so long G5118 time G5550 with G3326 you G5216, and yet G2532 hast thou G1097 not G3756 known G1097 (PerfActInd) me G3165, Philip G5376? he that hath seen G3708 (PerfActPtc) me G1691 hath seen G3708 (PerfActInd) the Father G3962; and G2532 how G4459 sayest G3004 (PresActInd) thou G4771 [then], Shew G1166 (AorActImpr) us G2254 the Father G3962?
014:010 Believest thou G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756 that G3754 I G1473 am G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 the Father G3962, and G2532 the Father G3962 in G1722 me G1698? the words G4487 that G3739 I G1473 speak G2980 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 I speak G2980 (PresActInd) not G3756 of G0575 myself G1683: but G1161 the Father G3962 that dwelleth G3306 (PresActPtc) in G1722 me G1698, he G0846 doeth G4160 (PresActInd) the works G2041.
014:011 Believe G4100 (PresActImpr) me G3427 that G3754 I G1473 [am] in G1722 the Father G3962, and G2532 the Father G3962 in G1722 me G1698: or else G1490 believe G4100 (PresActImpr) me G3427 for G1223 the very G0846 works G2041 ’ sake G0846.
014:012 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, He that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1519 me G1691, the works G2041 that G3739 I G1473 do G4160 (PresActInd) shall he do G4160 (FutActInd) also G2548; and G2532 greater [works] than G3187 these G5130 shall he do G4160 (FutActInd); because G3754 I G1473 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 my G3450 Father G3962.
014:013 And G3739 G2532 whatsoever G3748 G0302 ye shall ask G0154 (AorActSubj) in G1722 my G3450 name G3686, that G5124 will I do G4160 (FutActInd), that G2443 the Father G3962 may be glorified G1392 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 the Son G5207.
014:014 If G1437 ye shall ask G0154 (AorActSubj) any thing G5100 in G1722 my G3450 name G3686, I G1473 will do G4160 (FutActInd) [it].
014:015 If G1437 ye love G0025 (PresActSubj) me G3165, keep G5083 (AorActImpr) my G1699 commandments G1785.
014:016 And G2532 I G1473 will pray G2065 (FutActInd) the Father G3962, and G2532 he shall give G1325 (FutActInd) you G5213 another G0243 Comforter G3875, that G2443 he may abide G3306 (PresActSubj) with G3326 you G5216 for G1519 ever G0165;
014:017 [Even] the Spirit G4151 of truth G0225; whom G3739 the world G2889 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) receive G2983 (Aor2ActInf), because G3754 it seeth G2334 (PresActInd) him G0846 not G3756, neither G3761 knoweth G1097 (PresActInd) him G0846: but G1161 ye G5210 know G1097 (PresActInd) him G0846; for G3754 he dwelleth G3306 (PresActInd) with G3844 you G5213, and G2532 shall be G2071 (FutInd) in G1722 you G5213.
014:018 I will G0863 not G3756 leave G0863 (FutActInd) you G5209 comfortless G3737: I will come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 you G5209.
014:019 Yet G2089 a little while G3397, and G2532 the world G2889 seeth G2334 (PresActInd) me G3165 no more G3765; but G1161 ye G5210 see G2334 (PresActInd) me G3165: because G3754 I G1473 live G2198 (PresActInd), ye G5210 shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd) also G2532.
014:020 At G1722 that G1565 day G2250 ye G5210 shall know G1097 (FutMidDepInd) that G3754 I G1473 [am] in G1722 my G3450 Father G3962, and G2532 ye G5210 in G1722 me G1698, and I G2504 in G1722 you G5213.
014:021 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) my G3450 commandments G1785, and G2532 keepeth G5083 (PresActPtc) them G0846, he G1565 it is G2076 (PresInd) that loveth G0025 (PresActPtc) me G3165: and G1161 he that loveth G0025 (PresActPtc) me G3165 shall be loved G0025 (FutPasInd) of G5259 my G3450 Father G3962, and G2532 I G1473 will love G0025 (FutActInd) him G0846, and G2532 will manifest G1718 (FutActInd) myself G1683 to him G0846.
014:022 Judas G2455 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, not G3756 Iscariot G2469, Lord G2962, how G5101 is it G1096 (Perf2ActInd) that G3754 thou wilt G3195 (PresActInd) manifest G1718 (PresActInf) thyself G4572 unto us G2254, and G2532 not G3780 unto the world G2889?
014:023 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, If G1437 a man G5100 love G0025 (PresActSubj) me G3165, he will keep G5083 (FutActInd) my G3450 words G3056: and G2532 my G3450 Father G3962 will love G0025 (FutActInd) him G0846, and G2532 we will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846, and G2532 make G4160 (FutActInd) our abode G3438 with G3844 him G0846.
014:024 He that loveth G0025 (PresActPtc) me G3165 not G3361 keepeth G5083 (PresActInd) not G3756 my G3450 sayings G3056: and G2532 the word G3056 which G3739 ye hear G0191 (PresActInd) is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 mine G1699, but G0235 the Father’s G3962 which G3588 sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
014:025 These things G5023 have I spoken G2980 (PerfActInd) unto you G5213, being [yet] present G3306 (PresActPtc) with G3844 you G5213.
014:026 But G1161 the Comforter G3875, [which is] the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, whom G3739 the Father G3962 will send G3992 (FutActInd) in G1722 my G3450 name G3686, he G1565 shall teach G1321 (FutActInd) you G5209 all things G3956, and G2532 bring G5279 all things G3956 to G5279 your G5209 remembrance G5279 (FutActInd), whatsoever G3739 I have said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto you G5213.
014:027 Peace G1515 I leave G0863 (PresActInd) with you G5213, my G1699 peace G1515 I give G1325 (PresActInd) unto you G5213: not G3756 as G2531 the world G2889 giveth G1325 (PresActInd), give G1325 (PresActInd) I G1473 unto you G5213. Let G5015 not G3361 your G5216 heart G2588 be troubled G5015 (PresPasImpr), neither G3366 let it be afraid G1168 (PresActImpr).
014:028 Ye have heard G0191 (AorActInd) how G3754 I G1473 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto you G5213, I go away G5217 (PresActInd), and G2532 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) [again] unto G4314 you G5209. If G1487 ye loved G0025 (ImpfActInd) me G3165, G0302 ye would rejoice G5463 (Aor2PasDepInd), because G3754 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 the Father G3962: for G3754 my G3450 Father G3962 is G2076 (PresInd) greater than G3187 I G3450.
014:029 And G2532 now G3568 I have told G2046 (PerfActInd) you G5213 before G4250 it come to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf), that G2443, when G3752 it is come to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj), ye might believe G4100 (AorActSubj).
014:030 Hereafter G3765 I will G2980 not G3765 talk G2980 (FutActInd) much G4183 with G3326 you G5216: for G1063 the prince G0758 of this G5127 world G2889 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 hath G2192 (PresActInd) G3756 nothing G3762 in G1722 me G1698.
014:031 But G0235 that G2443 the world G2889 may know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) that G3754 I love G0025 (PresActInd) the Father G3962; and G2532 as G2531 the Father G3962 gave G1781 me G3427 commandment G1781 (AorMidDepInd), even so G3779 I do G4160 (PresActInd). Arise G1453 (PresMidPasImpr), let us go G0071 (PresActSubj) hence G1782.
015:001 ¶  I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the true G0228 vine G0288, and G2532 my G3450 Father G3962 is G2076 (PresInd) the husbandman G1092.
015:002 Every G3956 branch G2814 in G1722 me G1698 that G0846 beareth G5342 (PresActPtc) not G3361 fruit G2590 he taketh away G0142 (PresActInd): and G2532 every G3956 [branch] that beareth G5342 (PresActPtc) fruit G2590, he purgeth G2508 (PresActInd) it G0846, that G2443 it may bring forth G5342 (PresActSubj) more G4119 fruit G2590.
015:003 Now G2235 ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) clean G2513 through G1223 the word G3056 which G3739 I have spoken G2980 (PerfActInd) unto you G5213.
015:004 Abide G3306 (AorActImpr) in G1722 me G1698, and I G2504 in G1722 you G5213. As G2531 the branch G2814 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) bear G5342 (PresActInf) fruit G2590 of G0575 itself G1438, except G3362 it abide G3306 (AorActSubj) in G1722 the vine G0288; no more G3761 G3779 can ye G5210, except G3362 ye abide G3306 (AorActSubj) in G1722 me G1698.
015:005 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the vine G0288, ye G5210 [are] the branches G2814: He that abideth G3306 (PresActPtc) in G1722 me G1698, and I G2504 in G1722 him G0846, the same G3778 bringeth forth G5342 (PresActInd) much G4183 fruit G2590: for G3754 without G5565 me G1700 ye can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) do G4160 (PresActInf) nothing G3756 G3762.
015:006 If G3362 a man G5100 abide G3306 (AorActSubj) not G3362 in G1722 me G1698, he is cast G0906 (AorPasInd) forth G1854 as G5613 a branch G2814, and G2532 is withered G3583 (AorPasInd); and G2532 men gather G4863 (PresActInd) them G0846, and G2532 cast G0906 (PresActInd) [them] into G1519 the fire G4442, and G2532 they are burned G2545 (PresPasInd).
015:007 If G1437 ye abide G3306 (AorActSubj) in G1722 me G1698, and G2532 my G3450 words G4487 abide G3306 (AorActSubj) in G1722 you G5213, ye shall ask G0154 (FutMidInd) what G3739 G1437 ye will G2309 (PresActSubj), and G2532 it shall be done G1096 (FutMidDepInd) unto you G5213.
015:008 Herein G1722 G5129 is G1392 my G3450 Father G3962 glorified G1392 (AorPasInd), that G2443 ye bear G5342 (PresActSubj) much G4183 fruit G2590; so G2532 shall ye be G1096 (FutMidDepInd) my G1699 disciples G3101.
015:009 As G2531 the Father G3962 hath loved G0025 (AorActInd) me G3165, so G2504 have G0025 I G2504 loved G0025 (AorActInd) you G5209: continue ye G3306 (AorActImpr) in G1722 my G1699 love G0026.
015:010 If G1437 ye keep G5083 (AorActSubj) my G3450 commandments G1785, ye shall abide G3306 (FutActInd) in G1722 my G3450 love G0026; even as G2531 I G1473 have kept G5083 (PerfActInd) my G3450 Father’s G3962 commandments G1785, and G2532 abide G3306 (PresActInd) in G1722 his G0846 love G0026.
015:011 These things G5023 have I spoken G2980 (PerfActInd) unto you G5213, that G2443 my G1699 joy G5479 might remain G3306 (AorActSubj) in G1722 you G5213, and G2532 [that] your G5216 joy G5479 might be full G4137 (AorPasSubj).
015:012 This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) my G1699 commandment G1785, That G2443 ye love G0025 (PresActSubj) one another G0240, as G2531 I have loved G0025 (AorActInd) you G5209.
015:013 Greater G3187 love G0026 hath G2192 (PresActInd) no man G3762 than G3187 this G5026, that G2443 a man G5100 lay down G5087 (Aor2ActSubj) his G0846 life G5590 for G5228 his G0846 friends G5384.
015:014 Ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) my G3450 friends G5384, if G1437 ye do G4160 (PresActSubj) whatsoever G3745 I G1473 command G1781 (PresMidPasDepInd) you G5213.
015:015 Henceforth G3765 I call G3004 (PresActInd) you G5209 not G3765 servants G1401; for G3754 the servant G1401 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 his G0846 lord G2962 doeth G4160 (PresActInd): but G1161 I have called G2046 (PerfActInd) you G5209 friends G5384; for G3754 all things G3956 that G3739 I have heard G0191 (AorActInd) of G3844 my G3450 Father G3962 I have made known G1107 (AorActInd) unto you G5213.
015:016 Ye G5210 have G1586 not G3756 chosen G1586 (AorMidInd) me G3165, but G0235 I G1473 have chosen G1586 (AorMidInd) you G5209, and G2532 ordained G5087 (AorActInd) you G5209, that G2443 ye G5210 should go G5217 (PresActSubj) and G2532 bring forth G5342 (PresActSubj) fruit G2590, and G2532 [that] your G5216 fruit G2590 should remain G3306 (PresActSubj): that G2443 whatsoever G3739 G0302 G3748 ye shall ask G0154 (AorActSubj) of the Father G3962 in G1722 my G3450 name G3686, he may give it G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) you G5213.
015:017 These things G5023 I command G1781 (PresMidPasDepInd) you G5213, that G2443 ye love G0025 (PresActSubj) one another G0240.
015:018 If G1487 the world G2889 hate G3404 (PresActInd) you G5209, ye know G1097 (PresActInd/PresActImpr) that G3754 it hated G3404 (PerfActInd) me G1691 before G4412 [it hated] you G5216.
015:019 If G1487 ye were G2258 (ImpfInd) of G1537 the world G2889, the world G2889 would G0302 love G5368 (ImpfActInd) his own G2398: but G1161 because G3754 ye are G2075 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 the world G2889, but G0235 I G1473 have chosen G1586 (AorMidInd) you G5209 out of G1537 the world G2889, therefore G5124 G1223 the world G2889 hateth G3404 (PresActInd) you G5209.
015:020 Remember G3421 (PresActImpr) the word G3056 that G3739 I G1473 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto you G5213, The servant G1401 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 greater than G3187 his G0846 lord G2962. If G1487 they have persecuted G1377 (AorActInd) me G1691, they will G1377 also G2532 persecute G1377 (FutActInd) you G5209; if G1487 they have kept G5083 (AorActInd) my G3450 saying G3056, they will keep G5083 (FutActInd) yours G5212 also G2532.
015:021 But G0235 all G3956 these things G5023 will they do G4160 (FutActInd) unto you G5213 for G1223 my G3450 name’s G3686 sake G3450, because G3754 they know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
015:022 If G1508 I had G2064 not G1508 come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 spoken G2980 (AorActInd) unto them G0846, they had G2192 not G3756 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) sin G0266: but G1161 now G3568 they have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 cloke G4392 for G4012 their G0846 sin G0266.
015:023 He that hateth G3404 (PresActPtc) me G1691 hateth G3404 (PresActInd) my G3450 Father G3962 also G2532.
015:024 If G1508 I had G4160 not G1508 done G4160 (AorActInd) among G1722 them G0846 the works G2041 which G3739 none G3762 other man G0243 did G4160 (PerfActInd), they had G2192 not G3756 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) sin G0266: but G1161 now G3568 have they G3708 both G2532 seen G3708 (PerfActInd) and G2532 hated G3404 (PerfActInd) both G2532 me G1691 and G2532 my G3450 Father G3962.
015:025 But G0235 [this cometh to pass], that G2443 the word G3056 might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) that is written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 their G0846 law G3551, G3754 They hated G3404 (AorActInd) me G3165 without a cause G1432.
015:026 But G1161 when G3752 the Comforter G3875 is come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), whom G3739 I G1473 will send G3992 (FutActInd) unto you G5213 from G3844 the Father G3962, [even] the Spirit G4151 of truth G0225, which G3739 proceedeth G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) from G3844 the Father G3962, he G1565 shall testify G3140 (FutActInd) of G4012 me G1700:
015:027 And G1161 ye G5210 also G2532 shall bear witness G3140 (PresActInd), because G3754 ye have been G2075 (PresInd) with G3326 me G1700 from G0575 the beginning G0746.
016:001 ¶  These things G5023 have I spoken G2980 (PerfActInd) unto you G5213, that G3363 ye should G4624 not G3363 be offended G4624 (AorPasSubj).
016:002 They shall put G4160 (FutActInd) you G5209 out of the synagogues G0656: yea G0235, the time G5610 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), that G2443 whosoever G3956 killeth G0615 (AorActPtc) you G5209 will think G1380 (AorActSubj) that he doeth G4374 (PresActInf) God G2316 service G2999.
016:003 And G2532 these things G5023 will they do G4160 (FutActInd) unto you G5213, because G3754 they have G1097 not G3756 known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) the Father G3962, nor G3761 me G1691.
016:004 But G0235 these things G5023 have I told G2980 (PerfActInd) you G5213, that G2443 when G3752 the time G5610 shall come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), ye may remember G3421 (PresActSubj) that G3754 I G1473 told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) you G5213 of them G0846. And G1161 these things G5023 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 unto you G5213 at G1537 the beginning G0746, because G3754 I was G2252 (ImpfInd) with G3326 you G5216.
016:005 But G1161 now G3568 I go my way G5217 (PresActInd) to G4314 him that sent G3992 (AorActPtc) me G3165; and G2532 none G3762 of G1537 you G5216 asketh G2065 (PresActInd) me G3165, Whither G4226 goest thou G5217 (PresActInd)?
016:006 But G0235 because G3754 I have said G2980 (PerfActInd) these things G5023 unto you G5213, sorrow G3077 hath filled G4137 (PerfActInd) your G5216 heart G2588.
016:007 Nevertheless G0235 I G1473 tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213 the truth G0225; It is expedient G4851 (PresActInd) for you G5213 that G2443 I G1473 go away G0565 (Aor2ActSubj): for G1063 if G3362 I go G0565 not G3362 away G0565 (Aor2ActSubj), the Comforter G3875 will G2064 not G3756 come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) unto G4314 you G5209; but G1161 if G1437 I depart G4198 (AorPasDepSubj), I will send G3992 (FutActInd) him G0846 unto G4314 you G5209.
016:008 And G2532 when he is come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), he G1565 will reprove G1651 (FutActInd) the world G2889 of G4012 sin G0266, and G2532 of G4012 righteousness G1343, and G2532 of G4012 judgment G2920:
016:009 Of G4012 sin G0266, G3303 because G3754 they believe G4100 (PresActInd) not G3756 on G1519 me G1691;
016:010 Of G4012 G1161 righteousness G1343, because G3754 I go G5217 (PresActInd) to G4314 my G3450 Father G3962, and G2532 ye see G2334 (PresActInd) me G3165 no more G3765;
016:011 Of G4012 G1161 judgment G2920, because G3754 the prince G0758 of this G5127 world G2889 is judged G2919 (PerfPasInd).
016:012 I have G2192 (PresActInd) yet G2089 many things G4183 to say G3004 (PresActInf) unto you G5213, but G0235 ye cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) bear them G0941 (PresActInf) now G0737.
016:013 Howbeit G1161 when G3752 he G1565, the Spirit G4151 of truth G0225, is come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), he will guide G3594 (FutActInd) you G5209 into G1519 all G3956 truth G0225: for G1063 he shall G2980 not G3756 speak G2980 (FutActInd) of G0575 himself G1438; but G0235 whatsoever G3745 G0302 he shall hear G0191 (AorActSubj), [that] shall he speak G2980 (FutActInd): and G2532 he will shew G0312 (FutActInd) you G5213 things to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
016:014 He G1565 shall glorify G1392 (FutActInd) me G1691: for G3754 he shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) of G1537 mine G1699, and G2532 shall shew G0312 (FutActInd) [it] unto you G5213.
016:015 All things G3956 that G3745 the Father G3962 hath G2192 (PresActInd) are G2076 (PresInd) mine G1699: therefore G5124 G1223 said I G2036 (Aor2ActInd), that G3754 he shall take G2983 (FutMidDepInd) of G1537 mine G1699, and G2532 shall shew G0312 (FutActInd) [it] unto you G5213.
016:016 A little while G3397, and G2532 ye shall G2334 not G3756 see G2334 (PresActInd) me G3165: and G2532 again G3825, a little while G3397, and G2532 ye shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165, because G3754 I G1473 go G5217 (PresActInd) to G4314 the Father G3962.
016:017 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) [some] of G1537 his G0846 disciples G3101 among G4314 themselves G0240, What G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) this G5124 that G3739 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto us G2254, A little while G3397, and G2532 ye shall G2334 not G3756 see G2334 (PresActInd) me G3165: and G2532 again G3825, a little while G3397, and G2532 ye shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165: and G2532, Because G3754 I G1473 go G5217 (PresActInd) to G4314 the Father G3962?
016:018 They said G3004 (ImpfActInd) therefore G3767, What G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) this G5124 that G3739 he saith G3004 (PresActInd), A little while G3397? we cannot G3756 G1492 tell G1492 (PerfActInd) what G5101 he saith G2980 (PresActInd).
016:019 Now G3767 Jesus G2424 knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 they were desirous G2309 (ImpfActInd) to ask G2065 (PresActInf) him G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Do ye enquire G2212 (PresActInd) among G3326 yourselves G0240 of G4012 that G5127 G3754 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), A little while G3397, and G2532 ye shall G2334 not G3756 see G2334 (PresActInd) me G3165: and G2532 again G3825, a little while G3397, and G2532 ye shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165?
016:020 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 ye G5210 shall weep G2799 (FutActInd) and G2532 lament G2354 (FutActInd), but G1161 the world G2889 shall rejoice G5463 (Fut2PasDepInd): and G1161 ye G5210 shall be sorrowful G3076 (FutPasInd), but G0235 your G5216 sorrow G3077 shall be turned G1096 (FutMidDepInd) into G1519 joy G5479.
016:021 A woman G1135 when G3752 she is in travail G5088 (PresActSubj) hath G2192 (PresActInd) sorrow G3077, because G3754 her G0846 hour G5610 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd): but G1161 as soon as G3752 she is delivered G1080 (AorActSubj) of the child G3813, she remembereth G3421 (PresActInd) no more G3765 the anguish G2347, for G1223 joy G5479 that G3754 a man G0444 is born G1080 (AorPasInd) into G1519 the world G2889.
016:022 And G2532 ye G5210 G3303 now G3568 therefore G3767 have G2192 (PresActInd) sorrow G3077: but G1161 I will see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) you G5209 again G3825, and G2532 your G5216 heart G2588 shall rejoice G5463 (Fut2PasDepInd), and G2532 your G5216 joy G5479 no man G3762 taketh G0142 (PresActInd) from G0575 you G5216.
016:023 And G2532 in G1722 that G1565 day G2250 ye shall G3756 ask G2065 (FutActInd) me G1691 nothing G3762. Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 Whatsoever G3745 G0302 ye shall ask G0154 (AorActSubj) the Father G3962 in G1722 my G3450 name G3686, he will give G1325 (FutActInd) [it] you G5213.
016:024 Hitherto G2193 G0737 have ye asked G0154 (AorActInd) nothing G3756 G3762 in G1722 my G3450 name G3686: ask G0154 (PresActImpr), and G2532 ye shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd), that G2443 your G5216 joy G5479 may be G5600 (PresSubj) full G4137 (PerfPasPtc).
016:025 These things G5023 have I spoken G2980 (PerfActInd) unto you G5213 in G1722 proverbs G3942: but G0235 the time G5610 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), when G3753 I shall G2980 no more G3765 speak G2980 (FutActInd) unto you G5213 in G1722 proverbs G3942, but G0235 I shall shew G0312 (FutActInd) you G5213 plainly G3954 of G4012 the Father G3962.
016:026 At G1722 that G1565 day G2250 ye shall ask G0154 (FutMidInd) in G1722 my G3450 name G3686: and G2532 I say G3004 (PresActInd) not G3756 unto you G5213, that G3754 I G1473 will pray G2065 (FutActInd) the Father G3962 for G4012 you G5216:
016:027 For G1063 the Father G3962 himself G0846 loveth G5368 (PresActInd) you G5209, because G3754 ye G5210 have loved G5368 (PerfActInd) me G1691, and G2532 have believed G4100 (PerfActInd) that G3754 I G1473 came out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) from G3844 God G2316.
016:028 I came forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) from G3844 the Father G3962, and G2532 am come G2064 (Perf2ActInd) into G1519 the world G2889: again G3825, I leave G0863 (PresActInd) the world G2889, and G2532 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 the Father G3962.
016:029 His G0846 disciples G3101 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lo G2396, now G3568 speakest thou G2980 (PresActInd) plainly G3954, and G2532 speakest G3004 (PresActInd) no G3762 proverb G3942.
016:030 Now G3568 are we sure G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 thou knowest G1492 (PerfActInd) all things G3956, and G2532 needest G5532 not G3756 G2192 (PresActInd) that G2443 any man G5100 should ask G2065 (PresActSubj) thee G4571: by G1722 this G5129 we believe G4100 (PresActInd) that G3754 thou camest forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 God G2316.
016:031 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, Do ye G4100 now G0737 believe G4100 (PresActInd)?
016:032 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the hour G5610 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), yea G2532, is G2064 now G3568 come G2064 (Perf2ActInd), that G2443 ye shall be scattered G4650 (AorPasSubj), every man G1538 to G1519 his own G2398, and G2532 shall leave G0863 (Aor2ActSubj) me G1691 alone G3441: and yet G2532 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 alone G3441, because G3754 the Father G3962 is G2076 (PresInd) with G3326 me G1700.
016:033 These things G5023 I have spoken G2980 (PerfActInd) unto you G5213, that G2443 in G1722 me G1698 ye might have G2192 (PresActSubj) peace G1515. In G1722 the world G2889 ye shall have G2192 (PresActInd) G2192 (FutActInd) tribulation G2347: but G0235 be of good cheer G2293 (PresActImpr); I G1473 have overcome G3528 (PerfActInd) the world G2889.
017:001 ¶  These words G5023 spake G2980 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424, and G2532 lifted up G1869 (AorActInd) his G0846 eyes G3788 to G1519 heaven G3772, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Father G3962, the hour G5610 is come G2064 (Perf2ActInd); glorify G1392 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 Son G5207, that G2443 thy G4675 Son G5207 also G2532 may glorify G1392 (AorActSubj) thee G4571:
017:002 As G2531 thou hast given G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 power G1849 over all G3956 flesh G4561, that G2443 he should give G1325 (AorActSubj) eternal G0166 life G2222 to G3739 as many as G3956 G0846 thou hast given G1325 (PerfActInd) him G0846.
017:003 And G1161 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) life G2222 eternal G0166, that G2443 they might know G1097 (PresActSubj) thee G4571 the only G3441 true G0228 God G2316, and G2532 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, whom G3739 thou hast sent G0649 (AorActInd).
017:004 I G1473 have glorified G1392 (AorActInd) thee G4571 on G1909 the earth G1093: I have finished G5048 (AorActInd) the work G2041 which G3739 thou gavest G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427 to G2443 do G4160 (AorActSubj).
017:005 And G2532 now G3568, O Father G3962, glorify G1392 (AorActImpr) thou G4771 me G3165 with G3844 thine own self G4572 with the glory G1391 which G3739 I had G2192 (ImpfActInd) with G3844 thee G4671 before G4253 the world G2889 was G1511 (PresInf).
017:006 I have manifested G5319 (AorActInd) thy G4675 name G3686 unto the men G0444 which G3739 thou gavest G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427 out of G1537 the world G2889: thine G4674 they were G2258 (ImpfInd), and G2532 thou gavest G1325 (PerfActInd) them G0846 me G1698; and G2532 they have kept G5083 (PerfActInd) thy G4675 word G3056.
017:007 Now G3568 they have known G1097 (PerfActInd) that G3754 all things G3956 whatsoever G3745 thou hast given G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427 are G2076 (PresInd) of G3844 thee G4675.
017:008 For G3754 I have given G1325 (PerfActInd) unto them G0846 the words G4487 which G3739 thou gavest G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427; and G2532 they G0846 have received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) [them], and G2532 have known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) surely G0230 that G3754 I came out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) from G3844 thee G4675, and G2532 they have believed G4100 (AorActInd) that G3754 thou G4771 didst send G0649 (AorActInd) me G3165.
017:009 I G1473 pray G2065 (PresActInd) for G4012 them G0846: I pray G2065 (PresActInd) not G3756 for G4012 the world G2889, but G0235 for G4012 them which G3739 thou hast given G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427; for G3754 they are G1526 (PresInd) thine G4674.
017:010 And G2532 all G3956 mine G1699 are G2076 (PresInd) thine G4674, and G2532 thine G4674 are mine G1699; and G2532 I am glorified G1392 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 them G0846.
017:011 And G2532 now G3765 I am G1510 (PresInd) no more G3765 in G1722 the world G2889, but G2532 these G3778 are G1526 (PresInd) in G1722 the world G2889, and G2532 I G1473 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 thee G4571. Holy G0040 Father G3962, keep G5083 (AorActImpr) through G1722 thine own G4675 name G3686 those G0846 whom G3739 thou hast given G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427, that G2443 they may be G5600 (PresSubj) one G1520, as G2531 we G2249 [are].
017:012 While G3753 I was G2252 (ImpfInd) with G3326 them G0846 in G1722 the world G2889, I G1473 kept G5083 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 in G1722 thy G4675 name G3686: those that G3739 thou gavest G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427 I have kept G5442 (AorActInd), and G2532 none G3762 of G1537 them G0846 is lost G0622 (Aor2MidInd), but G1508 the son G5207 of perdition G0684; that G2443 the scripture G1124 might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj).
017:013 And G1161 now G3568 come I G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 thee G4571; and G2532 these things G5023 I speak G2980 (PresActInd) in G1722 the world G2889, that G2443 they might have G2192 (PresActSubj) my G1699 joy G5479 fulfilled G4137 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 themselves G0846.
017:014 I G1473 have given G1325 (PerfActInd) them G0846 thy G4675 word G3056; and G2532 the world G2889 hath hated G3404 (AorActInd) them G0846, because G3754 they are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 the world G2889, even as G2531 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 the world G2889.
017:015 I pray G2065 (PresActInd) not G3756 that G2443 thou shouldest take G0142 (AorActSubj) them G0846 out of G1537 the world G2889, but G0235 that G2443 thou shouldest keep G5083 (AorActSubj) them G0846 from G1537 the evil G4190.
017:016 They are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 the world G2889, even as G2531 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 the world G2889.
017:017 Sanctify G0037 (AorActImpr) them G0846 through G1722 thy G4675 truth G0225: thy G4674 word G3056 is G2076 (PresInd) truth G0225.
017:018 As G2531 thou hast sent G0649 (AorActInd) me G1691 into G1519 the world G2889, even so G2504 have G0649 I also G2504 sent G0649 (AorActInd) them G0846 into G1519 the world G2889.
017:019 And G2532 for G5228 their G0846 sakes G5228 I G1473 sanctify G0037 (PresActInd) myself G1683, that G2443 they G0846 also G2532 might G5600 (PresSubj) be sanctified G0037 (PerfPasPtc) through G1722 the truth G0225.
017:020 Neither G1161 G3756 pray I G2065 (PresActInd) for G4012 these G5130 alone G3440, but G0235 for G4012 them also G2532 which shall believe G4100 (FutActPtc) on G1519 me G1691 through G1223 their G0846 word G3056;
017:021 That G2443 they all G3956 may be G5600 (PresSubj) one G1520; as G2531 thou G4771, Father G3962, [art] in G1722 me G1698, and I G2504 in G1722 thee G4671, that G2443 they G0846 also G2532 may be G5600 (PresSubj) one G1520 in G1722 us G2254: that G2443 the world G2889 may believe G4100 (AorActSubj) that G3754 thou G4771 hast sent G0649 (AorActInd) me G3165.
017:022 And G2532 the glory G1391 which G3739 thou gavest G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427 I G1473 have given G1325 (PerfActInd) them G0846; that G2443 they may be G5600 (PresSubj) one G1520, even as G2531 we G2249 are G2070 (PresInd) one G1520:
017:023 I G1473 in G1722 them G0846, and G2532 thou G4771 in G1722 me G1698, that G2443 they may be G5600 (PresSubj) made perfect G5048 (PerfPasPtc) in G1519 one G1520; and G2532 that G2443 the world G2889 may know G1097 (PresActSubj) that G3754 thou G4771 hast sent G0649 (AorActInd) me G3165, and G2532 hast loved G0025 (AorActInd) them G0846, as G2531 thou hast loved G0025 (AorActInd) me G1691.
017:024 Father G3962, I will G2309 (PresActInd) that G2443 they also G2548, whom G3739 thou hast given G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427, be G5600 (PresSubj) with G3326 me G1700 where G3699 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd); that G2443 they may behold G2334 (PresActSubj) my G1699 glory G1391, which G3739 thou hast given G1325 (AorActInd) me G3427: for G3754 thou lovedst G0025 (AorActInd) me G3165 before G4253 the foundation G2602 of the world G2889.
017:025 G2532 O righteous G1342 Father G3962, the world G2889 hath G1097 not G3756 known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571: but G1161 I G1473 have known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571, and G2532 these G3778 have known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 thou G4771 hast sent G0649 (AorActInd) me G3165.
017:026 And G2532 I have declared G1107 (AorActInd) unto them G0846 thy G4675 name G3686, and G2532 will declare G1107 (FutActInd) [it]: that G2443 the love G0026 wherewith G3739 thou hast loved G0025 (AorActInd) me G3165 may be G5600 (PresSubj) in G1722 them G0846, and I G2504 in G1722 them G0846.
018:001 ¶  When Jesus G2424 had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) these words G5023, he went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) with G4862 his G0846 disciples G3101 over G4008 the brook G5493 Cedron G2748, where G3699 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a garden G2779, into G1519 the which G3739 he G0846 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101.
018:002 And G1161 Judas G2455 also G2532, which G3588 betrayed G3860 (PresActPtc) him G0846, knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) the place G5117: for G3754 Jesus G2424 ofttimes G4178 resorted G4863 (AorPasInd) thither G1563 with G3326 his G0846 disciples G3101.
018:003 Judas G2455 then G3767, having received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) a band G4686 [of men] and G2532 officers G5257 from G1537 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) thither G1563 with G3326 lanterns G5322 and G2532 torches G2985 and G2532 weapons G3696.
018:004 Jesus G2424 therefore G3767, knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) all things G3956 that should come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 him G0846, went forth G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Whom G5101 seek ye G2212 (PresActInd)?
018:005 They answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480. Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) [he]. And G1161 Judas G2455 also G2532, which G3588 betrayed G3860 (PresActPtc) him G0846, stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) with G3326 them G0846.
018:006 As soon G5613 then G3767 as he had said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) [he], they went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) backward G1519 G3694, and G2532 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) to the ground G5476.
018:007 Then G3767 asked he G1905 (AorActInd) them G0846 again G3825, Whom G5101 seek ye G2212 (PresActInd)? And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480.
018:008 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), I have told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) you G5213 that G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) [he]: if G1487 therefore G3767 ye seek G2212 (PresActInd) me G1691, let G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) these G5128 go their way G5217 (PresActInf):
018:009 That G2443 the saying G3056 might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj), which G3739 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd), G3754 Of G1537 them G0846 which G3739 thou gavest G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427 have I G3756 lost G0622 (AorActInd) none G3762.
018:010 Then G3767 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 having G2192 (PresActPtc) a sword G3162 drew G1670 (AorActInd) it G0846, and G2532 smote G3817 (AorActInd) the high priest’s G0749 servant G1401, and G2532 cut off G0609 (AorActInd) his G0846 right G1188 ear G5621. G1161 The servant’s G1401 name G3686 was G2258 (ImpfInd) Malchus G3124.
018:011 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto Peter G4074, Put up G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) thy G4675 sword G3162 into G1519 the sheath G2336: the cup G4221 which G3739 my Father G3962 hath given G1325 (PerfActInd) me G3427, shall I G4095 not G3378 drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj) it G0846?
018:012 Then G3767 the band G4686 and G2532 the captain G5506 and G2532 officers G5257 of the Jews G2453 took G4815 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424, and G2532 bound G1210 (AorActInd) him G0846,
018:013 And G2532 led G0520 him G0846 away G0520 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 Annas G0452 first G4412; for G1063 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) father in law G3995 to Caiaphas G2533, which G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the high priest G0749 that same G1565 year G1763.
018:014 Now G1161 Caiaphas G2533 was he G2258 (ImpfInd), which G3588 gave counsel G4823 (AorActPtc) to the Jews G2453, that G3754 it was expedient G4851 (PresActInd) that one G1520 man G0444 should die G0622 (Aor2MidInf) for G5228 the people G2992.
018:015 And G1161 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) Jesus G2424, and G2532 [so did] another G0243 disciple G3101: G1161 that G1565 disciple G3101 was G2258 (ImpfInd) known G1110 unto the high priest G0749, and G2532 went in with G4897 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 into G1519 the palace G0833 of the high priest G0749.
018:016 But G1161 Peter G4074 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) at G4314 the door G2374 without G1854. Then G3767 went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) that other G0243 disciple G3101, which G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) known G1110 unto the high priest G0749, and G2532 spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her that kept the door G2377, and G2532 brought in G1521 (Aor2ActInd) Peter G4074.
018:017 Then G3767 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the damsel G3814 that kept the door G2377 unto Peter G4074, Art G1488 (PresInd) not G3361 thou G4771 also G2532 [one] of G1537 this G5127 man’s G0444 disciples G3101? He G1565 saith G3004 (PresActInd), I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756.
018:018 And G1161 the servants G1401 and G2532 officers G5257 stood there G2476 (PlupfActInd), who had made G4160 (PerfActPtc) a fire of coals G0439; for G3754 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) cold G5592: and G2532 they warmed themselves G2328 (ImpfMidPasDepInd): and G1161 Peter G4074 stood G2258 (ImpfInd) G2476 (PerfActPtc) with G3326 them G0846, and G2532 warmed himself G2328 (PresMidPtc).
018:019 The high priest G0749 then G3767 asked G2065 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 of G4012 his G0846 disciples G3101, and G2532 of G4012 his G0846 doctrine G1322.
018:020 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, I G1473 spake G2980 (AorActInd) openly G3954 to the world G2889; I G1473 ever G3842 taught G1321 (AorActInd) in G1722 the synagogue G4864, and G2532 in G1722 the temple G2411, whither G3699 the Jews G2453 always G3842 resort G4905 (PresMidPasDepInd); and G2532 in G1722 secret G2927 have I said G2980 (AorActInd) nothing G3762.
018:021 Why G5101 askest thou G1905 (PresActInd) me G3165? ask G1905 (AorActImpr) them which heard me G0191 (Perf2ActPtc), what G5101 I have said G2980 (AorActInd) unto them G0846: behold G2396, they G3778 know G1492 (PerfActInd) what G3739 I G1473 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd).
018:022 And G1161 when he G0846 had G2036 thus G5023 spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), one G1520 of the officers G5257 which stood by G3936 (PerfActPtc) struck G1325 G4475 Jesus G2424 with the palm of his hand G1325 (AorActInd) G4475, saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), Answerest thou G0611 (PresMidPasDepInd) the high priest G0749 so G3779?
018:023 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, If G1487 I have spoken G2980 (AorActInd) evil G2560, bear witness G3140 (AorActImpr) of G4012 the evil G2556: but G1161 if G1487 well G2573, why G5101 smitest G1194 (PresActInd) thou me G3165?
018:024 Now Annas G0452 had sent G0649 (AorActInd) him G0846 bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) unto G4314 Caiaphas G2533 the high priest G0749.
018:025 And G1161 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 stood G2258 (ImpfInd) G2476 (PerfActPtc) and G2532 warmed himself G2328 (PresMidPtc). They said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) therefore G3767 unto him G0846, Art G1488 (PresInd) not G3361 thou G4771 also G2532 [one] of G1537 his G0846 disciples G3101? He G1565 denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) [it], and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756.
018:026 One G1520 of G1537 the servants G1401 of the high priest G0749, being G5607 (PresPtc) [his] kinsman G4773 whose G3739 ear G5621 Peter G4074 cut off G0609 (AorActInd), saith G3004 (PresActInd), Did G1492 not G3756 I G1473 see G1492 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571 in G1722 the garden G2779 with G3326 him G0846?
018:027 Peter G4074 then G3767 denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) again G3825: and G2532 immediately G2112 the cock G0220 crew G5455 (AorActInd).
018:028 Then G3767 led they G0071 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 from G0575 Caiaphas G2533 unto G1519 the hall of judgment G4232: and G1161 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) early G4405; and G2532 they themselves G0846 went G1525 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 into G1519 the judgment hall G4232, lest G3363 they should be defiled G3392 (AorPasSubj); but G0235 that G2443 they might eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) the passover G3957.
018:029 Pilate G4091 then G3767 went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 accusation G2724 bring ye G5342 (PresActInd) against G2596 this G5127 man G0444?
018:030 They answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, If G1508 he G3778 were G2258 (ImpfInd) not G1508 a malefactor G2555, we would G0302 not G3756 have delivered G3860 him G0846 up G3860 (AorActInd) unto thee G4671.
018:031 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Pilate G4091 unto them G0846, Take G2983 (Aor2ActImpr) ye G5210 him G0846, and G2532 judge G2919 (AorActImpr) him G0846 according G2596 to your G5216 law G3551. The Jews G2453 therefore G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, It is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) for us G2254 to put G0615 any man G3762 to death G0615 (AorActInf):
018:032 That G2443 the saying G3056 of Jesus G2424 might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj), which G3739 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd), signifying G4591 (PresActPtc) what G4169 death G2288 he should G3195 (ImpfActInd) die G0599 (PresActInf).
018:033 Then G3767 Pilate G4091 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the judgment hall G4232 again G3825, and G2532 called G5455 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 the King G0935 of the Jews G2453?
018:034 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, Sayest G3004 (PresActInd) thou G4771 this thing G5124 of G0575 thyself G1438, or G2228 did others G0243 tell it G2036 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4671 of G4012 me G1700?
018:035 Pilate G4091 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), G3385 Am G1510 (PresInd) I G1473 a Jew G2453? Thine own G4674 nation G1484 and G2532 the chief priests G0749 have delivered G3860 (AorActInd) thee G4571 unto me G1698: what G5101 hast thou done G4160 (AorActInd)?
018:036 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), My G1699 kingdom G0932 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 of G1537 this G5127 world G2889: if G1487 my G1699 kingdom G0932 were G2258 (ImpfInd) of G1537 this G5127 world G2889, then would G0302 my G1699 servants G5257 fight G0075 (ImpfMidPasDepInd), that G3363 I should G3860 not G3363 be delivered G3860 (AorPasSubj) to the Jews G2453: but G1161 now G3568 is G2076 (PresInd) my G1699 kingdom G0932 not G3756 from hence G1782.
018:037 Pilate G4091 therefore G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 a king G0935 then G3766? Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Thou G4771 sayest G3004 (PresActInd) that G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) a king G0935. To G1519 this G5124 end was G1080 I G1473 born G1080 (PerfPasInd), and G2532 for G1519 this G5124 cause came I G2064 (Perf2ActInd) into G1519 the world G2889, that G2443 I should bear witness G3140 (AorActSubj) unto the truth G0225. Every one G3956 that is G5607 (PresPtc) of G1537 the truth G0225 heareth G0191 (PresActInd) my G3450 voice G5456.
018:038 Pilate G4091 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, What G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) truth G0225? And G2532 when he had said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) this G5124, he went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825 unto G4314 the Jews G2453, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, I G1473 find G2147 (PresActInd) in G1722 him G0846 no G3762 fault G0156 [at all].
018:039 But G1161 ye G5213 have G2076 (PresInd) a custom G4914, that G2443 I should release G0630 (AorActSubj) unto you G5213 one G1520 at G1722 the passover G3957: will ye G1014 (PresMidPasDepInd) therefore G3767 that I release G0630 (AorActSubj) unto you G5213 the King G0935 of the Jews G2453?
018:040 Then G3767 cried they G2905 (AorActInd) all G3956 again G3825, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Not G3361 this man G5126, but G0235 Barabbas G0912. Now G1161 Barabbas G0912 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a robber G3027.
019:001 ¶  Then G5119 Pilate G4091 therefore G3767 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424, and G2532 scourged G3146 (AorActInd) [him].
019:002 And G2532 the soldiers G4757 platted G4120 (AorActPtc) a crown G4735 of G1537 thorns G0173, and put [it] on G2007 (AorActInd) his G0846 head G2776, and G2532 they put on G4016 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 a purple G4210 robe G2440,
019:003 And G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Hail G5463 (PresActImpr), King G0935 of the Jews G2453! and G2532 they smote G1325 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 with their hands G4475.
019:004 Pilate G4091 therefore G3767 went G1831 (Aor2ActInd) forth G1854 again G3825, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Behold G2396, I bring G0071 (PresActInd) him G0846 forth G1854 to you G5213, that G2443 ye may know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) that G3754 I find G2147 (PresActInd) no G3762 fault G0156 in G1722 him G0846.
019:005 Then G3767 came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 forth G1854, wearing G5409 (PresActPtc) the crown G4735 of thorns G0174, and G2532 the purple G4210 robe G2440. And G2532 [Pilate] saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Behold G2396 the man G0444!
019:006 When G3753 the chief priests G0749 therefore G3767 and G2532 officers G5257 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, they cried out G2905 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Crucify G4717 (AorActImpr) [him], crucify G4717 (AorActImpr) [him]. Pilate G4091 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Take G2983 (Aor2ActImpr) ye G5210 him G0846, and G2532 crucify G4717 (AorActImpr) [him]: for G1063 I G1473 find G2147 (PresActInd) no G3756 fault G0156 in G1722 him G0846.
019:007 The Jews G2453 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, We G2249 have G2192 (PresActInd) a law G3551, and G2532 by G2596 our G2257 law G3551 he ought G3784 (PresActInd) to die G0599 (Aor2ActInf), because G3754 he made G4160 (AorActInd) himself G1438 the Son G5207 of God G2316.
019:008 When G3753 Pilate G4091 therefore G3767 heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G5126 saying G3056, he was G5399 the more G3123 afraid G5399 (AorPasDepInd);
019:009 And G2532 went G1525 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825 into G1519 the judgment hall G4232, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto Jesus G2424, Whence G4159 art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771? But G1161 Jesus G2424 gave G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 no G3756 answer G0612.
019:010 Then G3767 saith G3004 (PresActInd) Pilate G4091 unto him G0846, Speakest thou G2980 (PresActInd) not G3756 unto me G1698? knowest thou G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 I have G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 to crucify G4717 (AorActInf) thee G4571, and G2532 have G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 to release G0630 (AorActInf) thee G4571?
019:011 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Thou couldest have G2192 (ImpfActInd) no G3756 power G1849 [at all] against G3762 G2596 me G1700, except G1508 it were G2258 (ImpfInd) given G1325 (PerfPasPtc) thee G4671 from above G0509: therefore G5124 G1223 he that delivered G3860 (PresActPtc) me G3165 unto thee G4671 hath G2192 (PresActInd) the greater G3187 sin G0266.
019:012 And from G1537 thenceforth G5127 Pilate G4091 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to release G0630 (AorActInf) him G0846: but G1161 the Jews G2453 cried out G2896 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), If G1437 thou let G0630 this man G5126 go G0630 (AorActSubj), thou art G1488 (PresInd) not G3756 Caesar’s G2541 friend G5384: whosoever G3956 maketh G4160 (PresActPtc) himself G0846 a king G0935 speaketh against G0483 (PresActInd) Caesar G2541.
019:013 When Pilate G4091 therefore G3767 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G5126 saying G3056, he brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 forth G1854, and G2532 sat down G2523 (AorActInd) in G1909 the judgment seat G0968 in G1519 a place G5117 that is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) the Pavement G3038, but G1161 in the Hebrew G1447, Gabbatha G1042.
019:014 And G1161 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) the preparation G3904 of the passover G3957, and G1161 about G5616 the sixth G1623 hour G5610: and G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the Jews G2453, Behold G2396 your G5216 King G0935!
019:015 But G1161 they cried out G2905 (AorActInd), Away with G0142 (AorActImpr) [him], away with G0142 (AorActImpr) [him], crucify G4717 (AorActImpr) him G0846. Pilate G4091 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Shall I crucify G4717 (FutActInd) your G5216 King G0935? The chief priests G0749 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), We have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 king G0935 but G1508 Caesar G2541.
019:016 Then G5119 delivered he G3860 (AorActInd) him G0846 therefore G3767 unto them G0846 to G2443 be crucified G4717 (AorPasSubj). And G1161 they took G3880 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424, and G2532 led [him] away G0520 (Aor2ActInd).
019:017 And G2532 he bearing G0941 (PresActPtc) his G0846 cross G4716 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a place G5117 called G3004 (PresPasPtc) [the place] of a skull G2898, which G3739 is called G3004 (PresPasInd) in the Hebrew G1447 Golgotha G1115:
019:018 Where G3699 they crucified G4717 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 two G1417 other G0243 with G3326 him G0846, on either side one G2532 G1782 G1782, and G1161 Jesus G2424 in the midst G3319.
019:019 And G1161 G2532 Pilate G4091 wrote G1125 (AorActInd) a title G5102, and G2532 put G5087 (AorActInd) [it] on G1909 the cross G4716. And G1161 the writing G1125 (PerfPasPtc) was G2258 (ImpfInd), JESUS G2424 OF NAZARETH G3480 THE KING G0935 OF THE JEWS G2453.
019:020 This G5126 title G5102 then G3767 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd) many G4183 of the Jews G2453: for G3754 the place G5117 where G3699 Jesus G2424 was crucified G4717 (AorPasInd) was G2258 (ImpfInd) nigh G1451 to the city G4172: and G2532 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in Hebrew G1447, [and] Greek G1676, [and] Latin G4515.
019:021 Then G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) the chief priests G0749 of the Jews G2453 to Pilate G4091, Write G1125 (PresActImpr) not G3361, The King G0935 of the Jews G2453; but G0235 that G3754 he G1565 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I am G1510 (PresInd) King G0935 of the Jews G2453.
019:022 Pilate G4091 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), What G3739 I have written G1125 (PerfActInd) I have written G1125 (PerfActInd).
019:023 Then G3767 the soldiers G4757, when G3753 they had crucified G4717 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424, took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 garments G2440, and G2532 made G4160 (AorActInd) four G5064 parts G3313, to every G1538 soldier G4757 a part G3313; and also G2532 [his] coat G5509: now G1161 the coat G5509 was G2258 (ImpfInd) without seam G0729, woven G5307 from G1537 the top G0509 throughout G1223 G3650.
019:024 They said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) therefore G3767 among G4314 themselves G0240, Let us G4977 not G3361 rend G4977 (AorActSubj) it G0846, but G0235 cast lots G2975 (Aor2ActSubj) for G4012 it G0846, whose G5101 it shall be G2071 (FutInd): that G2443 the scripture G1124 might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj), which G3588 saith G3004 (PresActPtc), They parted G1266 (AorMidInd) my G3450 raiment G2440 among them G1438, and G2532 for G1909 my G3450 vesture G2441 they did cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) lots G2819. These things G5023 G3303 therefore G3767 the soldiers G4757 did G4160 (AorActInd).
019:025 Now G1161 there stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) by G3844 the cross G4716 of Jesus G2424 his G0846 mother G3384, and G2532 his G0846 mother’s G3384 sister G0079, Mary G3137 the [wife] G3588 of Cleophas G2832, and G2532 Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094.
019:026 When Jesus G2424 therefore G3767 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) his mother G3384, and G2532 the disciple G3101 standing by G3936 (PerfActPtc), whom G3739 he loved G0025 (ImpfActInd), he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto his G0846 mother G3384, Woman G1135, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) thy G4675 son G5207!
019:027 Then G1534 saith he G3004 (PresActInd) to the disciple G3101, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) thy G4675 mother G3384! And G2532 from G0575 that G1565 hour G5610 that disciple G3101 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846 unto G1519 his own G2398 [home].
019:028 After G3326 this G5124, Jesus G2424 knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 all things G3956 were G5055 now G2235 accomplished G5055 (PerfPasInd), that G2443 the scripture G1124 might be fulfilled G5048 (AorPasSubj), saith G3004 (PresActInd), I thirst G1372 (PresActInd).
019:029 Now G3767 there was set G2749 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) a vessel G4632 full G3324 of vinegar G3690: and G1161 they filled G4130 (AorActPtc) a spunge G4699 with vinegar G3690, and G2532 put [it] upon G4060 (Aor2ActPtc) hyssop G5301, and put G4374 (AorActInd) [it] to his G0846 mouth G4750.
019:030 When G3753 Jesus G2424 therefore G3767 had received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the vinegar G3690, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), It is finished G5055 (PerfPasInd): and G2532 he bowed G2827 (AorActPtc) his head G2776, and gave up G3860 (AorActInd) the ghost G4151.
019:031 The Jews G2453 therefore G3767, because G1893 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) G2258 (ImpfInd) the preparation G3904, that G3363 the bodies G4983 should G3306 not G3363 remain G3306 (AorActSubj) upon G1909 the cross G4716 on G1722 the sabbath day G4521, (for G1063 that G1565 sabbath day G4521 was G2258 (ImpfInd) an high G3173 day G2250,) besought G2065 (AorActInd) Pilate G4091 that G2443 their G0846 legs G4628 might be broken G2608 (Aor2PasSubj), and G2532 [that] they might be taken away G0142 (AorPasSubj).
019:032 Then G3767 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) the soldiers G4757, and G2532 brake G2608 (AorActInd) the legs G4628 of the G3303 first G4413, and G2532 of the other G0243 which G3588 was crucified with G4957 (AorPasPtc) him G0846.
019:033 But G1161 when G5613 they came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1909 Jesus G2424, and saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) that he G0846 was dead G2348 (PerfActPtc) already G2235, they brake G2608 (AorActInd) not G3756 his G0846 legs G4628:
019:034 But G0235 one G1520 of the soldiers G4757 with a spear G3057 pierced G3572 (AorActInd) his G0846 side G4125, and G2532 forthwith G2117 came there out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) blood G0129 and G2532 water G5204.
019:035 And G2532 he that saw G3708 (PerfActPtc) [it] bare record G3140 (PerfActInd), and G2532 his G0846 record G3141 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0228: and he G2548 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) true G0227, that G2443 ye G5210 might believe G4100 (AorActSubj).
019:036 For G1063 these things G5023 were done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that G2443 the scripture G1124 should be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj), A bone G3747 of him G0846 shall G4937 not G3756 be broken G4937 (Fut2PasInd).
019:037 And G2532 again G3825 another G2087 scripture G1124 saith G3004 (PresActInd), They shall look G3700 (FutMidDepInd) on G1519 him whom G3739 they pierced G1574 (AorActInd).
019:038 And G1161 after G3326 this G5023 Joseph G2501 of G0575 Arimathaea G0707, being G5607 (PresPtc) a disciple G3101 of Jesus G2424, but G1161 secretly G2928 (PerfPasPtc) for G1223 fear G5401 of the Jews G2453, besought G2065 (AorActInd) Pilate G4091 that G2443 he might take away G0142 (AorActSubj) the body G4983 of Jesus G2424: and G2532 Pilate G4091 gave [him] leave G2010 (AorActInd). He came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) therefore G3767, and G2532 took G0142 (AorActInd) the body G4983 of Jesus G2424.
019:039 And G1161 there came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) also G2532 Nicodemus G3530, which G3588 at the first G4412 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G4314 Jesus G2424 by night G3571, and brought G5342 (PresActPtc) a mixture G3395 of myrrh G4666 and G2532 aloes G0250, about G5616 an hundred G1540 pound G3046 [weight].
019:040 Then G3767 took they G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the body G4983 of Jesus G2424, and G2532 wound G1210 (AorActInd) it G0846 in linen clothes G3608 with G3326 the spices G0759, as G2531 the manner G1485 of the Jews G2453 is G2076 (PresInd) to bury G1779 (PresActInf).
019:041 Now G1161 in G1722 the place G5117 where G3699 he was crucified G4717 (AorPasInd) there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a garden G2779; and G2532 in G1722 the garden G2779 a new G2537 sepulchre G3419, wherein G1722 G3739 was G5087 never G3764 man G3762 yet G3764 laid G5087 (AorPasInd).
019:042 There G1563 laid they G5087 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 therefore G3767 because G1223 of the Jews G2453 ’ preparation G3904 [day]; for G3754 the sepulchre G3419 was G2258 (ImpfInd) nigh at hand G1451.
020:001 ¶  G1161 The first G3391 [day] of the week G4521 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094 early G4404, when it was G5607 (PresPtc) yet G2089 dark G4653, unto G1519 the sepulchre G3419, and G2532 seeth G0991 (PresActInd) the stone G3037 taken away G0142 (PerfPasPtc) from G1537 the sepulchre G3419.
020:002 Then G3767 she runneth G5143 (PresActInd), and G2532 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 Simon G4613 Peter G4074, and G2532 to G4314 the other G0243 disciple G3101, whom G3739 Jesus G2424 loved G5368 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, They have taken away G0142 (AorActInd) the Lord G2962 out of G1537 the sepulchre G3419, and G2532 we know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 where G4226 they have laid G5087 (AorActInd) him G0846.
020:003 Peter G4074 therefore G3767 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 that other G0243 disciple G3101, and G2532 came G2064 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to G1519 the sepulchre G3419.
020:004 So G1161 they ran G5143 (ImpfActInd) both G1417 together G3674: and G2532 the other G0243 disciple G3101 did outrun G4390 (Aor2ActInd) G5032 Peter G4074, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) first G4413 to G1519 the sepulchre G3419.
020:005 And G2532 he stooping down G3879 (AorActPtc), [and looking in], saw G0991 (PresActInd) the linen clothes G3608 lying G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc); yet G3305 went he G1525 not G3756 in G1525 (Aor2ActInd).
020:006 Then G3767 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) Simon G4613 Peter G4074 following G0190 (PresActPtc) him G0846, and G2532 went G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the sepulchre G3419, and G2532 seeth G2334 (PresActInd) the linen clothes G3608 lie G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc),
020:007 And G2532 the napkin G4676, that G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) about G1909 his G0846 head G2776, not G3756 lying G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with G3326 the linen clothes G3608, but G0235 wrapped together G1794 (PerfPasPtc) in G1519 a place G5117 by itself G1520 G5565.
020:008 Then G5119 G3767 went in G1525 (Aor2ActInd) also G2532 that other G0243 disciple G3101, which G3588 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) first G4413 to G1519 the sepulchre G3419, and G2532 he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 believed G4100 (AorActInd).
020:009 For G1063 as yet G3764 they knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3764 the scripture G1124, that G3754 he G0846 must G1163 (PresInd) rise again G0450 (Aor2ActInf) from G1537 the dead G3498.
020:010 Then G3767 the disciples G3101 went away G0565 (Aor2ActInd) again G3825 unto G4314 their own home G1438.
020:011 But G1161 Mary G3137 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) without G1854 at G4314 the sepulchre G3419 weeping G2799 (PresActPtc): and G3767 as G5613 she wept G2799 (ImpfActInd), she stooped down G3879 (AorActInd), [and looked] into G1519 the sepulchre G3419,
020:012 And G2532 seeth G2334 (PresActInd) two G1417 angels G0032 in G1722 white G3022 sitting G2516 (PresMidPasDepPtc), the one G1520 at G4314 the head G2776, and G2532 the other G1520 at G4314 the feet G4228, where G3699 the body G4983 of Jesus G2424 had lain G2749 (ImpfMidPasDepInd).
020:013 And G2532 they G1565 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Woman G1135, why G5101 weepest thou G2799 (PresActInd)? She saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Because G3754 they have taken away G0142 (AorActInd) my G3450 Lord G2962, and G2532 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 where G4226 they have laid G5087 (AorActInd) him G0846.
020:014 And G2532 when she had G2036 thus G5023 said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), she turned G4762 (Aor2PasDepSubj) herself G1519 back G3694, and G2532 saw G2334 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc), and G2532 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 it was G2076 (PresInd) Jesus G2424.
020:015 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Woman G1135, why G5101 weepest thou G2799 (PresActInd)? whom G5101 seekest thou G2212 (PresActInd)? She G1565, supposing G1380 (PresActPtc) G3754 him to be G2076 (PresInd) the gardener G2780, saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Sir G2962, if G1487 thou G4771 have borne G0941 him G0846 hence G0941 (AorActInd), tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427 where G4226 thou hast laid G5087 (AorActInd) him G0846, and I G2504 will take G0142 him G0846 away G0142 (FutActInd).
020:016 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Mary G3137. She G1565 turned G4762 (Aor2PasPtc) herself, and saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Rabboni G4462; which G3739 is to say G3004 (PresPasInd), Master G1320.
020:017 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto her G0846, Touch G0680 (PresMidImpr) me G3450 not G3361; for G1063 I am G0305 not yet G3768 ascended G0305 (PerfActInd) to G4314 my G3450 Father G3962: but G1161 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) to G4314 my G3450 brethren G0080, and G2532 say G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) unto them G0846, I ascend G0305 (PresActInd) unto G4314 my G3450 Father G3962, and G2532 your G5216 Father G3962; and G2532 [to] my G3450 God G2316, and G2532 your G5216 God G2316.
020:018 Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094 came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) and told G0518 (PresActPtc) the disciples G3101 that G3754 she had seen G3708 (PerfActInd) the Lord G2962, and G2532 [that] he had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActInd) these things G5023 unto her G0846.
020:019 Then G3767 the same G1565 day G2250 at evening G3798, being G5607 (PresPtc) the first G3391 [day] of the week G4521, when G2532 the doors G2374 were shut G2808 (PerfPasPtc) where G3699 the disciples G3101 were G2258 (ImpfInd) assembled G4863 (PerfPasPtc) for G1223 fear G5401 of the Jews G2453, came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 and G2532 stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) in G1519 the midst G3319, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Peace G1515 [be] unto you G5213.
020:020 And G2532 when he had G2036 so G5124 said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), he shewed G1166 (AorActInd) unto them G0846 [his] hands G5495 and G2532 his G0846 side G4125. Then G3767 were G5463 the disciples G3101 glad G5463 (Aor2PasDepInd), when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the Lord G2962.
020:021 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 to them G0846 again G3825, Peace G1515 [be] unto you G5213: as G2531 [my] Father G3962 hath sent G0649 (PerfActInd) me G3165, even so G2504 send G3992 (PresActInd) I G2504 you G5209.
020:022 And G2532 when he had said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) this G5124, he breathed on G1720 (AorActInd) [them], and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Receive ye G2983 (Aor2ActImpr) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151:
020:023 Whose G5100 soever G0302 sins G0266 ye remit G0863 (Aor2ActSubj), they are remitted G0863 (PresPasInd) unto them G0846; [and] whose G5100 soever G0302 [sins] ye retain G2902 (PresActSubj), they are retained G2902 (PerfPasInd).
020:024 But G1161 Thomas G2381, one G1520 of G1537 the twelve G1427, called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Didymus G1324, was G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3756 with G3326 them G0846 when G3753 Jesus G2424 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd).
020:025 The other G0243 disciples G3101 therefore G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846, We have seen G3708 (PerfActInd) the Lord G2962. But G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Except G3362 I shall see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 his G0846 hands G5495 the print G5179 of the nails G2247, and G2532 put G0906 (Aor2ActSubj) my G3450 finger G1147 into G1519 the print G5179 of the nails G2247, and G2532 thrust G0906 (Aor2ActSubj) my G3450 hand G5495 into G1519 his G0846 side G4125, I will G4100 not G3364 believe G4100 (FutActInd).
020:026 And G2532 after G3326 eight G3638 days G2250 again G3825 his G0846 disciples G3101 were G2258 (ImpfInd) within G2080, and G2532 Thomas G2381 with G3326 them G0846: [then] came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) Jesus G2424, the doors G2374 being shut G2808 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) in G1519 the midst G3319, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Peace G1515 [be] unto you G5213.
020:027 Then G1534 saith he G3004 (PresActInd) to Thomas G2381, Reach G5342 (PresActImpr) hither G5602 thy G4675 finger G1147, and G2532 behold G1492 (AorActImpr) my G3450 hands G5495; and G2532 reach hither G5342 (PresActImpr) thy G4675 hand G5495, and G2532 thrust G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) [it] into G1519 my G3450 side G4125: and G2532 be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361 faithless G0571, but G0235 believing G4103.
020:028 And G2532 Thomas G2381 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, My G3450 Lord G2962 and G2532 my G3450 God G2316.
020:029 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Thomas G2381, because G3754 thou hast seen G3708 (PerfActInd) me G3165, thou hast believed G4100 (PerfActInd): blessed G3107 [are] they that have not G3361 seen G1492 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 [yet] have believed G4100 (AorActPtc).
020:030 And G2532 many G4183 other G0243 signs G4592 truly G3303 G3767 did G4160 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 in the presence G1799 of his G0846 disciples G3101, which G3739 are G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 this G5129 book G0975:
020:031 But G1161 these G5023 are written G1125 (PerfPasInd), that G2443 ye might believe G4100 (AorActSubj) that G3754 Jesus G2424 is G2076 (PresInd) the Christ G5547, the Son G5207 of God G2316; and G2532 that G2443 believing G4100 (PresActPtc) ye might have G2192 (PresActSubj) life G2222 through G1722 his G0846 name G3686.
021:001 ¶  After G3326 these things G5023 Jesus G2424 shewed G5319 (AorActInd) himself G1438 again G3825 to the disciples G3101 at G1909 the sea G2281 of Tiberias G5085; and G1161 on this wise G3779 shewed G5319 (AorActInd) he [himself].
021:002 There were G2258 (ImpfInd) together G3674 Simon G4613 Peter G4074, and G2532 Thomas G2381 called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Didymus G1324, and G2532 Nathanael G3482 of G0575 Cana G2580 in Galilee G1056, and G2532 the [sons] G3588 of Zebedee G2199, and G2532 two G1417 other G0243 of G1537 his G0846 disciples G3101.
021:003 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, I go G5217 (PresActInd) a fishing G0232 (PresActInf). They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, We G2249 also G2532 go G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) with G4862 thee G4671. They went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 entered G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a ship G4143 immediately G2117; and G2532 that G1722 G1565 night G3571 they caught G4084 (AorActInd) nothing G3762.
021:004 But G1161 when the morning G4405 was G1096 now G2235 come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), Jesus G2424 stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) on G1519 the shore G0123: but G3305 the disciples G3101 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 it was G2076 (PresInd) Jesus G2424.
021:005 Then G3767 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Children G3813, have ye G2192 (PresActInd) any G3387 meat G4371? They answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, No G3756.
021:006 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Cast G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) the net G1350 on G1519 the right G1188 side G3313 of the ship G4143, and G2532 ye shall find G2147 (FutActInd). They cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) therefore G3767, and G2532 now G3765 they were G2480 not G3765 able G2480 (AorActInd) to draw G1670 (AorActInf) it G0846 for G0575 the multitude G4128 of fishes G2486.
021:007 Therefore G3767 that G1565 disciple G3101 whom G3739 Jesus G2424 loved G0025 (ImpfActInd) saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto Peter G4074, It is G2076 (PresInd) the Lord G2962. Now G3767 when Simon G4613 Peter G4074 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 it was G2076 (PresInd) the Lord G2962, he girt G1241 (AorMidInd) [his] fisher’s coat G1903 [unto him], (for G1063 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) naked G1131,) and G2532 did cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) himself G1438 into G1519 the sea G2281.
021:008 And G1161 the other G0243 disciples G3101 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) in a little ship G4142; (for G1063 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3756 far G3112 from G0575 land G1093, but G0235 as it were G5613 G0575 two hundred G1250 cubits G4083,) dragging G4951 (PresActPtc) the net G1350 with fishes G2486.
021:009 As soon G5613 then G3767 as they were come G0576 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 land G1093, they saw G0991 (PresActInd) a fire of coals G0439 there, and G2532 fish G3795 laid G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc) thereon G1945 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 bread G0740.
021:010 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Bring G5342 (AorActImpr) of G0575 the fish G3795 which G3739 ye have G4084 now G3568 caught G4084 (AorActInd).
021:011 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 drew G1670 (AorActInd) the net G1350 to G1909 land G1093 full G3324 of great G3173 fishes G2486, an hundred G1540 and fifty G4004 and three G5140: and G2532 for all there were so many G5118, yet was G5607 (PresPtc) not G3756 the net G1350 broken G4977 (AorPasInd).
021:012 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Come G1205 (Impr) [and] dine G0709 (AorActImpr). And G1161 none G3762 of the disciples G3101 durst G5111 (ImpfActInd) ask G1833 (AorActInf) him G0846, Who G5101 art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771? knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 it was G2076 (PresInd) the Lord G2962.
021:013 Jesus G2424 then G3767 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 taketh G2983 (PresActInd) bread G0740, and G2532 giveth G1325 (PresActInd) them G0846, and G2532 fish G3795 likewise G3668.
021:014 This G5124 is G5319 now G2235 the third time G5154 that Jesus G2424 shewed himself G5319 (AorPasInd) to his G0846 disciples G3101, after that he was risen G1453 (AorPasPtc) from G1537 the dead G3498.
021:015 So G3767 when G3753 they had dined G0709 (AorActInd), Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) to Simon G4613 Peter G4074, Simon G4613, [son] of Jonas G2495, lovest thou G0025 (PresActInd) me G3165 more than G4119 these G5130? He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Yea G3483, Lord G2962; thou G4771 knowest G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 I love G5368 (PresActInd) thee G4571. He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Feed G1006 (PresActImpr) my G3450 lambs G0721.
021:016 He saith G3004 (PresActInd) to him G0846 again G3825 the second time G1208, Simon G4613, [son] of Jonas G2495, lovest thou G0025 (PresActInd) me G3165? He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Yea G3483, Lord G2962; thou G4771 knowest G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 I love G5368 (PresActInd) thee G4571. He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Feed G4165 (PresActImpr) my G3450 sheep G4263.
021:017 He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846 the third G5154 time, Simon G4613, [son] of Jonas G2495, lovest G5368 (PresActInd) thou me G3165? Peter G4074 was grieved G3076 (AorPasInd) because G3754 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846 the third G5154 time, Lovest G5368 (PresActInd) thou me G3165? And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, thou G4771 knowest G1492 (PerfActInd) all things G3956; thou G4771 knowest G1097 (PresActInd) that G3754 I love G5368 (PresActInd) thee G4571. Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Feed G1006 (PresActImpr) my G3450 sheep G4263.
021:018 Verily G0281, verily G0281, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, When G3753 thou wast G2258 (ImpfInd) young G3501, thou girdedst G2224 (ImpfActInd) thyself G4572, and G2532 walkedst G4043 (ImpfActInd) whither G3699 thou wouldest G2309 (ImpfActInd): but G1161 when G3752 thou shalt be old G1095 (AorActSubj), thou shalt stretch forth G1614 (FutActInd) thy G4675 hands G5495, and G2532 another G0243 shall gird G2224 (FutActInd) thee G4571, and G2532 carry G5342 (FutActInd) [thee] whither G3699 thou wouldest G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756.
021:019 G1161 This G5124 spake he G2036 (Aor2ActInd), signifying G4591 (PresActPtc) by what G4169 death G2288 he should glorify G1392 (FutActInd) God G2316. And G2532 when he had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) this G5124, he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
021:020 Then G1161 Peter G4074, turning about G1994 (Aor2PasPtc), seeth G0991 (PresActInd) the disciple G3101 whom G3739 Jesus G2424 loved G0025 (ImpfActInd) following G0190 (PresActPtc); which G3739 also G2532 leaned G0377 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 his G0846 breast G4738 at G1722 supper G1173, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, which G5101 is he G2076 (PresInd) that betrayeth G3860 (PresActPtc) thee G4571?
021:021 Peter G4074 seeing G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G5126 saith G3004 (PresActInd) to Jesus G2424, Lord G2962, and G1161 what G5101 [shall] this man G3778 [do]?
021:022 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, If G1437 I will G2309 (PresActSubj) that he G0846 tarry G3306 (PresActInf) till G2193 I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), what G5101 [is that] to G4314 thee G4571? follow G0190 (PresActImpr) thou G4771 me G3427.
021:023 Then G3767 went G1831 this G3778 saying G3056 abroad G1831 (Aor2ActInd) among G1519 the brethren G0080, that G3754 that G1565 disciple G3101 should G0599 not G3756 die G0599 (PresActInd): yet G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 unto him G0846, G3754 He shall G0599 not G3756 die G0599 (PresActInd); but G0235, If G1437 I will G2309 (PresActSubj) that he G0846 tarry G3306 (PresActInf) till G2193 I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), what G5101 [is that] to G4314 thee G4571?
021:024 This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the disciple G3101 which G3588 testifieth G3140 (PresActPtc) of G4012 these things G5130, and G2532 wrote G1125 (AorActPtc) these things G5023: and G2532 we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 his G0846 testimony G3141 is G2076 (PresInd) true G0227.
021:025 And G1161 there are G2076 (PresInd) also G2532 many G4183 other things G0243 which G3745 Jesus G2424 did G4160 (AorActInd), the which G3748, if G1437 they should be written G1125 (PresPasSubj) every G2596 one G1520, I suppose G3633 (PresMidPasDepInd) that even G3761 the world G2889 itself G0846 could not G3761 contain G5562 (AorActInf) the books G0975 that should be written G1125 (PresPasPtc). Amen G0281.
