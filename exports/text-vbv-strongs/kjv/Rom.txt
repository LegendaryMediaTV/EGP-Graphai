001:001 ¶  Paul G3972, a servant G1401 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, called G2822 [to be] an apostle G0652, separated G0873 (PerfPasPtc) unto G1519 the gospel G2098 of God G2316,
001:002 (Which G3739 he had promised afore G4279 (AorMidDepInd) by G1223 his G0846 prophets G4396 in G1722 the holy G0040 scriptures G1124,)
001:003 Concerning G4012 his G0846 Son G5207 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 our G2257 Lord G2962, which G3588 was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) of G1537 the seed G4690 of David G1138 according G2596 to the flesh G4561;
001:004 And declared G3724 (AorPasPtc) [to be] the Son G5207 of God G2316 with G1722 power G1411, according G2596 to the spirit G4151 of holiness G0042, by G1537 the resurrection G0386 from the dead G3498:
001:005 By G1223 whom G3739 we have received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) grace G5485 and G2532 apostleship G0651, for G1519 obedience G5218 to the faith G4102 among G1722 all G3956 nations G1484, for G5228 his G0846 name G3686:
001:006 Among G1722 whom G3739 are G2075 (PresInd) ye G5210 also G2532 the called G2822 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547:
001:007 To all G3956 that be G5607 (PresPtc) in G1722 Rome G4516, beloved G0027 of God G2316, called G2822 [to be] saints G0040: Grace G5485 to you G5213 and G2532 peace G1515 from G0575 God G2316 our G2257 Father G3962, and G2532 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
001:008 First G4412 G3303, I thank G2168 (PresActInd) my G3450 God G2316 through G1223 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 for G5228 you G5216 all G3956, that G3754 your G5216 faith G4102 is spoken G2605 (PresPasInd) of throughout G1722 the whole G3650 world G2889.
001:009 For G1063 God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 witness G3144, whom G3739 I serve G3000 (PresActInd) with G1722 my G3450 spirit G4151 in G1722 the gospel G2098 of his G0846 Son G5207, that G5613 without ceasing G0089 I make G4160 (PresMidInd) mention G3417 of you G5216 always G3842 in G1909 my G3450 prayers G4335;
001:010 Making request G1189 (PresMidPasDepPtc), if by any means G1513 now G2235 at length G4218 I might have a prosperous journey G2137 (FutPasInd) by G1722 the will G2307 of God G2316 to come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) unto G4314 you G5209.
001:011 For G1063 I long G1971 (PresActInd) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) you G5209, that G2443 I may impart G3330 (Aor2ActSubj) unto you G5213 some G5100 spiritual G4152 gift G5486, to the end G1519 ye G5209 may be established G4741 (AorPasInf);
001:012 That G1161 G5124 is G2076 (PresInd), that I may be comforted together G4837 (AorPasInf) with G1722 you G5213 by G1223 G1722 the mutual G0240 faith G4102 both G5037 of you G5216 and G2532 me G1700.
001:013 Now G1161 I would G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756 have G0050 you G5209 ignorant G0050 (PresActInf), brethren G0080, that G3754 oftentimes G4178 I purposed G4388 (Aor2MidInd) to come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) unto G4314 you G5209, (but G2532 was let G2967 (AorPasInd) hitherto G0891 G1204,) that G2443 I might have G2192 (Aor2ActSubj) some G5100 fruit G2590 among G1722 you G5213 also G2532, even as G2531 G2532 among G1722 other G3062 Gentiles G1484.
001:014 I am G1510 (PresInd) debtor G3781 both G5037 to the Greeks G1672, and G2532 to the Barbarians G0915; both G5037 to the wise G4680, and G2532 to the unwise G0453.
001:015 So G3779, as much as G2596 in me is G1691, I am ready G4289 to preach the gospel G2097 (AorMidInf) to you G5213 that are at G1722 Rome G4516 also G2532.
001:016 For G1063 I am G1870 not G3756 ashamed G1870 (PresMidPasDepInd) of the gospel G2098 of Christ G5547: for G1063 it is G2076 (PresInd) the power G1411 of God G2316 unto G1519 salvation G4991 to every one G3956 that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc); to the Jew G2453 first G4412, and G5037 also G2532 to the Greek G1672.
001:017 For G1063 therein G1722 G0846 is G0601 the righteousness G1343 of God G2316 revealed G0601 (PresPasInd) from G1537 faith G4102 to G1519 faith G4102: as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), G1161 The just G1342 shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd) by G1537 faith G4102.
001:018 For G1063 the wrath G3709 of God G2316 is revealed G0601 (PresPasInd) from G0575 heaven G3772 against G1909 all G3956 ungodliness G0763 and G2532 unrighteousness G0093 of men G0444, who hold G2722 (PresActPtc) the truth G0225 in G1722 unrighteousness G0093;
001:019 Because G1360 that which may be known G1110 of God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) manifest G5318 in G1722 them G0846; for G1063 God G2316 hath shewed G5319 (AorActInd) [it] unto them G0846.
001:020 For G1063 the invisible things G0517 of him G0846 from G0575 the creation G2937 of the world G2889 are clearly seen G2529 (PresPasInd), being understood G3539 (PresPasPtc) by the things that are made G4161, [even] G5037 his G0846 eternal G0126 power G1411 and G2532 Godhead G2305; so G1519 that they G0846 are G1511 (PresInf) without excuse G0379:
001:021 Because G1360 that, when they knew G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) God G2316, they glorified G1392 (AorActInd) [him] not G3756 as G5613 God G2316, neither G2228 were thankful G2168 (AorActInd); but G0235 became vain G3154 (AorPasInd) in G1722 their G0846 imaginations G1261, and G2532 their G0846 foolish G0801 heart G2588 was darkened G4654 (AorPasInd).
001:022 Professing themselves G5335 (PresActPtc) to be G1511 (PresInf) wise G4680, they became fools G3471 (AorPasInd),
001:023 And G2532 changed G0236 (AorActInd) the glory G1391 of the uncorruptible G0862 God G2316 into G1722 an image G1504 made like G3667 to corruptible G5349 man G0444, and G2532 to birds G4071, and G2532 fourfooted beasts G5074, and G2532 creeping things G2062.
001:024 Wherefore G1352 God G2316 also G2532 gave G3860 them G0846 up G3860 (AorActInd) to G1519 uncleanness G0167 through G1722 the lusts G1939 of their own G0846 hearts G2588, to dishonour G0818 (PresMidPasInf) their own G0846 bodies G4983 between G1722 themselves G1438:
001:025 Who G3748 changed G3337 (AorActInd) the truth G0225 of God G2316 into G1722 a lie G5579, and G2532 worshipped G4573 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 served G3000 (AorActInd) the creature G2937 more than G3844 the Creator G2936 (AorActPtc), who G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) blessed G2128 for G1519 ever G0165. Amen G0281.
001:026 For G1223 this G5124 cause God G2316 gave G3860 them G0846 up G3860 (AorActInd) unto G1519 vile G0819 affections G3806: for G1063 even G5037 their G0846 women G2338 did change G3337 (AorActInd) the natural G5446 use G5540 into G1519 that which is against G3844 nature G5449:
001:027 And G5037 likewise G3668 also G2532 the men G0730, leaving G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) the natural G5446 use G5540 of the woman G2338, burned G1572 (AorPasInd) in G1722 their G0846 lust G3715 one toward another G1519 G0240; men G0730 with G1722 men G0730 working G2716 (PresMidPasDepPtc) that which is unseemly G0808, and G2532 receiving G0618 (PresActPtc) in G1722 themselves G1438 that recompence G0489 of their G0846 error G4106 which G3739 was meet G1163 (ImpfInd).
001:028 And G2532 even as G2531 they did G1381 not G3756 like G1381 (AorActInd) to retain G2192 (PresActInf) God G2316 in G1722 [their] knowledge G1922, God G2316 gave G3860 them G0846 over G3860 (AorActInd) to G1519 a reprobate G0096 mind G3563, to do G4160 (PresActInf) those things which are G2520 not G3361 convenient G2520 (PresActPtc);
001:029 Being filled with G4137 (PerfPasPtc) all G3956 unrighteousness G0093, fornication G4202, wickedness G4189, covetousness G4124, maliciousness G2549; full G3324 of envy G5355, murder G5408, debate G2054, deceit G1388, malignity G2550; whisperers G5588,
001:030 Backbiters G2637, haters of God G2319, despiteful G5197, proud G5244, boasters G0213, inventors G2182 of evil things G2556, disobedient G0545 to parents G1118,
001:031 Without understanding G0801, covenantbreakers G0802, without natural affection G0794, implacable G0786, unmerciful G0415:
001:032 Who G3748 knowing G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) the judgment G1345 of God G2316, that G3754 they which commit G4238 (PresActPtc) such things G5108 are G1526 (PresInd) worthy G0514 of death G2288, not G3756 only G3440 do G4160 (PresActInd) the same G0846, but G0235 G2532 have pleasure G4909 (PresActInd) in them that do G4238 (PresActPtc) them.
002:001 ¶  Therefore G1352 thou art G1488 (PresInd) inexcusable G0379, O G5599 man G0444, whosoever G3956 thou art that judgest G2919 (PresActPtc): for G1063 wherein G1722 G3739 thou judgest G2919 (PresActInd) another G2087, thou condemnest G2632 (PresActInd) thyself G4572; for G1063 thou that judgest G2919 (PresActPtc) doest G4238 (PresActInd) the same things G0846.
002:002 But G1161 we are sure G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 the judgment G2917 of God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) according G2596 to truth G0225 against G1909 them which commit G4238 (PresActPtc) such things G5108.
002:003 And G1161 thinkest thou G3049 (PresMidPasDepInd) this G5124, O G5599 man G0444, that judgest G2919 (PresActPtc) them which do G4238 (PresActPtc) such things G5108, and G2532 doest G4160 (PresActPtc) the same G0846, that G3754 thou G4771 shalt escape G1628 (FutMidDepInd) the judgment G2917 of God G2316?
002:004 Or G2228 despisest thou G2706 (PresActInd) the riches G4149 of his G0846 goodness G5544 and G2532 forbearance G0463 and G2532 longsuffering G3115; not knowing G0050 (PresActPtc) that G3754 the goodness G5543 of God G2316 leadeth G0071 (PresActInd) thee G4571 to G1519 repentance G3341?
002:005 But G1161 after G2596 thy G4675 hardness G4643 and G2532 impenitent G0279 heart G2588 treasurest up G2343 (PresActInd) unto thyself G4572 wrath G3709 against G1722 the day G2250 of wrath G3709 and G2532 revelation G0602 of the righteous judgment G1341 of God G2316;
002:006 Who G3739 will render G0591 (FutActInd) to every man G1538 according G2596 to his G0846 deeds G2041:
002:007 To them who by G3303 G2596 patient continuance G5281 in well G0018 doing G2041 seek G2212 (PresActPtc) for glory G1391 and G2532 honour G5092 and G2532 immortality G0861, eternal G0166 life G2222:
002:008 But G1161 unto them that are contentious G1537 G2052, and G2532 do not obey G0544 (PresActPtc) G3303 the truth G0225, but G1161 obey G3982 (PresMidPtc) unrighteousness G0093, indignation G2372 and G2532 wrath G3709,
002:009 Tribulation G2347 and G2532 anguish G4730, upon G1909 every G3956 soul G5590 of man G0444 that doeth G2716 (PresMidPasDepPtc) evil G2556, of the Jew G2453 first G4412, and G5037 also G2532 of the Gentile G1672;
002:010 But G1161 G2532 glory G1391, honour G5092, and G2532 peace G1515, to every man G3956 that worketh G2038 (PresMidPasDepPtc) good G0018, to the Jew G2453 first G4412, and G5037 also G2532 to the Gentile G1672:
002:011 For G1063 there is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 respect of persons G4382 with G3844 God G2316.
002:012 For G1063 as many as G3745 have sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd) without law G0460 shall G0622 also G2532 perish G0622 (FutMidInd) without law G0460: and G2532 as many as G3745 have sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the law G3551 shall be judged G2919 (FutPasInd) by G1223 the law G3551;
002:013 (For G1063 not G3756 the hearers G0202 of the law G3551 [are] just G1342 before G3844 God G2316, but G0235 the doers G4163 of the law G3551 shall be justified G1344 (FutPasInd).
002:014 For G1063 when G3752 the Gentiles G1484, which G3588 have G2192 (PresActPtc) not G3361 the law G3551, do G4160 (PresActSubj) by nature G5449 the things G3588 contained in the law G3551, these G3778, having G2192 (PresActPtc) not G3361 the law G3551, are G1526 (PresInd) a law G3551 unto themselves G1438:
002:015 Which G3748 shew G1731 (PresMidInd) the work G2041 of the law G3551 written G1123 in G1722 their G0846 hearts G2588, their G0846 conscience G4893 also bearing witness G4828 (PresActPtc), and G2532 [their] thoughts G3053 the mean while accusing G2723 (PresActPtc) or G2228 else G2532 excusing G0626 (PresMidPasDepPtc) one another G3342 G0240;)
002:016 In G1722 the day G2250 when G3753 God G2316 shall judge G2919 (FutActInd/PresActInd) the secrets G2927 of men G0444 by G1223 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 according G2596 to my G3450 gospel G2098.
002:017 Behold G2396, thou G4771 art called G2028 (PresPasInd) a Jew G2453, and G2532 restest G1879 (PresMidPasDepInd) in the law G3551, and G2532 makest thy boast G2744 (PresMidPasDepInd) of G1722 God G2316,
002:018 And G2532 knowest G1097 (PresActInd) [his] will G2307, and G2532 approvest G1381 (PresActInd) the things that are more excellent G1308 (PresActPtc), being instructed G2727 (PresPasPtc) out of G1537 the law G3551;
002:019 And G5037 art confident G3982 (Perf2ActInd) that thou thyself G4572 art G1511 (PresInf) a guide G3595 of the blind G5185, a light G5457 of them which are in G1722 darkness G4655,
002:020 An instructor G3810 of the foolish G0878, a teacher G1320 of babes G3516, which hast G2192 (PresActPtc) the form G3446 of knowledge G1108 and G2532 of the truth G0225 in G1722 the law G3551.
002:021 Thou therefore G3767 which G3588 teachest G1321 (PresActPtc) another G2087, teachest thou G1321 (PresActInd) not G3756 thyself G4572? thou that preachest G2784 (PresActPtc) a man should G2813 not G3361 steal G2813 (PresActInf), dost thou steal G2813 (PresActInd)?
002:022 Thou that sayest G3004 (PresActPtc) a man should G3431 not G3361 commit adultery G3431 (PresActInf), dost thou commit adultery G3431 (PresActInd)? thou that abhorrest G0948 (PresMidPasDepPtc) idols G1497, dost thou commit sacrilege G2416 (PresActInd)?
002:023 Thou G3739 that makest thy boast G2744 (PresMidPasDepInd) of G1722 the law G3551, through G1223 breaking G3847 the law G3551 dishonourest thou G0818 (PresActInd) God G2316?
002:024 For G1063 the name G3686 of God G2316 is blasphemed G0987 (PresPasInd) among G1722 the Gentiles G1484 through G1223 you G5209, as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd).
002:025 For G1063 circumcision G4061 verily G3303 profiteth G5623 (PresActInd), if G1437 thou keep G4238 (PresActSubj) the law G3551: but G1161 if G1437 thou be G5600 (PresSubj) a breaker G3848 of the law G3551, thy G4675 circumcision G4061 is made G1096 (Perf2ActInd) uncircumcision G0203.
002:026 Therefore G3767 if G1437 the uncircumcision G0203 keep G5442 (PresActSubj) the righteousness G1345 of the law G3551, shall G3049 not G3780 his G0846 uncircumcision G0203 be counted G3049 (FutPasInd) for G1519 circumcision G4061?
002:027 And G2532 shall not G2919 uncircumcision G0203 which is by G1537 nature G5449, if it fulfil G5055 (PresActPtc) the law G3551, judge G2919 (FutActInd) thee G4571, who by G1223 the letter G1121 and G2532 circumcision G4061 dost transgress G3848 the law G3551?
002:028 For G1063 he is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 a Jew G2453, which is one outwardly G1722 G5318; neither G3761 [is that] circumcision G4061, which is outward G1722 G5318 in G1722 the flesh G4561:
002:029 But G0235 he [is] a Jew G2453, which is one inwardly G1722 G2927; and G2532 circumcision G4061 [is that] of the heart G2588, in G1722 the spirit G4151, [and] not G3756 in the letter G1121; whose G3739 praise G1868 [is] not G3756 of G1537 men G0444, but G0235 of G1537 God G2316.
003:001 ¶  What G5101 advantage G4053 then G3767 hath the Jew G2453? or G2228 what G5101 profit G5622 [is there] of circumcision G4061?
003:002 Much G4183 every G2596 G3956 way G5158: chiefly G4412, because G3303 G1063 that G3754 unto them were committed G4100 (AorPasInd) the oracles G3051 of God G2316.
003:003 For G1063 what G5101 if G1487 some G5100 did not believe G0569 (AorActInd)? G3361 shall G2673 their G0846 unbelief G0570 make G2673 the faith G4102 of God G2316 without effect G2673 (FutActInd)?
003:004 God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt): yea G1161, let G1096 God G2316 be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) true G0227, but G1161 every G3956 man G0444 a liar G5583; as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), That G3704 thou mightest G0302 be justified G1344 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 thy G4675 sayings G3056, and G2532 mightest overcome G3528 (AorActSubj) when G1722 thou G4571 art judged G2919 (PresPasInf).
003:005 But G1161 if G1487 our G2257 unrighteousness G0093 commend G4921 (PresActInd) the righteousness G1343 of God G2316, what G5101 shall we say G2046 (FutActInd)? G3361 [Is] God G2316 unrighteous G0094 who taketh G2018 (PresActPtc) vengeance G3709? (I speak G3004 (PresActInd) as G2596 a man G0444 )
003:006 God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt): for then G1893 how G4459 shall G2919 God G2316 judge G2919 (FutActInd/PresActInd) the world G2889?
003:007 For G1063 if G1487 the truth G0225 of God G2316 hath more abounded G4052 (AorActInd) through G1722 my G1699 lie G5582 unto G1519 his G0846 glory G1391; why G5101 yet G2089 am G2919 I also G2504 judged G2919 (PresPasInd) as G5613 a sinner G0268?
003:008 And G2532 not G3361 [rather], (as G2531 we be slanderously reported G0987 (PresPasInd), and G2532 as G2531 some G5100 affirm G5346 (PresInd) that we G2248 say G3004 (PresActInf),) G3754 Let us do G4160 (AorActSubj) evil G2556, that G2443 good G0018 may come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj)? whose G3739 damnation G2917 is G2076 (PresInd) just G1738.
003:009 What G5101 then G3767? are we better G4284 (PresMidPasDepInd) [than they]? No G3756, in no wise G3843: for G1063 we have before proved G4256 (AorMidDepInd) both G5037 Jews G2453 and G2532 Gentiles G1672, that they are G1511 (PresInf) all G3956 under G5259 sin G0266;
003:010 As G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), G3754 There is G2076 (PresInd) none G3756 righteous G1342, no, not G3761 one G1520:
003:011 There is G2076 (PresInd) none G3756 that understandeth G4920 (PresActPtc), there is G2076 (PresInd) none G3756 that seeketh after G1567 (PresActPtc) God G2316.
003:012 They are G1578 all G3956 gone out of the way G1578 (AorActInd), they are G0889 together G0260 become unprofitable G0889 (AorPasInd); there is G2076 (PresInd) none G3756 that doeth G4160 (PresActPtc) good G5544, no, not G3756 one G2076 (PresInd) G2193 G1520.
003:013 Their G0846 throat G2995 [is] an open G0455 (PerfPasPtc) sepulchre G5028; with their G0846 tongues G1100 they have used deceit G1387 (ImpfActInd); the poison G2447 of asps G0785 [is] under G5259 their G0846 lips G5491:
003:014 Whose G3739 mouth G4750 [is] full G1073 (PresActInd) of cursing G0685 and G2532 bitterness G4088:
003:015 Their G0846 feet G4228 [are] swift G3691 to shed G1632 (AorActInf) blood G0129:
003:016 Destruction G4938 and G2532 misery G5004 [are] in G1722 their G0846 ways G3598:
003:017 And G2532 the way G3598 of peace G1515 have G1097 they not G3756 known G1097 (Aor2ActInd):
003:018 There is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 fear G5401 of God G2316 before G0561 their G0846 eyes G3788.
003:019 Now G1161 we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 what things soever G3745 the law G3551 saith G3004 (PresActInd), it saith G2980 (PresActInd) to them who are under G1722 the law G3551: that G2443 every G3956 mouth G4750 may be stopped G5420 (Aor2PasSubj), and G2532 all G3956 the world G2889 may become G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) guilty G5267 before God G2316.
003:020 Therefore G1360 by G1537 the deeds G2041 of the law G3551 there shall G1344 no G3956 G3756 flesh G4561 be justified G1344 (FutPasInd) in his G0846 sight G1799: for G1063 by G1223 the law G3551 [is] the knowledge G1922 of sin G0266.
003:021 But G1161 now G3570 the righteousness G1343 of God G2316 without G5565 the law G3551 is manifested G5319 (PerfPasInd), being witnessed G3140 (PresPasPtc) by G5259 the law G3551 and G2532 the prophets G4396;
003:022 Even G1161 the righteousness G1343 of God G2316 [which is] by G1223 faith G4102 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 unto G1519 all G3956 and G2532 upon G1909 all G3956 them that believe G4100 (PresActPtc): for G1063 there is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 difference G1293:
003:023 For G1063 all G3956 have sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 come short G5302 (PresPasInd) of the glory G1391 of God G2316;
003:024 Being justified G1344 (PresPasPtc) freely G1432 by his G0846 grace G5485 through G1223 the redemption G0629 that is in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424:
003:025 Whom G3739 God G2316 hath set forth G4388 (Aor2MidInd) [to be] a propitiation G2435 through G1223 faith G4102 in G1722 his G0846 blood G0129, to G1519 declare G1732 his G0846 righteousness G1343 for G1223 the remission G3929 of sins G0265 that are past G4266 (PerfActPtc), through G1722 the forbearance G0463 of God G2316;
003:026 To G4314 declare G1732, [I say], at G1722 this G3568 time G2540 his G0846 righteousness G1343: that G1519 he might be G1511 (PresInf) just G1342, and G2532 the justifier G1344 (PresActPtc) of him G0846 which believeth G4102 in G1537 Jesus G2424.
003:027 Where G4226 [is] boasting G2746 then G3767? It is excluded G1576 (AorPasInd). By G1223 what G4169 law G3551? of works G2041? Nay G3780: but G0235 by G1223 the law G3551 of faith G4102.
003:028 Therefore G3767 we conclude G3049 (PresMidPasDepInd) that a man G0444 is justified G1344 (PresPasInf) by faith G4102 without G5565 the deeds G2041 of the law G3551.
003:029 [Is he] G2228 the God G2316 of the Jews G2453 only G3440? [is he] not G3780 also G1161 G2532 of the Gentiles G1484? Yes G3483, of the Gentiles G1484 also G2532:
003:030 Seeing G1897 [it is] one G1520 God G2316, which G3739 shall justify G1344 (FutActInd) the circumcision G4061 by G1537 faith G4102, and G2532 uncircumcision G0203 through G1223 faith G4102.
003:031 Do we G2673 then G3767 make void G2673 (PresActInd) the law G3551 through G1223 faith G4102? God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt): yea G0235, we establish G2476 (PresActInd) the law G3551.
004:001 ¶  What G5101 shall we say G2046 (FutActInd) then G3767 that Abraham G0011 our G2257 father G3962, as pertaining G2596 to the flesh G4561, hath found G2147 (PerfActInf)?
004:002 For G1063 if G1487 Abraham G0011 were justified G1344 (AorPasInd) by G1537 works G2041, he hath G2192 (PresActInd) [whereof] to glory G2745; but G0235 not G3756 before G4314 God G2316.
004:003 For G1063 what G5101 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the scripture G1124? G1161 Abraham G0011 believed G4100 (AorActInd) God G2316, and G2532 it was counted G3049 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 for G1519 righteousness G1343.
004:004 Now G1161 to him that worketh G2038 (PresMidPasDepPtc) is G3049 the reward G3408 not G3756 reckoned G3049 (PresMidPasDepInd) of G2596 grace G5485, but G0235 of G2596 debt G3783.
004:005 But G1161 to him that worketh G2038 (PresMidPasDepPtc) not G3361, but G1161 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1909 him that justifieth G1344 (PresActPtc) the ungodly G0765, his G0846 faith G4102 is counted G3049 (PresMidPasDepInd) for G1519 righteousness G1343.
004:006 Even as G2509 David G1138 also G2532 describeth G3004 (PresActInd) the blessedness G3108 of the man G0444, unto whom G3739 God G2316 imputeth G3049 (PresMidPasDepInd) righteousness G1343 without G5565 works G2041,
004:007 [Saying], Blessed G3107 [are] they whose G3739 iniquities G0458 are forgiven G0863 (AorPasInd), and G2532 whose G3739 sins G0266 are covered G1943 (AorPasInd).
004:008 Blessed G3107 [is] the man G0435 to whom G3739 the Lord G2962 will G3049 not G3364 impute G3049 (AorMidDepSubj) sin G0266.
004:009 [Cometh] this G3778 blessedness G3108 then G3767 upon G1909 the circumcision G4061 [only], or G2228 upon G1909 the uncircumcision G0203 also G2532? for G1063 we say G3004 (PresActInd) that G3754 faith G4102 was reckoned G3049 (AorPasInd) to Abraham G0011 for G1519 righteousness G1343.
004:010 How G4459 was it G3049 then G3767 reckoned G3049 (AorPasInd)? when he was G5607 (PresPtc) in G1722 circumcision G4061, or G2228 in G1722 uncircumcision G0203? Not G3756 in G1722 circumcision G4061, but G0235 in G1722 uncircumcision G0203.
004:011 And G2532 he received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the sign G4592 of circumcision G4061, a seal G4973 of the righteousness G1343 of the faith G4102 which G3588 [he had yet] being G1722 uncircumcised G0203: that G1519 he G0846 might be G1511 (PresInf) the father G3962 of all G3956 them that believe G4100 (PresActPtc), though G1223 they be not circumcised G0203; that G1519 righteousness G1343 might be imputed G3049 (AorPasInf) unto them G0846 also G2532:
004:012 And G2532 the father G3962 of circumcision G4061 to them who are not G3756 of G1537 the circumcision G4061 only G3440, but G0235 who also G2532 walk G4748 (PresActPtc) in the steps G2487 of that faith G4102 of our G2257 father G3962 Abraham G0011, which [he had] being G1722 [yet] uncircumcised G0203.
004:013 For G1063 the promise G1860, that he should be G1511 (PresInf) the G0846 heir G2818 of the world G2889, [was] not G3756 to Abraham G0011, or G2228 to his G0846 seed G4690, through G1223 the law G3551, but G0235 through G1223 the righteousness G1343 of faith G4102.
004:014 For G1063 if G1487 they which are of G1537 the law G3551 [be] heirs G2818, faith G4102 is made void G2758 (PerfPasInd), and G2532 the promise G1860 made of none effect G2673 (PerfPasInd):
004:015 Because G1063 the law G3551 worketh G2716 (PresMidPasDepInd) wrath G3709: for G1063 where G3757 no G3756 law G3551 is G2076 (PresInd), [there is] no G3761 transgression G3847.
004:016 Therefore G1223 G5124 [it is] of G1537 faith G4102, that G2443 [it might be] by G2596 grace G5485; to the end G1519 the promise G1860 might be G1511 (PresInf) sure G0949 to all G3956 the seed G4690; not G3756 to that only G3440 which is of G1537 the law G3551, but G0235 to that also G2532 which is of G1537 the faith G4102 of Abraham G0011; who G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) the father G3962 of us G2257 all G3956,
004:017 (As G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), G3754 I have made G5087 (PerfActInd) thee G4571 a father G3962 of many G4183 nations G1484,) before G2713 him whom G3739 he believed G4100 (AorActInd), [even] God G2316, who quickeneth G2227 (PresActPtc) the dead G3498, and G2532 calleth G2564 (PresActPtc) those things which be G5607 (PresPtc) not G3361 as though G5613 they were G5607 (PresPtc).
004:018 Who G3739 against G3844 hope G1680 believed G4100 (AorActInd) in G1909 hope G1680, that G1519 he G0846 might become G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) the father G3962 of many G4183 nations G1484, according G2596 to that which was spoken G2046 (PerfPasPtc), So G3779 shall G2071 thy G4675 seed G4690 be G2071 (FutInd).
004:019 And G2532 being not G3361 weak G0770 (AorActPtc) in faith G4102, he considered G2657 (AorActInd) not G3756 his own G1438 body G4983 now G2235 dead G3499 (PerfPasPtc), when he was G5225 (PresActPtc) about G4225 an hundred years old G1541, neither yet G2532 the deadness G3500 of Sara’s G4564 womb G3388:
004:020 G1161 He staggered G1252 (AorPasInd) not G3756 at G1519 the promise G1860 of God G2316 through unbelief G0570; but G0235 was strong G1743 (AorPasInd) in faith G4102, giving G1325 (Aor2ActPtc) glory G1391 to God G2316;
004:021 And G2532 being fully persuaded G4135 (AorPasPtc) that G3754, what G3739 he had promised G1861 (PerfMidPasDepInd), he was G2076 (PresInd) able G1415 also G2532 to perform G4160 (AorActInf).
004:022 And G2532 therefore G1352 it was imputed G3049 (AorPasInd) to him G0846 for G1519 righteousness G1343.
004:023 Now G1161 it was G1125 not G3756 written G1125 (Aor2PasDepSubj) for his sake G1223 G0846 alone G3440, that G3754 it was imputed G3049 (AorPasInd) to him G0846;
004:024 But G0235 for G1223 us G2248 also G2532, to whom G3739 it shall be G3195 (PresActInd) imputed G3049 (PresPasInf), if we believe G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1909 him that raised up G1453 (AorActPtc) Jesus G2424 our G2257 Lord G2962 from G1537 the dead G3498;
004:025 Who G3739 was delivered G3860 (AorPasInd) for G1223 our G2257 offences G3900, and G2532 was raised again G1453 (AorPasInd) for G1223 our G2257 justification G1347.
005:001 ¶  Therefore G3767 being justified G1344 (AorPasPtc) by G1537 faith G4102, we have G2192 (PresActInd) peace G1515 with G4314 God G2316 through G1223 our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547:
005:002 By G1223 whom G3739 also G2532 we have G2192 (PerfActInd) access G4318 by faith G4102 into G1519 this G5026 grace G5485 wherein G1722 G3739 we stand G2476 (PerfActInd), and G2532 rejoice G2744 (PresMidPasDepInd) in G1909 hope G1680 of the glory G1391 of God G2316.
005:003 And G1161 not G3756 only G3440 [so], but G0235 we glory G2744 (PresMidPasDepInd) in G1722 tribulations G2347 also G2532: knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 tribulation G2347 worketh G2716 (PresMidPasDepInd) patience G5281;
005:004 And G1161 patience G5281, experience G1382; and G1161 experience G1382, hope G1680:
005:005 And G1161 hope G1680 maketh G2617 not G3756 ashamed G2617 (PresActInd); because G3754 the love G0026 of God G2316 is shed abroad G1632 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 our G2257 hearts G2588 by G1223 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 which G3588 is given G1325 (AorPasPtc) unto us G2254.
005:006 For G1063 when we G2257 were G5607 (PresPtc) yet G2089 without strength G0772, in due G2596 time G2540 Christ G5547 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) for G5228 the ungodly G0765.
005:007 For G1063 scarcely G3433 for G5228 a righteous man G1342 will G0599 one G5100 die G0599 (FutMidDepInd): yet G1063 peradventure G5029 for G5228 a good man G0018 some G5100 would G5111 even G2532 dare G5111 (PresActInd) to die G0599 (Aor2ActInf).
005:008 But G1161 God G2316 commendeth G4921 (PresActInd) his G1438 love G0026 toward G1519 us G2248, in that G3754, while we G2257 were G5607 (PresPtc) yet G2089 sinners G0268, Christ G5547 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) for G5228 us G2257.
005:009 Much G4183 more G3123 then G3767, being G1344 now G3568 justified G1344 (AorPasPtc) by G1722 his G0846 blood G0129, we shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd) from G0575 wrath G3709 through G1223 him G0846.
005:010 For G1063 if G1487, when we were G5607 (PresPtc) enemies G2190, we were reconciled G2644 (Aor2PasDepSubj) to God G2316 by G1223 the death G2288 of his G0846 Son G5207, much G4183 more G3123, being reconciled G2644 (Aor2PasPtc), we shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd) by G1722 his G0846 life G2222.
005:011 And G1161 not G3756 only G3440 [so], but G0235 we also G2532 joy G2744 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 God G2316 through G1223 our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, by G1223 whom G3739 we have G2983 now G3568 received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the atonement G2643.
005:012 Wherefore G1223 G5124, as G5618 by G1223 one G1520 man G0444 sin G0266 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the world G2889, and G2532 death G2288 by G1223 sin G0266; and G2532 so G3779 death G2288 passed G1330 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1519 all G3956 men G0444, for G1909 that G3739 all G3956 have sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd):
005:013 (For G1063 until G0891 the law G3551 sin G0266 was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the world G2889: but G1161 sin G0266 is G1677 not G3756 imputed G1677 (PresPasInd) when there is G5607 (PresPtc) no G3361 law G3551.
005:014 Nevertheless G0235 death G2288 reigned G0936 (AorActInd) from G0575 Adam G0076 to G3360 Moses G3475, even G2532 over G1909 them that had G0264 not G3361 sinned G0264 (AorActPtc) after G1909 the similitude G3667 of Adam’s G0076 transgression G3847, who G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) the figure G5179 of him that was to come G3195 (PresActPtc).
005:015 But G0235 not G3756 as G5613 the offence G3900, so G3779 also G2532 [is] the free gift G5486. For G1063 if G1487 through the offence G3900 of one G1520 many G4183 be dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd), much G4183 more G3123 the grace G5485 of God G2316, and G2532 the gift G1431 by G1722 grace G5485, [which is G3588 ] by one G1520 man G0444, Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, hath abounded G4052 (AorActInd) unto G1519 many G4183.
005:016 And G2532 not G3756 as G5613 [it was] by G1223 one G1520 that sinned G0264 (AorActPtc), [so is] the gift G1434: for G1063 G3303 the judgment G2917 [was] by G1537 one G1520 to G1519 condemnation G2631, but G1161 the free gift G5486 [is] of G1537 many G4183 offences G3900 unto G1519 justification G1345.
005:017 For G1063 if G1487 by one man’s G1520 offence G3900 death G2288 reigned G0936 (AorActInd) by G1223 one G1520; much G4183 more G3123 they which receive G2983 (PresActPtc) abundance G4050 of grace G5485 and G2532 of the gift G1431 of righteousness G1343 shall reign G0936 (FutActInd) in G1722 life G2222 by G1223 one G1520, Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.)
005:018 Therefore G0686 G3767 as G5613 by G1223 the offence G3900 of one G1520 [judgment came] upon G1519 all G3956 men G0444 to G1519 condemnation G2631; even G2532 so G3779 by G1223 the righteousness G1345 of one G1520 [the free gift came] upon G1519 all G3956 men G0444 unto G1519 justification G1347 of life G2222.
005:019 For G1063 as G5618 by G1223 one G1520 man’s G0444 disobedience G3876 many G4183 were made G2525 (AorPasInd) sinners G0268, so G3779 G2532 by G1223 the obedience G5218 of one G1520 shall G2525 many G4183 be made G2525 (FutPasInd) righteous G1342.
005:020 Moreover G1161 the law G3551 entered G3922 (Aor2ActInd), that G2443 the offence G3900 might abound G4121 (AorActSubj). But G1161 where G3757 sin G0266 abounded G4121 (AorActInd), grace G5485 did much more abound G5248 (AorActInd):
005:021 That G2443 as G5618 sin G0266 hath reigned G0936 (AorActInd) unto G1722 death G2288, even G2532 so G3779 might G0936 grace G5485 reign G0936 (AorActSubj) through G1223 righteousness G1343 unto G1519 eternal G0166 life G2222 by G1223 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 our G2257 Lord G2962.
006:001 ¶  What G5101 shall we say G2046 (FutActInd) then G3767? Shall we continue G1961 (FutActInd) in sin G0266, that G2443 grace G5485 may abound G4121 (AorActSubj)?
006:002 God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt). How G4459 shall we, that G3748 are dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd) to sin G0266, live G2198 (FutActInd) any longer G2089 therein G1722 G0846?
006:003 G2228 Know ye not G0050 (PresActInd), that so G3754 many of us G3745 as were baptized G0907 (AorPasInd) into G1519 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 were baptized G0907 (AorPasInd) into G1519 his G0846 death G2288?
006:004 Therefore G3767 we are buried with G4916 (Aor2PasDepSubj) him G0846 by G1223 baptism G0908 into G1519 death G2288: that G2443 like as G5618 Christ G5547 was raised up G1453 (AorPasInd) from G1537 the dead G3498 by G1223 the glory G1391 of the Father G3962, even so G3779 we G2249 also G2532 should walk G4043 (AorActSubj) in G1722 newness G2538 of life G2222.
006:005 For G1063 if G1487 we have been G1096 (Perf2ActInd) planted together G4854 in the likeness G3667 of his G0846 death G2288, we shall be G2071 (FutInd) also G0235 G2532 [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection G0386:
006:006 Knowing G1097 (PresActPtc) this G5124, that G3754 our G2257 old G3820 man G0444 is crucified with G4957 (AorPasInd) [him], that G2443 the body G4983 of sin G0266 might be destroyed G2673 (AorPasSubj), that henceforth G3371 we G2248 should G1398 not G3371 serve G1398 (PresActInf) sin G0266.
006:007 For G1063 he that is dead G0599 (Aor2ActPtc) is freed G1344 (PerfPasInd) from G0575 sin G0266.
006:008 Now G1161 if G1487 we be dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd) with G4862 Christ G5547, we believe G4100 (PresActInd) that G3754 we shall G4800 also G2532 live G4800 (FutActInd) with him G0846:
006:009 Knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 Christ G5547 being raised G1453 (AorPasPtc) from G1537 the dead G3498 dieth G0599 (PresActInd) no more G3765; death G2288 hath G2961 no more G3765 dominion over G2961 (PresActInd) him G0846.
006:010 For G3739 G1063 in that he died G0599 (Aor2ActInd), he died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) unto sin G0266 once G2178: but G1161 in that G3739 he liveth G2198 (PresActInd), he liveth G2198 (PresActInd) unto God G2316.
006:011 Likewise G3779 reckon G3049 (PresMidPasDepImpr) ye G5210 also G2532 yourselves G1438 to be G1511 (PresInf) dead G3498 indeed G3303 unto sin G0266, but G1161 alive G2198 (PresActPtc) unto God G2316 through G1722 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 our G2257 Lord G2962.
006:012 Let G0936 not G3361 sin G0266 therefore G3767 reign G0936 (PresActImpr) in G1722 your G5216 mortal G2349 body G4983, that G1519 ye should obey G5219 (PresActInf) it G0846 in G1722 the lusts G1939 thereof G0846.
006:013 Neither G3366 yield ye G3936 (PresActImpr) your G5216 members G3196 [as] instruments G3696 of unrighteousness G0093 unto sin G0266: but G0235 yield G3936 (AorActImpr) yourselves G1438 unto God G2316, as G5613 those that are alive G2198 (PresActPtc) from G1537 the dead G3498, and G2532 your G5216 members G3196 [as] instruments G3696 of righteousness G1343 unto God G2316.
006:014 For G1063 sin G0266 shall G2961 not G3756 have dominion over G2961 (FutActInd) you G5216: for G1063 ye are G2075 (PresInd) not G3756 under G5259 the law G3551, but G0235 under G5259 grace G5485.
006:015 What G5101 then G3767? shall we sin G0264 (FutActInd), because G3754 we are G2070 (PresInd) not G3756 under G5259 the law G3551, but G0235 under G5259 grace G5485? God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt).
006:016 Know ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756, that G3754 to whom G3739 ye yield G3936 (PresActInd) yourselves G1438 servants G1401 to G1519 obey G5218, his servants G1401 ye are G2075 (PresInd) to whom G3739 ye obey G5219 (PresActInd); whether G2273 of sin G0266 unto G1519 death G2288, or G2228 of obedience G5218 unto G1519 righteousness G1343?
006:017 But G1161 God G2316 be thanked G5485, that G3754 ye were G2258 (ImpfInd) the servants G1401 of sin G0266, but G1161 ye have obeyed G5219 (AorActInd) from G1537 the heart G2588 that form G5179 of doctrine G1322 which G1519 G3739 was delivered you G3860 (AorPasInd).
006:018 Being G1659 then G1161 made free G1659 (AorPasPtc) from G0575 sin G0266, ye became the servants G1402 (AorPasInd) of righteousness G1343.
006:019 I speak G3004 (PresActInd) after the manner of men G0442 because G1223 of the infirmity G0769 of your G5216 flesh G4561: for G1063 as G5618 ye have yielded G3936 (AorActInd) your G5216 members G3196 servants G1401 to uncleanness G0167 and G2532 to iniquity G0458 unto G1519 iniquity G0458; even so G3779 now G3568 yield G3936 (AorActImpr) your G5216 members G3196 servants G1401 to righteousness G1343 unto G1519 holiness G0038.
006:020 For G1063 when G3753 ye were G2258 (ImpfInd) the servants G1401 of sin G0266, ye were G2258 (ImpfInd) free G1658 from righteousness G1343.
006:021 What G5101 G3767 fruit G2590 had ye G2192 (ImpfActInd) then G5119 in G1909 those things whereof G3739 ye are G1870 now G3568 ashamed G1870 (PresMidPasDepInd)? for G1063 the end G5056 of those things G1565 [is] death G2288.
006:022 But G1161 now G3570 being made free G1659 (AorPasPtc) from G0575 sin G0266, and G1161 become servants G1402 (AorPasPtc) to God G2316, ye have G2192 (PresActInd) your G5216 fruit G2590 unto G1519 holiness G0038, and G1161 the end G5056 everlasting G0166 life G2222.
006:023 For G1063 the wages G3800 of sin G0266 [is] death G2288; but G1161 the gift G5486 of God G2316 [is] eternal G0166 life G2222 through G1722 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 our G2257 Lord G2962.
007:001 ¶  G2228 Know ye not G0050 (PresActInd), brethren G0080, (for G1063 I speak G2980 (PresActInd) to them that know G1097 (PresActPtc) the law G3551,) how that G3754 the law G3551 hath dominion over G2961 (PresActInd) a man G0444 as long as G1909 G3745 G5550 he liveth G2198 (PresActInd)?
007:002 For G1063 the woman G1135 which hath an husband G5220 is bound G1210 (PerfPasInd) by the law G3551 to [her] husband G0435 so long as he liveth G2198 (PresActPtc); but G1161 if G1437 the husband G0435 be dead G0599 (Aor2ActSubj), she is loosed G2673 (PerfPasInd) from G0575 the law G3551 of [her] husband G0435.
007:003 So then G0686 G3767 if G1437, while [her] husband G0435 liveth G2198 (PresActPtc), she be married G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) to another G2087 man G0435, she shall be called G5537 (FutActInd) an adulteress G3428: but G1161 if G1437 her husband G0435 be dead G0599 (Aor2ActSubj), she is G2076 (PresInd) free G1658 from G0575 that law G3551; so that she G0846 is G1511 (PresInf) no G3361 adulteress G3428, though she be married G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) to another G2087 man G0435.
007:004 Wherefore G5620, my G3450 brethren G0080, ye G5210 also G2532 are become dead G2289 (AorPasInd) to the law G3551 by G1223 the body G4983 of Christ G5547; that G1519 ye G5209 should be married G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) to another G2087, [even] to him who is raised G1453 (AorPasPtc) from G1537 the dead G3498, that G2443 we should bring forth fruit G2592 (AorActSubj) unto God G2316.
007:005 For G1063 when G3753 we were G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the flesh G4561, the motions G3804 of sins G0266, which G3588 were by G1223 the law G3551, did work G1754 (ImpfMidInd) in G1722 our G2257 members G3196 to bring G1519 forth fruit G2592 (AorActInf) unto death G2288.
007:006 But G1161 now G3570 we are delivered G2673 (AorPasInd) from G0575 the law G3551, that being dead G0599 (Aor2ActPtc) G0599 (Aor2ActPtc) wherein G1722 G3739 we were held G2722 (ImpfPasInd); that G5620 we G2248 should serve G1398 (PresActInf) in G1722 newness G2538 of spirit G4151, and G2532 not G3756 [in] the oldness G3821 of the letter G1121.
007:007 What G5101 shall we say G2046 (FutActInd) then G3767? [Is] the law G3551 sin G0266? God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt). Nay G0235, I had G1097 not G3756 known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) sin G0266, but G1508 by G1223 the law G3551: for G1063 G5037 I had G1492 not G3756 known G1492 (PlupfActInd) lust G1939, except G1508 the law G3551 had said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Thou shalt G1937 not G3756 covet G1937 (FutActInd).
007:008 But G1161 sin G0266, taking G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) occasion G0874 by G1223 the commandment G1785, wrought G2716 (AorMidDepInd) in G1722 me G1698 all manner of G3956 concupiscence G1939. For G1063 without G5565 the law G3551 sin G0266 [was] dead G3498.
007:009 For G1161 I G1473 was alive G2198 (ImpfActInd) without G5565 the law G3551 once G4218: but G1161 when the commandment G1785 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), sin G0266 revived G0326 (AorActInd), and G1161 I G1473 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd).
007:010 And G2532 the commandment G1785, which G3588 [was ordained] to G1519 life G2222, I G3427 found G2147 (AorPasInd) G3778 [to be] unto G1519 death G2288.
007:011 For G1063 sin G0266, taking G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) occasion G0874 by G1223 the commandment G1785, deceived G1818 (AorActInd) me G3165, and G2532 by G1223 it G0846 slew G0615 (AorActInd) [me].
007:012 Wherefore G5620 G3303 the law G3551 [is] holy G0040, and G2532 the commandment G1785 holy G0040, and G2532 just G1342, and G2532 good G0018.
007:013 Was then G3767 that which is good G0018 made G1096 (Perf2ActInd) death G2288 unto me G1698? God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt). But G0235 sin G0266, that G2443 it might appear G5316 (Aor2PasSubj) sin G0266, working G2716 (PresMidPasDepPtc) death G2288 in me G3427 by G1223 that which is good G0018; that G2443 sin G0266 by G1223 the commandment G1785 might become G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) exceeding G2596 G5236 sinful G0268.
007:014 For G1063 we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 the law G3551 is G2076 (PresInd) spiritual G4152: but G1161 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) carnal G4559, sold G4097 (PerfPasPtc) under G5259 sin G0266.
007:015 For G1063 that which G3739 I do G2716 (PresMidPasDepInd) I allow G1097 (PresActInd) not G3756: for G1063 what G3739 I would G2309 (PresActInd), that G5124 do I G4238 (PresActInd) not G3756; but G0235 what G3739 I hate G3404 (PresActInd), that G5124 do I G4160 (PresActInd).
007:016 If G1487 then G1161 I do G4160 (PresActInd) that G5124 which G3739 I would G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756, I consent G4852 (PresInd) unto the law G3551 that G3754 [it is] good G2570.
007:017 Now G3570 then G1161 it is no more G3765 I G1473 that do G2716 (PresMidPasDepInd) it G0846, but G0235 sin G0266 that dwelleth G3611 (PresActPtc) in G1722 me G1698.
007:018 For G1063 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 in G1722 me G1698 (that is G5123 (PresInd), in G1722 my G3450 flesh G4561,) dwelleth G3611 (PresActInd) no G3756 good thing G0018: for G1063 to will G2309 (PresActInf) is present G3873 (PresMidPasDepInd) with me G3427; but G1161 [how] to perform G2716 (PresMidPasDepInf) that which is good G2570 I find G2147 (PresActInd) not G3756.
007:019 For G1063 G3739 the good G0018 that I would G2309 (PresActInd) I do G4160 (PresActInd) not G3756: but G0235 the evil G2556 which G3739 I would G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756, that G5124 I do G4238 (PresActInd).
007:020 Now G1161 if G1487 G3739 I do G4160 (PresActInd) that G5124 I G1473 would G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756, it is no more G2089 G3765 I G1473 that do G2716 (PresMidPasDepInd) it G0846, but G0235 sin G0266 that dwelleth G3611 (PresActPtc) in G1722 me G1698.
007:021 I find G2147 (PresActInd) then G0686 a law G3551, that G3754, when I G1698 would G2309 (PresActPtc) do G4160 (PresActInf) good G2570, evil G2556 is present G3873 (PresMidPasDepInd) with me G1698.
007:022 For G1063 I delight G4913 (PresMidPasDepInd) in the law G3551 of God G2316 after G2596 the inward G2080 man G0444:
007:023 But G1161 I see G0991 (PresActInd) another G2087 law G3551 in G1722 my G3450 members G3196, warring against G0497 (PresMidPasDepPtc) the law G3551 of my G3450 mind G3563, and G2532 bringing G0163 me G3165 into captivity G0163 (PresActPtc) to the law G3551 of sin G0266 which G3588 is G5607 (PresPtc) in G1722 my G3450 members G3196.
007:024 O wretched G5005 man G0444 that I am G1473! who G5101 shall deliver G4506 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165 from G1537 the body G4983 of this G5127 death G2288?
007:025 I thank G2168 (PresActInd) God G2316 through G1223 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 our G2257 Lord G2962. So then G0686 G3767 with the mind G3563 I G1473 myself G0846 serve G3303 G1398 (PresActInd) the law G3551 of God G2316; but G1161 with the flesh G4561 the law G3551 of sin G0266.
008:001 ¶  [There is] therefore G0686 now G3568 no G3762 condemnation G2631 to them which are in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424, who walk G4043 (PresActPtc) not G3361 after G2596 the flesh G4561, but G0235 after G2596 the Spirit G4151.
008:002 For G1063 the law G3551 of the Spirit G4151 of life G2222 in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424 hath made G1659 me G3165 free G1659 (AorActInd) from G0575 the law G3551 of sin G0266 and G2532 death G2288.
008:003 For G1063 what the law G3551 could not do G0102, in G1722 that G3739 it was weak G0770 (ImpfActInd) through G1223 the flesh G4561, God G2316 sending G3992 (AorActPtc) his own G1438 Son G5207 in G1722 the likeness G3667 of sinful G0266 flesh G4561, and G2532 for G4012 sin G0266, condemned G2632 (AorActInd) sin G0266 in G1722 the flesh G4561:
008:004 That G2443 the righteousness G1345 of the law G3551 might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 us G2254, who walk G4043 (PresActPtc) not G3361 after G2596 the flesh G4561, but G0235 after G2596 the Spirit G4151.
008:005 For G1063 they that are G5607 (PresPtc) after G2596 the flesh G4561 do mind G5426 (PresActInd) the things G3588 of the flesh G4561; but G1161 they that are after G2596 the Spirit G4151 the things G3588 of the Spirit G4151.
008:006 For G1063 to be G5427 carnally G4561 minded G5427 [is] death G2288; but G1161 to be G5427 spiritually G4151 minded G5427 [is] life G2222 and G2532 peace G1515.
008:007 Because G1360 the carnal G4561 mind G5427 [is] enmity G2189 against G1519 God G2316: for G1063 it is G5293 not G3756 subject G5293 (PresPasInd) to the law G3551 of God G2316, neither G3761 indeed G1063 can be G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd).
008:008 So then G1161 they that are G5607 (PresPtc) in G1722 the flesh G4561 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) please G0700 (AorActInf) God G2316.
008:009 But G1161 ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) not G3756 in G1722 the flesh G4561, but G0235 in G1722 the Spirit G4151, if so be G1512 that the Spirit G4151 of God G2316 dwell G3611 (PresActInd) in G1722 you G5213. Now G1161 if any man G1536 have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 the Spirit G4151 of Christ G5547, he G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) none G3756 of his G0846.
008:010 And G1161 if G1487 Christ G5547 [be] in G1722 you G5213, the body G4983 G3303 [is] dead G3498 because G1223 of sin G0266; but G1161 the Spirit G4151 [is] life G2222 because G1223 of righteousness G1343.
008:011 But G1161 if G1487 the Spirit G4151 of him that raised up G1453 (AorActPtc) Jesus G2424 from G1537 the dead G3498 dwell G3611 (PresActInd) in G1722 you G5213, he that raised up G1453 (AorActPtc) Christ G5547 from G1537 the dead G3498 shall G2227 also G2532 quicken G2227 (FutActInd) your G5216 mortal G2349 bodies G4983 by G1223 his G0846 Spirit G4151 that dwelleth G1774 (PresActPtc) G1774 (PresActPtc) in G1722 you G5213.
008:012 Therefore G0686 G3767, brethren G0080, we are G2070 (PresInd) debtors G3781, not G3756 to the flesh G4561, to live G2198 (PresActInf) after G2596 the flesh G4561.
008:013 For G1063 if G1487 ye live G2198 (PresActInd) after G2596 the flesh G4561, ye shall G3195 (PresActInd) die G0599 (PresActInf): but G1161 if G1487 ye G2289 through the Spirit G4151 do mortify G2289 (PresActInd) the deeds G4234 of the body G4983, ye shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd).
008:014 For G1063 as many as G3745 are led G0071 (PresPasInd) by the Spirit G4151 of God G2316, they G3778 are G1526 (PresInd) the sons G5207 of God G2316.
008:015 For G1063 ye have G2983 not G3756 received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the spirit G4151 of bondage G1397 again G3825 to G1519 fear G5401; but G0235 ye have received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the Spirit G4151 of adoption G5206, whereby G1722 G3739 we cry G2896 (PresActInd), Abba G0005, Father G3962.
008:016 The Spirit G4151 itself G0846 beareth witness G4828 (PresActInd) with our G2257 spirit G4151, that G3754 we are G2070 (PresInd) the children G5043 of God G2316:
008:017 And G1161 if G1487 children G5043, then G2532 heirs G2818; heirs G2818 of God G3303 G2316, and G1161 joint-heirs G4789 with Christ G5547; if so be G1512 that we suffer with G4841 (PresActInd) [him], that G2443 we may be G4888 also G2532 glorified together G4888 (AorPasSubj).
008:018 For G1063 I reckon G3049 (PresMidPasDepInd) that G3754 the sufferings G3804 of this present G3568 time G2540 [are] not G3756 worthy G0514 [to be compared] with G4314 the glory G1391 which shall G3195 (PresActPtc) be revealed G0601 (AorPasInf) in G1519 us G2248.
008:019 For G1063 the earnest expectation G0603 of the creature G2937 waiteth G0553 (PresMidPasDepInd) for the manifestation G0602 of the sons G5207 of God G2316.
008:020 For G1063 the creature G2937 was made subject G5293 (Aor2PasDepSubj) to vanity G3153, not G3756 willingly G1635, but G0235 by reason G1223 of him who hath subjected G5293 (AorActPtc) [the same] in G1909 hope G1680,
008:021 Because G3754 the creature G2937 itself G0846 also G2532 shall be delivered G1659 (FutPasInd) from G0575 the bondage G1397 of corruption G5356 into G1519 the glorious G1391 liberty G1657 of the children G5043 of God G2316.
008:022 For G1063 we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 the whole G3956 creation G2937 groaneth G4959 (PresActInd) and G2532 travaileth in pain together G4944 (PresActInd) until G0891 now G3568.
008:023 And G1161 not G3756 only G3440 [they], but G0235 ourselves G0846 also G2532, which have G2192 (PresActPtc) the firstfruits G0536 of the Spirit G4151, even G2532 we G2249 ourselves G0846 groan G4727 (PresActInd) within G1722 ourselves G1438, waiting G0553 (PresMidPasDepPtc) for the adoption G5206, [to wit], the redemption G0629 of our G2257 body G4983.
008:024 For G1063 we are saved G4982 (AorPasInd) by hope G1680: but G1161 hope G1680 that is seen G0991 (PresPasPtc) is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 hope G1680: for G1063 what G3739 a man G5100 seeth G0991 (PresActInd), why G5101 doth he G1679 yet G2532 hope for G1679 (PresActInd)?
008:025 But G1161 if G1487 we hope G1679 (PresActInd) for that G3739 we see G0991 (PresActInd) not G3756, [then] do we G0553 with G1223 patience G5281 wait for G0553 (PresMidPasDepInd) [it].
008:026 G1161 Likewise G5615 the Spirit G4151 also G2532 helpeth G4878 (PresMidPasDepInd) our G2257 infirmities G0769: for G1063 we know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 we should pray for G4336 (AorMidDepSubj) as G2526 we ought G1163 (PresInd): but G0235 the Spirit G4151 itself G0846 maketh intercession G5241 (PresActInd) for G5228 us G2257 with groanings G4726 which cannot be uttered G0215.
008:027 And G1161 he that searcheth G2045 (PresActPtc) the hearts G2588 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) what G5101 [is] the mind G5427 of the Spirit G4151, because G3754 he maketh intercession G1793 (PresActInd) for G5228 the saints G0040 according G2596 to [the will of] God G2316.
008:028 And G1161 we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that all things G3956 work together G4903 (PresActInd) for G1519 good G0018 to them that G3754 love G0025 (PresActPtc) God G2316, to them who are G5607 (PresPtc) the called G2822 according G2596 to [his] purpose G4286.
008:029 For G3754 whom G3739 he did foreknow G4267 (AorActInd), he G4309 also G2532 did predestinate G4309 (AorActInd) [to be] conformed G4832 to the image G1504 of his G0846 Son G5207, that G1519 he G0846 might be G1511 (PresInf) the firstborn G4416 among G1722 many G4183 brethren G0080.
008:030 Moreover G1161 whom G3739 he did predestinate G4309 (AorActInd), them G5128 he G2564 also G2532 called G2564 (AorActInd): and G2532 whom G3739 he called G2564 (AorActInd), them G5128 he G1344 also G2532 justified G1344 (AorActInd): and G1161 whom G3739 he justified G1344 (AorActInd), them G5128 he G1392 also G2532 glorified G1392 (AorActInd).
008:031 What G5101 shall we G2046 then G3767 say G2046 (FutActInd) to G4314 these things G5023? If G1487 God G2316 [be] for G5228 us G2257, who G5101 [can be] against G2596 us G2257?
008:032 He that G3739 G1065 spared G5339 (AorMidDepInd) not G3756 his own G2398 Son G5207, but G0235 delivered G3860 him G0846 up G3860 (AorActInd) for G5228 us G2257 all G3956, how G4459 shall he G5483 not G3780 with G4862 him G0846 also G2532 freely give G5483 (FutMidDepInd) us G2254 all things G3956?
008:033 Who G5101 shall lay any thing G1458 (FutActInd) to the charge G2596 of God’s G2316 elect G1588? [It is] God G2316 that justifieth G1344 (PresActPtc).
008:034 Who G5101 [is] he that condemneth G2632 (PresActPtc/FutActPtc)? [It is] Christ G5547 that died G0599 (Aor2ActPtc), yea G1161 rather G3123 G2532, that is risen again G1453 (AorPasPtc), who G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) even G2532 at G1722 the right hand G1188 of God G2316, who G3739 also G2532 maketh intercession G1793 (PresActInd) for G5228 us G2257.
008:035 Who G5101 shall separate G5563 (FutActInd) us G2248 from G0575 the love G0026 of Christ G5547? [shall] tribulation G2347, or G2228 distress G4730, or G2228 persecution G1375, or G2228 famine G3042, or G2228 nakedness G1132, or G2228 peril G2794, or G2228 sword G3162?
008:036 As G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), G3754 For thy G4675 sake G1752 we are killed G2289 (PresPasInd) all G3650 the day long G2250; we are accounted G3049 (AorPasInd) as G5613 sheep G4263 for the slaughter G4967.
008:037 Nay G0235, in G1722 all G3956 these things G5125 we are more than conquerors G5245 (PresActInd) through G1223 him that loved G0025 (AorActPtc) us G2248.
008:038 For G1063 I am persuaded G3982 (PerfPasInd), that G3754 neither G3777 death G2288, nor G3777 life G2222, nor G3777 angels G0032, nor G3777 principalities G0746, nor G3777 powers G1411, nor G3777 things present G1764 (PerfActPtc), nor G3777 things to come G3195 (PresActPtc),
008:039 Nor G3777 height G5313, nor G3777 depth G0899, nor G3777 any G5100 other G2087 creature G2937, shall be able G1410 (FutMidDepInd) to separate G5563 (AorActInf) us G2248 from G0575 the love G0026 of God G2316, which is in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424 our G2257 Lord G2962.
009:001 ¶  I say G3004 (PresActInd) the truth G0225 in G1722 Christ G5547, I lie G5574 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756, my G3450 conscience G4893 also bearing G4828 me G3427 witness G4828 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151,
009:002 That G3754 I G3427 have G2076 (PresInd) great G3173 heaviness G3077 and G2532 continual G0088 sorrow in G3601 my G3450 heart G2588.
009:003 For G1063 I G1473 could wish G2172 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) that myself G0846 were G1511 (PresInf) accursed G0331 from G0575 Christ G5547 for G5228 my G3450 brethren G0080, my G3450 kinsmen G4773 according G2596 to the flesh G4561:
009:004 Who G3748 are G1526 (PresInd) Israelites G2475; to whom G3739 [pertaineth] the adoption G5206, and G2532 the glory G1391, and G2532 the covenants G1242, and G2532 the giving of the law G3548, and G2532 the service G2999 [of God], and G2532 the promises G1860;
009:005 Whose G3739 [are] the fathers G3962, and G2532 of G1537 whom G3739 as concerning G2596 the flesh G4561 Christ G5547 [came], who G5607 (PresPtc) is over G1909 all G3956, God G2316 blessed G2128 for G1519 ever G0165. Amen G0281.
009:006 Not G3756 as G3634 though G1161 G3754 the word G3056 of God G2316 hath taken none effect G1601 (PerfActInd). For G1063 they [are] not G3756 all G3956 G1537 Israel G2474, which G3588 G3778 are of Israel G2474:
009:007 Neither G3761, because G3754 they are G1526 (PresInd) the seed G4690 of Abraham G0011, [are they] all G3956 children G5043: but G0235, In G1722 Isaac G2464 shall G2564 thy G4671 seed G4690 be called G2564 (FutPasInd).
009:008 That is G5123 (PresInd), They which are the children G5043 of the flesh G4561, these G5023 [are] not G3756 the children G5043 of God G2316: but G0235 the children G5043 of the promise G1860 are counted G3049 (PresMidPasDepInd) for G1519 the seed G4690.
009:009 For G1063 this G3778 [is] the word G3056 of promise G1860, At G2596 this G5126 time G2540 will I come G2064 (FutMidDepInd), and G2532 Sara G4564 shall have G2071 (FutInd) a son G5207.
009:010 And G1161 not G3756 only G3440 [this]; but G0235 when Rebecca G4479 also G2532 had conceived G2845 by G1537 one G1520 G2192 (PresActPtc), [even] by our G2257 father G3962 Isaac G2464;
009:011 (For G1063 [the children] being G1080 not yet G3380 born G1080 (AorPasPtc), neither G3366 having done G4238 (AorActPtc) any G5100 good G0018 or G2228 evil G2556, that G2443 the purpose G4286 of God G2316 according G2596 to election G1589 might stand G3306 (PresActSubj), not G3756 of G1537 works G2041, but G0235 of G1537 him that calleth G2564 (PresActPtc);)
009:012 G3754 It was said G4483 (AorPasInd) unto her G0846, The elder G3187 shall serve G1398 (FutActInd) the younger G1640.
009:013 As G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), Jacob G2384 have I loved G0025 (AorActInd), but G1161 Esau G2269 have I hated G3404 (AorActInd).
009:014 What G5101 shall we say G2046 (FutActInd) then G3767? G3361 [Is there] unrighteousness G0093 with G3844 God G2316? God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt).
009:015 For G1063 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) to Moses G3475, I will have mercy on G1653 (FutActInd) whom G3739 G0302 I will have mercy G1653 (PresActSubj), and G2532 I will have compassion G3627 (FutActInd) on whom G3739 G0302 I will have compassion G3627 (PresActSubj).
009:016 So G0686 then G3767 [it is] not G3756 of him that willeth G2309 (PresActPtc), nor G3761 of him that runneth G5143 (PresActPtc), but G0235 of God G2316 that sheweth mercy G1653 (PresActPtc).
009:017 For G1063 the scripture G1124 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto Pharaoh G5328, Even for G3754 G1519 this G5124 same purpose G0846 have I raised G1825 thee G4571 up G1825 (AorActInd), that G3704 I might shew G1731 (AorMidSubj) my G3450 power G1411 in G1722 thee G4671, and G2532 that G3704 my G3450 name G3686 might be declared G1229 (Aor2PasSubj) throughout G1722 all G3956 the earth G1093.
009:018 Therefore G0686 G3767 hath he mercy G1653 (PresActInd) on whom G3739 he will G2309 (PresActInd) [have mercy], and G1161 whom G3739 he will G2309 (PresActInd) he hardeneth G4645 (PresActInd).
009:019 Thou wilt say G2046 (FutActInd) then G3767 unto me G3427, Why G5101 doth he yet G2089 find fault G3201 (PresMidPasDepInd)? For G1063 who G5101 hath resisted G0436 (PerfActInd) his G0846 will G1013?
009:020 Nay but G3304, O G5599 man G0444, who G5101 art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 that repliest against G0470 (PresMidPasDepPtc) God G2316? G3361 Shall G2046 the thing formed G4110 say G2046 (FutActInd) to him that formed G4111 (AorActPtc) [it], Why G5101 hast thou made G4160 (AorActInd) me G3165 thus G3779?
009:021 G2228 Hath G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 the potter G2763 power G1849 over the clay G4081, of G1537 the same G0846 lump G5445 to G3739 G3303 make G4160 (AorActInf) one vessel G4632 unto G1519 honour G5092, and G1161 another G3739 unto G1519 dishonour G0819?
009:022 [What] if G1487 G1161 God G2316, willing G2309 (PresActPtc) to shew G1731 (AorMidInf) [his] wrath G3709, and G2532 to make G1107 his G0846 power G1415 known G1107 (AorActInf), endured G5342 (AorActInd) with G1722 much G4183 longsuffering G3115 the vessels G4632 of wrath G3709 fitted G2675 (PerfPasPtc) to G1519 destruction G0684:
009:023 And G2532 that G2443 he might make known G1107 (AorActSubj) the riches G4149 of his G0846 glory G1391 on G1909 the vessels G4632 of mercy G1656, which G3739 he had afore prepared G4282 (AorActInd) unto G1519 glory G1391,
009:024 G3739 Even G2532 us G2248, whom G3739 he hath called G2564 (AorActInd), not G3756 of G1537 the Jews G2453 only G3440, but G0235 also G2532 of G1537 the Gentiles G1484?
009:025 As he saith G3004 (PresActInd) also G2532 in G1722 Osee G5617, I will call G2564 (FutActInd) them my G3450 people G2992, which were not G3756 my G3450 people G2992; and G2532 her beloved G0025 (PerfPasPtc), which was G0025 not G3756 beloved G0025 (PerfPasPtc).
009:026 And G2532 it shall come to pass G2071 (FutInd), [that] in G1722 the place G5117 where G3757 G3739 it was said G4483 (AorPasInd) unto them G0846, Ye G5210 [are] not G3756 my G3450 people G2992; there G1563 shall they be called G2564 (FutPasInd) the children G5207 of the living G2198 (PresActPtc) God G2316.
009:027 Esaias G2268 also G1161 crieth G2896 (PresActInd) concerning G5228 Israel G2474, Though G1437 the number G0706 of the children G5207 of Israel G2474 be G5600 (PresSubj) as G5613 the sand G0285 of the sea G2281, a remnant G2640 shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd):
009:028 For G1063 he will finish G4931 (PresActPtc) the work G3056, and G2532 cut [it] short G4932 (PresActPtc) in G1722 righteousness G1343: because G3754 a short G4932 (PerfPasPtc) work G3056 will G4160 the Lord G2962 make G4160 (FutActInd) upon G1909 the earth G1093.
009:029 And G2532 as G2531 Esaias G2268 said before G4280 (PerfActInd), Except G1508 the Lord G2962 of Sabaoth G4519 had left G1459 (Aor2ActInd) us G2254 a seed G4690, we had been G0302 G1096 (AorPasDepInd) as G5613 Sodoma G4670, and G2532 been made like G0302 G3666 (AorPasInd) unto G5613 Gomorrha G1116.
009:030 What G5101 shall we say G2046 (FutActInd) then G3767? That G3754 the Gentiles G1484, which G3588 followed G1377 (PresActPtc) not G3361 after righteousness G1343, have attained G2638 (Aor2ActInd) to righteousness G1343, even G1161 the righteousness G1343 which G3588 is of G1537 faith G4102.
009:031 But G1161 Israel G2474, which followed G1377 (PresActPtc) after the law G3551 of righteousness G1343, hath G5348 not G3756 attained G5348 (AorActInd) to G1519 the law G3551 of righteousness G1343.
009:032 Wherefore G1302? Because G3754 [they sought it] not G3756 by G1537 faith G4102, but G0235 as G5613 it were by G1537 the works G2041 of the law G3551. For G1063 they stumbled G4350 (AorActInd) at that stumblingstone G3037 G4348;
009:033 As G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I lay G5087 (PresActInd) in G1722 Sion G4622 a stumblingstone G3037 G4348 and G2532 rock G4073 of offence G4625: and G2532 whosoever G3956 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1909 him G0846 shall G2617 not G3756 be ashamed G2617 (FutPasInd).
010:001 ¶  Brethren G0080, my G1699 heart’s G2588 desire G2107 and G2532 prayer G1162 to G4314 God G2316 for G5228 Israel G2474 is G2076 (PresInd), that G3303 G1519 they might be saved G4991.
010:002 For G1063 I bear G3140 them G0846 record G3140 (PresActInd) that G3754 they have G2192 (PresActInd) a zeal G2205 of God G2316, but G0235 not G3756 according G2596 to knowledge G1922.
010:003 For G1063 they being ignorant G0050 (PresActPtc) of God’s G2316 righteousness G1343, and G2532 going about G2212 (PresActPtc) to establish G2476 (AorActInf) their own G2398 righteousness G1343, have G5293 not G3756 submitted themselves G5293 (Aor2PasDepSubj) unto the righteousness G1343 of God G2316.
010:004 For G1063 Christ G5547 [is] the end G5056 of the law G3551 for G1519 righteousness G1343 to every one G3956 that believeth G4100 (PresActPtc).
010:005 For G1063 Moses G3475 describeth G1125 (PresActInd) the righteousness G1343 which G3588 is of G1537 the law G3551, That G3754 the man G0444 which doeth G4160 (AorActPtc) those things G0846 shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd) by G1722 them G0846.
010:006 But G1161 the righteousness G1343 which is of G1537 faith G4102 speaketh G3004 (PresActInd) on this wise G3779, Say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) not G3361 in G1722 thine G4675 heart G2588, Who G5101 shall ascend G0305 (FutMidDepInd) into G1519 heaven G3772? (that is G5123 (PresInd), to bring G2609 Christ G5547 down G2609 (Aor2ActInf) [from above]:)
010:007 Or G2228, Who G5101 shall descend G2597 (FutMidDepInd) into G1519 the deep G0012? (that is G5123 (PresInd), to bring up G0321 Christ G5547 again G0321 (Aor2ActInf) from G1537 the dead G3498.)
010:008 But G0235 what G5101 saith it G3004 (PresActInd)? The word G4487 is G2076 (PresInd) nigh G1451 thee G4675, [even] in G1722 thy G4675 mouth G4750, and G2532 in G1722 thy G4675 heart G2588: that is G5123 (PresInd), the word G4487 of faith G4102, which G3739 we preach G2784 (PresActInd);
010:009 That G3754 if G1437 thou shalt confess G3670 (AorActSubj) with G1722 thy G4675 mouth G4750 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424, and G2532 shalt believe G4100 (AorActSubj) in G1722 thine G4675 heart G2588 that G3754 God G2316 hath raised G1453 (AorActInd) him G0846 from G1537 the dead G3498, thou shalt be saved G4982 (FutPasInd).
010:010 For G1063 with the heart G2588 man believeth G4100 (PresPasInd) unto G1519 righteousness G1343; and G1161 with the mouth G4750 confession is made G3670 (PresPasInd) unto G1519 salvation G4991.
010:011 For G1063 the scripture G1124 saith G3004 (PresActInd), Whosoever G3956 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1909 him G0846 shall G2617 not G3756 be ashamed G2617 (FutPasInd).
010:012 For G1063 there is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 difference G1293 between G5037 the Jew G2453 and G2532 the Greek G1672: for G1063 the same G0846 Lord G2962 over all G3956 is rich G4147 (PresActPtc) unto G1519 all G3956 that call upon G1941 (PresMidPtc) him G0846.
010:013 For G3956 G1063 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall call upon G1941 (AorMidSubj) the name G3686 of the Lord G2962 shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd).
010:014 How G4459 then G3767 shall they call on G1941 (FutMidInd) him in G1519 whom G3739 they have G4100 not G3756 believed G4100 (AorActInd)? and G1161 how G4459 shall they believe in G4100 (FutActInd) him of whom G3739 they have G0191 not G3756 heard G0191 (AorActInd)? and G1161 how G4459 shall they hear G0191 (FutActInd) without G5565 a preacher G2784 (PresActPtc)?
010:015 And G1161 how G4459 shall they preach G2784 (FutActInd), except G3362 they be sent G0649 (Aor2PasSubj)? as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), How G5613 beautiful G5611 are the feet of them G4228 that preach the gospel G2097 (PresMidPtc) of peace G1515, and bring glad tidings G2097 (PresMidPtc) of good things G0018!
010:016 But G0235 they have G5219 not G3756 all G3956 obeyed G5219 (AorActInd) the gospel G2098. For G1063 Esaias G2268 saith G3004 (PresActInd), Lord G2962, who G5101 hath believed G4100 (AorActInd) our G2257 report G0189?
010:017 So then G0686 faith G4102 [cometh] by G1537 hearing G0189, and G1161 hearing G0189 by G1223 the word G4487 of God G2316.
010:018 But G0235 I say G3004 (PresActInd), Have G0191 they not G3378 heard G0191 (AorActInd)? Yes verily G3304, their G0846 sound G5353 went G1831 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 all G3956 the earth G1093, and G2532 their G0846 words G4487 unto G1519 the ends G4009 of the world G3625.
010:019 But G0235 I say G3004 (PresActInd), Did G1097 not G3378 Israel G2474 know G1097 (Aor2ActInd)? First G4413 Moses G3475 saith G3004 (PresActInd), I G1473 will provoke G3863 you G5209 to jealousy G3863 (FutActInd) by G1909 [them that are] no G3756 people G1484, [and] by G1909 a foolish G0801 nation G1484 I will anger G3949 (FutActInd) you G5209.
010:020 But G1161 Esaias G2268 is very bold G0662 (PresActInd), and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd), I was found G2147 (AorPasInd) of them that sought G2212 (PresActPtc) me G1691 not G3361; I was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) manifest G1717 unto them that asked G1905 not G3361 after G1905 (PresActPtc) me G1691.
010:021 But G1161 to G4314 Israel G2474 he saith G3004 (PresActInd), All G3650 day long G2250 I have stretched forth G1600 (AorActInd) my G3450 hands G5495 unto G4314 a disobedient G0544 (PresActPtc) and G2532 gainsaying G0483 (PresActPtc) people G2992.
011:001 ¶  I say G3004 (PresActInd) then G3767, G3361 Hath G0683 God G2316 cast away G0683 (AorMidDepInd) his G0846 people G2992? God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt). For G1063 I G1473 also G2532 am G1510 (PresInd) an Israelite G2475, of G1537 the seed G4690 of Abraham G0011, [of] the tribe G5443 of Benjamin G0958.
011:002 God G2316 hath G0683 not G3756 cast away G0683 (AorMidDepInd) his G0846 people G2992 which G3739 he foreknew G4267 (AorActInd). G2228 Wot ye G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 the scripture G1124 saith G3004 (PresActInd) of G1722 Elias G2243? how G5613 he maketh intercession G1793 (PresActInd) to God G2316 against G2596 Israel G2474, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
011:003 Lord G2962, they have killed G0615 (AorActInd) thy G4675 prophets G4396, and G2532 digged down G2679 (AorActInd) thine G4675 altars G2379; and I G2504 am left G5275 (AorPasInd) alone G3441, and G2532 they seek G2212 (PresActInd) my G3450 life G5590.
011:004 But G0235 what G5101 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the answer of God G5538 unto him G0846? I have reserved G2641 (Aor2ActInd) to myself G1683 seven thousand G2035 men G0435, who G3748 have G2578 not G3756 bowed G2578 (AorActInd) the knee G1119 to [the image of] Baal G0896.
011:005 Even so G3779 then G3767 at G1722 this present G3568 time G2540 also G2532 there is G1096 (Perf2ActInd) a remnant G3005 according G2596 to the election G1589 of grace G5485.
011:006 And G1161 if G1487 by grace G5485, then [is it] no more G2089 G3765 of G1537 works G2041: otherwise G1893 grace G5485 is G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) no more G2089 G3765 grace G5485. But G1161 if G1487 [it be] of G1537 works G2041, then is it G2076 (PresInd) no more G2089 G3765 grace G5485: otherwise G1893 work G2041 is G2076 (PresInd) no more G2089 G3765 work G2041.
011:007 What G5101 then G3767? Israel G2474 hath G2013 not G3756 obtained G2013 (Aor2ActInd) that G5127 which G3739 he seeketh for G1934 (PresActInd); but G1161 the election G1589 hath obtained it G2013 (Aor2ActInd), and G1161 the rest G3062 were blinded G4456 (AorPasInd)
011:008 (According as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), God G2316 hath given G1325 (AorActInd) them G0846 the spirit G4151 of slumber G2659, eyes G3788 that they should G0991 not G3361 see G0991 (PresActInf), and G2532 ears G3775 that they should G0191 not G3361 hear G0191 (PresActInf);) unto G2193 this G4594 day G2250.
011:009 And G2532 David G1138 saith G3004 (PresActInd), Let G1096 their G0846 table G5132 be made G1096 (AorPasDepImpr) a snare G1519 G3803, and G2532 a trap G1519 G2339, and G2532 a stumblingblock G1519 G4625, and G2532 a recompence G1519 G0468 unto them G0846:
011:010 Let G4654 their G0846 eyes G3788 be darkened G4654 (AorPasImpr), that they may G0991 not G3361 see G0991 (PresActInf), and G2532 bow down G4781 (AorActImpr) their G0846 back G3577 alway G1275.
011:011 I say G3004 (PresActInd) then G3767, G3361 Have they stumbled G4417 (AorActInd) that G2443 they should fall G4098 (Aor2ActSubj)? God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt): but G0235 [rather] through their G0846 fall G3900 salvation G4991 [is come] unto the Gentiles G1484, for to G1519 provoke G3863 them G0846 to jealousy G3863 (AorActInf).
011:012 Now G1161 if G1487 the fall G3900 of them G0846 [be] the riches G4149 of the world G2889, and G2532 the diminishing G2275 of them G0846 the riches G4149 of the Gentiles G1484; how G4214 much more G3123 their G0846 fulness G4138?
011:013 For G1063 I speak G3004 (PresActInd) to you G5213 Gentiles G1484, inasmuch as G1909 G3745 G3303 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the apostle G0652 of the Gentiles G1484, I magnify G1392 (PresActInd) mine G3450 office G1248:
011:014 If by any means G1513 G4458 I may provoke to emulation G3863 (AorActSubj) [them which are] my G3450 flesh G4561, and G2532 might save G4982 (AorActSubj) some G5100 of G1537 them G0846.
011:015 For G1063 if G1487 the casting away G0580 of them G0846 [be] the reconciling G2643 of the world G2889, what G5101 [shall] the receiving G4356 [of them be], but G1508 life G2222 from G1537 the dead G3498?
011:016 For G1161 if G1487 the firstfruit G0536 [be] holy G0040, the lump G5445 [is] also G2532 [holy]: and G2532 if G1487 the root G4491 [be] holy G0040, so G2532 [are] the branches G2798.
011:017 And G1161 if some G1536 of the branches G2798 be broken off G1575 (AorPasInd), and G1161 thou G4771, being G5607 (PresPtc) a wild olive tree G0065, wert graffed in G1461 (AorPasInd) among G1722 them G0846, and G2532 with G4791 them G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) partakest G4791 of the root G4491 and G2532 fatness G4096 of the olive tree G1636;
011:018 Boast G2620 not G3361 against G2620 (PresMidPasDepImpr) the branches G2798. But G1161 if G1487 thou boast G2620 (PresMidPasDepInd), thou G4771 bearest G0941 (PresActInd) not G3756 the root G4491, but G0235 the root G4491 thee G4571.
011:019 Thou wilt say G2046 (FutActInd) then G3767, The branches G2798 were broken off G1575 (AorPasInd), that G2443 I G1473 might be graffed in G1461 (AorPasSubj).
011:020 Well G2573; because of unbelief G0570 they were broken off G1575 (AorPasInd), and G1161 thou G4771 standest G2476 (PerfActInd) by faith G4102. Be G5309 not G3361 highminded G5309 (PresActImpr), but G0235 fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr):
011:021 For G1063 if G1487 God G2316 spared G5339 (AorMidDepInd) not G3756 the natural G5449 branches G2798 G2596, [take heed] lest G4458 G3381 he G5339 also G3381 spare G5339 (AorMidDepSubj) not G3761 thee G4675.
011:022 Behold G1492 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767 the goodness G5544 and G2532 severity G0663 of God G2316: on G1909 them which fell G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) G3303, severity G0663; but G1161 toward G1909 thee G4571, goodness G5544, if G1437 thou continue G1961 (AorActSubj) in [his] goodness G5544: otherwise G1893 thou G4771 also G2532 shalt be cut off G1581 (Fut2PasInd).
011:023 And G1161 they G1565 also G2532, if G3362 they abide G1961 (AorActSubj) not G3362 still in unbelief G0570, shall be graffed in G1461 (FutPasInd): for G1063 God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) able G1415 to graff G1461 them G0846 in G1461 (AorActInf) again G3825.
011:024 For G1063 if G1487 thou G4771 wert cut G1581 (Aor2PasDepSubj) out of G1537 the olive tree which is wild G0065 by G2596 nature G5449, and G2532 wert graffed G1461 (AorPasInd) contrary to G3844 nature G5449 into G1519 a good olive tree G2565: how much G4214 more G3123 shall these G3778, which be the natural G2596 G5449 [branches], be graffed into G1461 (FutPasInd) their own G2398 olive tree G1636?
011:025 For G1063 I would G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756, brethren G0080, that ye G5209 should be ignorant G0050 (PresActInf) of this G5124 mystery G3466, lest G3363 ye should be G5600 (PresSubj) wise G5429 in G3844 your own conceits G1438; that G3754 blindness G4457 in G0575 part G3313 is happened G1096 (Perf2ActInd) to Israel G2474, until G0891 G3739 the fulness G4138 of the Gentiles G1484 be come in G1525 (Aor2ActSubj).
011:026 And G2532 so G3779 all G3956 Israel G2474 shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd): as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), There shall come G2240 (FutActInd) out of G1537 Sion G4622 the Deliverer G4506 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 shall turn away G0654 (FutActInd) ungodliness G0763 from G0575 Jacob G2384:
011:027 For G2532 this G3778 [is] my G3844 G1700 covenant G1242 unto them G0846, when G3752 I shall take away G0851 (Aor2MidSubj) their G0846 sins G0266.
011:028 As concerning G2596 G3303 the gospel G2098, [they are] enemies G2190 for your sakes G1223 G5209: but G1161 as touching G2596 the election G1589, [they are] beloved G0027 for G1223 the fathers G3962 ’ sakes G1223.
011:029 For G1063 the gifts G5486 and G2532 calling G2821 of God G2316 [are] without repentance G0278.
011:030 For G1063 as G5618 G2532 ye G5210 in times past G4218 have not believed G0544 (AorActInd) God G2316, yet G1161 have G1653 now G3568 obtained mercy G1653 (AorPasInd) through G5130 their unbelief G0543:
011:031 Even so G3779 have G0544 these G3778 also G2532 now G3568 not believed G0544 (AorActInd), that G2443 through your G5212 mercy G1656 they G0846 also G2532 may obtain mercy G1653 (AorPasSubj).
011:032 For G1063 God G2316 hath concluded G4788 (AorActInd) them all G3956 in G1519 unbelief G0543, that G2443 he might have mercy G1653 (AorActSubj) upon all G3956.
011:033 O G5599 the depth G0899 of the riches G4149 both G2532 of the wisdom G4678 and G2532 knowledge G1108 of God G2316! how G5613 unsearchable G0419 [are] his G0846 judgments G2917, and G2532 his G0846 ways G3598 past finding out G0421!
011:034 For G1063 who G5101 hath known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) the mind G3563 of the Lord G2962? or G2228 who G5101 hath been G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) his G0846 counsellor G4825?
011:035 Or G2228 who G5101 hath first given G4272 (AorActInd) to him G0846, and G2532 it shall be recompensed G0467 unto him G0846 again G0467 (FutPasInd)?
011:036 For G3754 of G1537 him G0846, and G2532 through G1223 him G0846, and G2532 to G1519 him G0846, [are] all things G3956: to whom G0846 [be] glory G1391 for G1519 ever G0165. Amen G0281.
012:001 ¶  I beseech G3870 (PresActInd) you G5209 therefore G3767, brethren G0080, by G1223 the mercies G3628 of God G2316, that ye present G3936 (AorActInf) your G5216 bodies G4983 a living G2198 (PresActPtc) sacrifice G2378, holy G0040, acceptable G2101 unto God G2316, [which is] your G5216 reasonable G3050 service G2999.
012:002 And G2532 be G4964 not G3361 conformed G4964 (PresMidPasImpr) to this G5129 world G0165: but G0235 be ye transformed G3339 (PresPasImpr) by the renewing G0342 of your G5216 mind G3563, that G1519 ye G5209 may prove G1381 (PresActInf) what G5101 [is] that good G0018, and G2532 acceptable G2101, and G2532 perfect G5046, will G2307 of God G2316.
012:003 For G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd), through G1223 the grace G5485 given G1325 (AorPasPtc) unto me G3427, to every man G3956 that is G5607 (PresPtc) among G1722 you G5213, not G3361 to think [of himself] more G3844 highly G5252 (PresActInf) than G3739 he ought G1163 (PresInd) to think G5426 (PresActInf); but G0235 to think G5426 (PresActInf) soberly G1519 G4993 (PresActInf), according as G5613 God G2316 hath dealt G3307 (AorActInd) to every man G1538 the measure G3358 of faith G4102.
012:004 For G1063 as G2509 we have G2192 (PresActInd) many G4183 members G3196 in G1722 one G1520 body G4983, and G1161 all G3956 members G3196 have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 the same G0846 office G4234:
012:005 So G3779 we G2070, [being] many G4183, are G2070 (PresInd) one G1520 body G4983 in G1722 Christ G5547, and G1161 every G2596 one G1520 members G3196 one of another G0240.
012:006 Having G2192 (PresActPtc) then G1161 gifts G5486 differing G1313 according G2596 to the grace G5485 that is given G1325 (AorPasPtc) to us G2254, whether G1535 prophecy G4394, [let us prophesy] according G2596 to the proportion G0356 of faith G4102;
012:007 Or G1535 ministry G1248, [let us wait] on G1722 [our] ministering G1248: or G1535 he that teacheth G1321 (PresActPtc), on G1722 teaching G1319;
012:008 Or G1535 he that exhorteth G3870 (PresActPtc), on G1722 exhortation G3874: he that giveth G3330 (PresActPtc), [let him do it] with G1722 simplicity G0572; he that ruleth G4291 (PresMidPtc), with G1722 diligence G4710; he that sheweth mercy G1653 (PresActPtc), with G1722 cheerfulness G2432.
012:009 [Let] love G0026 (PresSubj) be without dissimulation G0505. Abhor G0655 (PresActPtc) that which is evil G4190; cleave G2853 (PresPasPtc) to that which is good G0018.
012:010 [Be] kindly affectioned G5387 one to another G1519 G0240 with brotherly love G5360; in honour G5092 preferring G4285 (PresMidPasDepPtc) one another G0240;
012:011 Not G3361 slothful G3636 in business G4710; fervent G2204 (PresActPtc) in spirit G4151; serving G1398 (PresActPtc) the Lord G2962;
012:012 Rejoicing G5463 (PresActPtc) in hope G1680; patient G5278 (PresActPtc) in tribulation G2347; continuing instant G4342 (PresActPtc) in prayer G4335;
012:013 Distributing G2841 (PresActPtc) to the necessity G5532 of saints G0040; given G1377 (PresActPtc) to hospitality G5381.
012:014 Bless G2127 (PresActImpr) them which persecute G1377 (PresActPtc) you G5209: bless G2127 (PresActImpr), and G2532 curse G2672 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361.
012:015 Rejoice G5463 (PresActInf) with G3326 them that do rejoice G5463 (PresActPtc), and G2532 weep G2799 (PresActInf) with G3326 them that weep G2799 (PresActPtc).
012:016 [Be] of the same G0846 mind G5426 (PresActPtc) one toward another G1519 G0240. Mind G5426 (PresActPtc) not G3361 high things G5308, but G0235 condescend G4879 (PresMidPtc) to men of low estate G5011. Be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361 wise G5429 in G3844 your own conceits G1438.
012:017 Recompense G0591 (PresActPtc) to no man G3367 evil G2556 for G0473 evil G2556. Provide G4306 (PresMidPtc) things honest G2570 in the sight G1799 of all G3956 men G0444.
012:018 If G1487 it be possible G1415, as much as lieth in G1537 you G5216, live peaceably G1514 (PresActPtc) with G3326 all G3956 men G0444.
012:019 Dearly beloved G0027, avenge G1556 (PresActPtc) not G3361 yourselves G1438, but G0235 [rather] give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) place G5117 unto wrath G3709: for G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), Vengeance G1557 [is] mine G1698; I G1473 will repay G0467 (FutActInd), saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Lord G2962.
012:020 Therefore G3767 if G1437 thine G4675 enemy G2190 hunger G3983 (PresActSubj), feed G5595 (PresActImpr) him G0846; if G1437 he thirst G1372 (PresActSubj), give G4222 him G0846 drink G4222 (PresActImpr): for G1063 in so G5124 doing G4160 (PresActPtc) thou shalt heap G4987 (FutActInd) coals G0440 of fire G4442 on G1909 his G0846 head G2776.
012:021 Be G3528 not G3361 overcome G3528 (PresPasImpr) of G5259 evil G2556, but G0235 overcome G3528 (PresActImpr) evil G2556 with G1722 good G0018.
013:001 ¶  Let every G3956 soul G5590 be subject G5293 (PresMidImpr) unto the higher G5242 (PresActPtc) powers G1849. For G1063 there is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 power G1849 but G1508 of G0575 God G2316: G1161 the powers G1849 that be G5607 (PresPtc) are G1526 (PresInd) ordained G5021 (PerfPasPtc) of G5259 God G2316.
013:002 Whosoever therefore G5620 resisteth G0498 (PresMidPtc) the power G1849, resisteth G0436 (PerfActInd) the ordinance G1296 of God G2316: and G1161 they that resist G0436 (PerfActPtc) shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) to themselves G1438 damnation G2917.
013:003 For G1063 rulers G0758 are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756 a terror G5401 to good G0018 works G2041, but G0235 to the evil G2556. Wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd) then G1161 not G3361 be afraid G5399 (PresMidPasDepInf) of the power G1849? do G4160 (PresActImpr) that which is good G0018, and G2532 thou shalt have G2192 (FutActInd) praise G1868 of G1537 the same G0846:
013:004 For G1063 he is G2076 (PresInd) the minister G1249 of God G2316 to thee G4671 for G1519 good G0018. But G1161 if G1437 thou do G4160 (PresActSubj) that which is evil G2556, be afraid G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr); for G1063 he beareth G5409 (PresActInd) not G3756 the sword G3162 in vain G1500: for G1063 he is G2076 (PresInd) the minister G1249 of God G2316, a revenger G1558 to [execute] wrath G3709 upon G1519 him that doeth G4238 (PresActPtc) evil G2556.
013:005 Wherefore G1352 [ye] must needs G0318 be subject G5293 (PresMidInf), not G3756 only G3440 for G1223 wrath G3709, but G0235 also G2532 for conscience G4893 sake G1223.
013:006 For G1063 for G1223 this G5124 cause G1223 pay ye G5055 (PresActInd) tribute G5411 also G2532: for G1063 they are G1526 (PresInd) God’s G2316 ministers G3011, attending continually G4342 (PresActPtc) upon G1519 this G5124 very thing G0846.
013:007 Render G0591 (Aor2ActImpr) therefore G3767 to all G3956 their dues G3782: tribute G5411 to whom G3588 tribute G5411 [is due]; custom G5056 to whom G3588 custom G5056; fear G5401 to whom G3588 fear G5401; honour G5092 to whom G3588 honour G5092.
013:008 Owe G3784 (PresActImpr) no man G3367 any thing G3367, but G1508 to love G0025 (PresActInf) one another G0240: for G1063 he that loveth G0025 (PresActPtc) another G2087 hath fulfilled G4137 (PerfActInd) the law G3551.
013:009 For G1063 this, Thou shalt G3431 not G3756 commit adultery G3431 (FutActInd), Thou shalt G5407 not G3756 kill G5407 (FutActInd), Thou shalt G2813 not G3756 steal G2813 (FutActInd), Thou shalt G5576 not G3756 bear false witness G5576 (FutActInd), Thou shalt G1937 not G3756 covet G1937 (FutActInd); and G2532 if [there be] any G1536 other G2087 commandment G1785, it is briefly comprehended G0346 (PresPasInd) in G1722 this G5129 saying G3056, namely G1722, Thou shalt love G0025 (FutActInd) thy G4675 neighbour G4139 as G5613 thyself G1438.
013:010 Love G0026 worketh G2038 (PresMidPasDepInd) no G3756 ill G2556 to his neighbour G4139: therefore G3767 love G0026 [is] the fulfilling G4138 of the law G3551.
013:011 And G2532 that G5124, knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) the time G2540, that G3754 now G2235 [it is] high time G5610 to awake G2248 G1453 (AorPasInf) out of G1537 sleep G5258: for G1063 now G3568 [is] our G2257 salvation G4991 nearer G1452 than G2228 when G3753 we believed G4100 (AorActInd).
013:012 The night G3571 is far spent G4298 (AorActInd), G1161 the day G2250 is at hand G1448 (PerfActInd): let us G0659 therefore G3767 cast off G0659 (Aor2MidSubj) the works G2041 of darkness G4655, and G2532 let us put on G1746 (AorMidSubj) the armour G3696 of light G5457.
013:013 Let us walk G4043 (AorActSubj) honestly G2156, as G5613 in G1722 the day G2250; not G3361 in rioting G2970 and G2532 drunkenness G3178, not G3361 in chambering G2845 and G2532 wantonness G0766, not G3361 in strife G2054 and G2532 envying G2205.
013:014 But G0235 put ye on G1746 (AorMidImpr) the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, and G2532 make G4160 (PresMidImpr) not G3361 provision G4307 for G1519 the flesh G4561, to [fulfil] the lusts G1939 [thereof].
014:001 ¶  Him that is weak G0770 (PresActPtc) in the faith G4102 receive ye G4355 (PresMidImpr), [but] G1161 not G3361 to G1519 doubtful G1261 disputations G1253.
014:002 For G3303 one G3739 believeth G4100 (PresActInd) that he may eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) all things G3956: another G1161, who is weak G0770 (PresActPtc), eateth G2068 (PresActInd) herbs G3001.
014:003 Let G1848 not G3361 him that eateth G2068 (PresActPtc) despise G1848 (PresActImpr) him that eateth G2068 (PresActPtc) not G3361; and G2532 let G2068 not G3361 him which eateth G2068 (PresActPtc) not G3361 judge G2919 (PresActImpr) him that eateth G2068 (PresActPtc): for G1063 God G2316 hath received G4355 (Aor2MidInd) him G0846.
014:004 Who G5101 art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 that judgest G2919 (PresActPtc) another man’s G0245 servant G3610? to his own G2398 master G2962 he standeth G4739 (PresActInd) or G2228 falleth G4098 (PresActInd). Yea G1161, he shall be holden up G2476 (FutPasInd): for G1063 God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) able G1415 to make G2476 him G0846 stand G2476 (AorActInf).
014:005 One G3303 man G3739 esteemeth G2919 (PresActInd) one day G2250 above G3844 another G2250: G1161 another G3739 esteemeth G2919 (PresActInd) every G3956 day G2250 [alike]. Let G4135 every man G1538 be fully persuaded G4135 (PresPasImpr) in G1722 his own G2398 mind G3563.
014:006 He that regardeth G5426 (PresActPtc) the day G2250, regardeth G5426 (PresActInd) [it] unto the Lord G2962; and G2532 he that regardeth G5426 (PresActPtc) not G3361 the day G2250, to the Lord G2962 he doth G5426 not G3756 regard G5426 (PresActInd) [it]. He that eateth G2068 (PresActPtc), eateth G2068 (PresActInd) to the Lord G2962, for G1063 he giveth God G2316 thanks G2168 (PresActInd); and G2532 he that eateth G2068 (PresActPtc) not G3361, to the Lord G2962 he eateth G2068 (PresActInd) not G3756, and G2532 giveth God G2316 thanks G2168 (PresActInd).
014:007 For G1063 none G3762 of us G2257 liveth G2198 (PresActInd) to himself G1438, and G2532 no man G3762 dieth G0599 (PresActInd) to himself G1438.
014:008 For G1063 whether G1437 G5037 we live G2198 (PresActSubj), we live G2198 (PresActInd) unto the Lord G2962; and whether G1437 G5037 we die G0599 (PresActSubj), we die G0599 (PresActInd) unto the Lord G2962: whether G1437 G5037 we live G2198 (PresActSubj) therefore G3767, or G1437 G5037 die G0599 (PresActSubj), we are G2070 (PresInd) the Lord’s G2962.
014:009 For G1063 to G1519 this G5124 end Christ G5547 both G2532 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 rose G0450 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 revived G0326 (AorActInd), that G2443 he might be Lord G2961 (AorActSubj) both G2532 of the dead G3498 and G2532 living G2198 (PresActPtc).
014:010 But G1161 why G5101 dost G2919 thou G4771 judge G2919 (PresActInd) thy G4675 brother G0080? or G2228 G2532 why G5101 dost G1848 thou G4771 set at nought G1848 (PresActInd) thy G4675 brother G0080? for G1063 we shall G3936 all G3956 stand before G3936 (FutMidDepInd) the judgment seat G0968 of Christ G5547.
014:011 For G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), [As] I G1473 live G2198 (PresActInd), saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Lord G2962, G3754 every G3956 knee G1119 shall bow G2578 (FutActInd) to me G1698, and G2532 every G3956 tongue G1100 shall confess G1843 (FutMidInd) to God G2316.
014:012 So G3767 then G0686 every one G1538 of us G2257 shall give G1325 (FutActInd) account G3056 of G4012 himself G1438 to God G2316.
014:013 Let us G2919 not therefore G3767 judge G2919 (PresActSubj) one another G0240 any more G3371: but G0235 judge G2919 (AorActImpr) this G5124 rather G3123, that no man G3361 put G5087 (PresActInf) a stumblingblock G4348 or G2228 an occasion to fall G4625 in [his] brother’s way G0080.
014:014 I know G1492 (PerfActInd), and G2532 am persuaded G3982 (PerfPasInd) by G1722 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424, that G3754 [there is] nothing G3762 unclean G2839 of G1223 itself G1438: but G1508 to him that esteemeth G3049 (PresMidPasDepPtc) any thing G5100 to be G1511 (PresInf) unclean G2839, to him G1565 [it is] unclean G2839.
014:015 But G1161 if G1487 thy G4675 brother G0080 be grieved G3076 (PresPasInd) with G1223 [thy] meat G1033, now G3765 walkest thou G4043 (PresActInd) not G3765 charitably G0026 G2596. Destroy G0622 (PresActImpr) not G3361 him G1565 with thy G4675 meat G1033, for G5228 whom G3739 Christ G5547 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd).
014:016 Let G0987 not G3361 then G3767 your G5216 good G0018 be evil spoken of G0987 (PresPasImpr):
014:017 For G1063 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 meat G1035 and G2532 drink G4213; but G0235 righteousness G1343, and G2532 peace G1515, and G2532 joy G5479 in G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
014:018 For G1063 he that in G1722 these things G5125 serveth G1398 (PresActPtc) Christ G5547 [is] acceptable G2101 to God G2316, and G2532 approved G1384 of men G0444.
014:019 Let us G1377 therefore G0686 G3767 follow after G1377 (PresActSubj) the things which make for G3588 peace G1515, and G2532 things wherewith G1519 one G0240 may edify G3619 another G0240.
014:020 For G1752 meat G1033 destroy G2647 (PresActImpr) not G3361 the work G2041 of God G2316. All things G3956 indeed G3303 [are] pure G2513; but G0235 [it is] evil G2556 for that man G0444 who eateth G2068 (PresActPtc) with G1223 offence G4348.
014:021 [It is] good G2570 neither G3361 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) flesh G2907, nor G3366 to drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf) wine G3631, nor G3366 [any thing] whereby G1722 G3739 thy G4675 brother G0080 stumbleth G4350 (PresActInd), or G2228 is offended G4624 (PresPasInd), or G2228 is made weak G0770 (PresActInd).
014:022 Hast G2192 (PresActInd) thou G4771 faith G4102? have G2192 (PresActImpr) [it] to G2596 thyself G4572 before G1799 God G2316. Happy G3107 [is] he that condemneth G2919 (PresActPtc) not G3361 himself G1438 in G1722 that thing which G3739 he alloweth G1381 (PresActInd).
014:023 And G1161 he that doubteth G1252 (PresMidPtc) is damned G2632 (PerfPasInd) if G1437 he eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj), because G3754 [he eateth] not G3756 of G1537 faith G4102: for G1161 whatsoever G3739 G3956 [is] not G3756 of G1537 faith G4102 is G2076 (PresInd) sin G0266.
015:001 ¶  We G2249 then G1161 that are strong G1415 ought G3784 (PresActInd) to bear G0941 (PresActInf) the infirmities G0771 of the weak G0102, and G2532 not G3361 to please G0700 (PresActInf) ourselves G1438.
015:002 G1063 Let G0700 every one G1538 of us G2257 please G0700 (PresActImpr) [his] neighbour G4139 for G1519 [his] good G0018 to G4314 edification G3619.
015:003 For G1063 even G2532 Christ G5547 pleased G0700 (AorActInd) not G3756 himself G1438; but G0235, as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), The reproaches G3680 of them that reproached G3679 (PresActPtc) thee G4571 fell G1968 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 me G1691.
015:004 For G1063 whatsoever things G3745 were written aforetime G4270 (Aor2PasDepSubj) were written G4270 (Aor2PasDepSubj) for G1519 our G2251 learning G1319, that G2443 we G2192 through G1223 patience G5281 and G2532 comfort G3874 of the scriptures G1124 might have G2192 (PresActSubj) hope G1680.
015:005 Now G1161 the God G2316 of patience G5281 and G2532 consolation G3874 grant G1325 (Aor2ActOpt) you G5213 to be G0846 likeminded G5426 (PresActInf) one G0240 toward another G1722 G0240 according G2596 to Christ G5547 Jesus G2424:
015:006 That G2443 ye may G1392 with one mind G3661 [and] G1722 one G1520 mouth G4750 glorify G1392 (PresActSubj) God G2316, even G2532 the Father G3962 of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
015:007 Wherefore G1352 receive ye G4355 (PresMidImpr) one another G0240, as G2531 G2532 Christ G5547 also G2531 received G4355 (Aor2MidInd) us G2248 to G1519 the glory G1391 of God G2316.
015:008 Now G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) that Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 was G1096 (PerfPasInf) a minister G1249 of the circumcision G4061 for G5228 the truth G0225 of God G2316, to G1519 confirm G0950 (AorActInf) the promises G1860 [made] unto the fathers G3962:
015:009 And G1161 that the Gentiles G1484 might glorify G1392 (AorActInf) God G2316 for G5228 [his] mercy G1656; as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), For G1223 this G5124 cause G1223 I will confess G1843 (FutMidInd) to thee G4671 among G1722 the Gentiles G1484, and G2532 sing G5567 (FutActInd) unto thy G4675 name G3686.
015:010 And G2532 again G3825 he saith G3004 (PresActInd), Rejoice, ye G2165 (AorPasImpr) Gentiles G1484, with G3326 his G0846 people G2992.
015:011 And G2532 again G3825, Praise G0134 the Lord G2962, all G3956 ye G0134 (PresActImpr) Gentiles G1484; and G2532 laud G1867 (AorActImpr) him G0846, all ye G3956 people G2992.
015:012 And G2532 again G3825, Esaias G2268 saith G3004 (PresActInd), There shall be G2071 (FutInd) a root G4491 of Jesse G2421, and G2532 he that shall rise G0450 (PresMidPtc) to reign over G0757 (PresActInf) the Gentiles G1484; in G1909 him G0846 shall G1679 the Gentiles G1484 trust G1679 (FutActInd).
015:013 Now G1161 the God G2316 of hope G1680 fill G4137 (AorActOpt) you G5209 with all G3956 joy G5479 and G2532 peace G1515 in G1722 believing G4100 (PresActInf), that G1519 ye G5209 may abound G4052 (PresActInf) in G1722 hope G1680, through G1722 the power G1411 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
015:014 And G1161 I G1473 myself G0846 also G2532 am persuaded G3982 (PerfPasInd) of G4012 you G5216, my G3450 brethren G0080, that G3754 ye G0846 also G2532 are G2075 (PresInd) full G3324 of goodness G0019, filled G4137 (PerfPasPtc) with all G3956 knowledge G1108, able G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) also G2532 to admonish G3560 (PresActInf) one another G0240.
015:015 Nevertheless G1161, brethren G0080, I have written G1125 (AorActInd) the more boldly G5112 unto you G5213 in G0575 some sort G3313, as G5613 putting G1878 you G5209 in mind G1878 (PresActPtc), because G1223 of the grace G5485 that is given G1325 (AorPasPtc) to me G3427 of G5259 God G2316,
015:016 That I G3165 should be G1519 G1511 (PresInf) the minister G3011 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 to G1519 the Gentiles G1484, ministering G2418 (PresActPtc) the gospel G2098 of God G2316, that G2443 the offering up G4376 of the Gentiles G1484 might be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) acceptable G2144, being sanctified G0037 (PerfPasPtc) by G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
015:017 I have G2192 (PresActInd) therefore whereof G3767 I may glory G2746 through G1722 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 in those things which pertain to G4314 God G2316.
015:018 For G1063 I will G5111 not G3756 dare G5111 (FutActInd) to speak G2980 (PresActInf) of any G5100 of those things which G3739 Christ G5547 hath G2716 not G3756 wrought G2716 (AorMidDepInd) by G1223 me G1700, to make G1519 the Gentiles G1484 obedient G5218, by word G3056 and G2532 deed G2041,
015:019 Through G1722 mighty G1411 signs G4592 and G2532 wonders G5059, by G1722 the power G1411 of the Spirit G4151 of God G2316; so G5620 that from G0575 Jerusalem G2419, and G2532 round about G2945 unto G3360 Illyricum G2437, I G3165 have fully preached G4137 (PerfActInf) the gospel G2098 of Christ G5547.
015:020 Yea G1161, so G3779 have I strived G5389 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to preach the gospel G2097 (PresMidInf), not G3756 where G3699 Christ G5547 was named G3687 (AorPasInd), lest G3363 I should build G3618 (PresActSubj) upon G1909 another man’s G0245 foundation G2310:
015:021 But G0235 as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), To whom G3739 he G0846 was G0312 not G3756 spoken G0312 (Aor2PasDepSubj) of G4012, they shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd): and G2532 they G3739 that have G0191 not G3756 heard G0191 (Perf2ActInd) shall understand G4920 (FutInd).
015:022 For which cause G1352 also G2532 I have been G1465 much G4183 hindered G1465 (ImpfPasInd) from coming G2064 (Aor2ActInf) to G4314 you G5209.
015:023 But G1161 now G3570 having G2192 (PresActPtc) no more G3371 place G5117 in G1722 these G0575 G5125 parts G2824, and G1161 having G2192 (PresActPtc) a great desire G1974 these many G4183 years G2094 to come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) unto G4314 you G5209;
015:024 Whensoever G5613 G1437 I take my journey G4198 (PresMidPasDepSubj) into G1519 Spain G4681, I will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) to G4314 you G5209: for G1063 I trust G1679 (PresActInd) to see G2300 (AorMidDepInf) you G5209 in my journey G1279 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 to be brought on my way G4311 (AorPasInf) thitherward G1563 by G5259 you G5216, if G1437 first G4412 I be G1705 somewhat G3313 filled G1705 (AorPasSubj) with G0575 your G5216 [company].
015:025 But G1161 now G3570 I go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G1519 Jerusalem G2419 to minister G1247 (PresActPtc) unto the saints G0040.
015:026 For G1063 it hath pleased them G2106 (AorActInd) of Macedonia G3109 and G2532 Achaia G0882 to make G4160 (AorMidInf) a certain G5100 contribution G2842 for G1519 the poor G4434 saints G0040 which G3588 are at G1722 Jerusalem G2419.
015:027 It hath pleased them G2106 (AorActInd) verily G1063; and G2532 their G0846 debtors G3781 they are G1526 (PresInd). For G1063 if G1487 the Gentiles G1484 have been made partakers G2841 (AorActInd) of their G0846 spiritual things G4152, their duty is G3784 (PresActInd) also G2532 to minister G3008 (AorActInf) unto them G0846 in G1722 carnal things G4559.
015:028 When therefore G3767 I have performed G2005 (AorActPtc) this G5124, and G2532 have sealed G4972 (AorMidPtc) to them G0846 this G5126 fruit G2590, I will come G0565 (FutMidDepInd) by G1223 you G5216 into G1519 Spain G4681.
015:029 And G1161 I am sure G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754, when I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) unto G4314 you G5209, I shall come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) in G1722 the fulness G4138 of the blessing G2129 of the gospel G2098 of Christ G5547.
015:030 Now G1161 I beseech G3870 (PresActInd) you G5209, brethren G0080, for G1223 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ’s G5547 sake G2257, and G2532 for G1223 the love G0026 of the Spirit G4151, that ye strive together G4865 (AorMidDepInf) with me G3427 in G1722 [your] prayers G4335 to G4314 God G2316 for G5228 me G1700;
015:031 That G2443 I may be delivered G4506 (AorPasSubj) from G0575 them that do not believe G0544 (PresActPtc) in G1722 Judaea G2449; and G2532 that G2443 my G3450 service G1248 which G3588 [I have] for G1519 Jerusalem G2419 may be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) accepted G2144 of the saints G0040;
015:032 That G2443 I may come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) unto G4314 you G5209 with G1722 joy G5479 by G1223 the will G2307 of God G2316, and G2532 may G4875 with you G5213 be refreshed G4875 (AorMidDepSubj).
015:033 Now G1161 the God G2316 of peace G1515 [be] with G3326 you G5216 all G3956. Amen G0281.
016:001 ¶  G1161 I commend G4921 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 Phebe G5402 our G2257 sister G0079, which is G5607 (PresPtc) a servant G1249 of the church G1577 which G3588 is at G1722 Cenchrea G2747:

016:003 Greet G0782 (AorMidDepImpr) Priscilla G4252 and G2532 Aquila G0207 my G3450 helpers G4904 in G1722 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424:

016:005 Likewise G2532 [greet] the church G1577 that is in G2596 their G0846 house G3624. Salute G0782 (AorMidDepImpr) my G3450 wellbeloved G0027 Epaenetus G1866, who G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) the firstfruits G0536 of Achaia G0882 unto G1519 Christ G5547.

016:017 Now G1161 I beseech G3870 (PresActInd) you G5209, brethren G0080, mark G4648 (PresActInf) them which cause G4160 (PresActPtc) divisions G1370 and G2532 offences G4625 contrary G3844 to the doctrine G1322 which G3739 ye G5210 have learned G3129 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 avoid G1578 (AorActImpr) them G0575 G0846.
016:018 For G1063 they that are such G5108 serve G1398 (PresActInd) not G3756 our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, but G0235 their own G1438 belly G2836; and G2532 by G1223 good words G5542 and G2532 fair speeches G2129 deceive G1818 (PresActInd) the hearts G2588 of the simple G0172.
016:019 For G1063 your G5216 obedience G5218 is come abroad G0864 (Aor2MidDepInd) unto G1519 all G3956 [men]. I am glad G5463 (PresActInd) therefore G3767 on G1909 your G5213 behalf G1909: but yet G1161 I would have G2309 (PresActInd) you G5209 wise G4680 unto G1519 that which is G1511 (PresInf) good G3303 G0018, and G1161 simple G0185 concerning G1519 evil G2556.
016:020 And G1161 the God G2316 of peace G1515 shall bruise G4937 (FutActInd) Satan G4567 under G5259 your G5216 feet G4228 shortly G1722 G5034. The grace G5485 of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 [be] with G3326 you G5216. Amen G0281.

016:025 Now G1161 to him that is of power G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to stablish G4741 (AorActInf) you G5209 according G2596 to my G3450 gospel G2098, and G2532 the preaching G2782 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, according G2596 to the revelation G0602 of the mystery G3466, which was kept secret G4601 (PerfPasPtc) since the world began G5550 G0166,
016:026 But G1161 now G3568 is made manifest G5319 (AorPasPtc), and G5037 by G1223 the scriptures G1124 of the prophets G4397, according G2596 to the commandment G2003 of the everlasting G0166 God G2316, made known G1107 (AorPasPtc) to G1519 all G3956 nations G1484 for G1519 the obedience G5218 of faith G4102:
016:027 To God G2316 only G3441 wise G4680, [be] glory G1391 through G1223 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 for G1519 ever G0165. Amen G0281. «[Written G1125 (Aor2PasDepSubj) to G4314 the Romans G4514 from G0575 Corinthus G2882, [and sent] by G1223 Phebe G5402 servant G1249 of the church G1577 at G1722 Cenchrea G2747.]»
