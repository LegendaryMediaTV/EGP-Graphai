001:001 ¶  The words H1697 of Jeremiah H3414 the son H1121 of Hilkiah H2518, of the priests H3548 that [were] in Anathoth H6068 in the land H0776 of Benjamin H1144:
001:002 To whom the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came in the days H3117 of Josiah H2977 the son H1121 of Amon H0526 king H4428 of Judah H3063, in the thirteenth H7969 H6240 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800).
001:003 It came also in the days H3117 of Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063, unto the end H8552 (8800) of the eleventh H6249 H6240 year H8141 of Zedekiah H6667 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063, unto the carrying away H1540 of Jerusalem H3389 captive H1540 (8800) in the fifth H2549 month H2320.
001:004 Then the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
001:005 Before H2962 I formed H3335 (8799) thee in the belly H0990 I knew H3045 (8804) thee; and before thou camest forth H3318 (8799) out of the womb H7358 I sanctified H6942 (8689) thee, [and] I ordained H5414 (8804) thee a prophet H5030 unto the nations H1471.
001:006 Then said H0559 (8799) I, Ah H0162, Lord H0136 GOD H3069! behold, I cannot H3045 (8804) speak H1696 (8763): for I [am] a child H5288.
001:007 But the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Say H0559 (8799) not, I [am] a child H5288: for thou shalt go H3212 (8799) to all that I shall send H7971 (8799) thee, and whatsoever I command H6680 (8762) thee thou shalt speak H1696 (8762).
001:008 Be not afraid H3372 (8799) of their faces H6440: for I [am] with thee to deliver H5337 (8687) thee, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
001:009 Then the LORD H3068 put forth H7971 (8799) his hand H3027, and touched H5060 (8686) my mouth H6310. And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Behold, I have put H5414 (8804) my words H1697 in thy mouth H6310.
001:010 See H7200 (8798), I have this day H3117 set H6485 (8689) thee over the nations H1471 and over the kingdoms H4467, to root out H5428 (8800), and to pull down H5422 (8800), and to destroy H0006 (8687), and to throw down H2040 (8800), to build H1129 (8800), and to plant H5193 (8800).
001:011 Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800), Jeremiah H3414, what seest H7200 (8802) thou? And I said H0559 (8799), I see H7200 (8802) a rod H4731 of an almond tree H8247.
001:012 Then said H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068 unto me, Thou hast well H3190 (8689) seen H7200 (8800): for I will hasten H8245 (8802) my word H1697 to perform H6213 (8800) it.
001:013 And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me the second time H8145, saying H0559 (8800), What seest H7200 (8802) thou? And I said H0559 (8799), I see H7200 (8802) a seething H5301 (8803) pot H5518; and the face H6440 thereof [is] toward H6440 the north H6828.
001:014 Then the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Out of the north H6828 an evil H7451 shall break forth H6605 (8735) upon all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776.
001:015 For, lo, I will call H7121 (8802) all the families H4940 of the kingdoms H4467 of the north H6828, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; and they shall come H0935 (8804), and they shall set H5414 (8804) every one H0376 his throne H3678 at the entering H6607 of the gates H8179 of Jerusalem H3389, and against all the walls H2346 thereof round about H5439, and against all the cities H5892 of Judah H3063.
001:016 And I will utter H1696 (8765) my judgments H4941 against them touching H5921 all their wickedness H7451, who have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and have burned incense H6999 (8762) unto other H0312 gods H0430, and worshipped H7812 (8691) the works H4639 of their own hands H3027.
001:017 Thou therefore gird up H0247 (8799) thy loins H4975, and arise H6965 (8804), and speak H1696 (8765) unto them all that I command H6680 (8762) thee: be not dismayed H2865 (8735) at their faces H6440, lest I confound H2865 (8686) thee before H6440 them.
001:018 For, behold, I H0589 have made H5414 (8804) thee this day H3117 a defenced H4013 city H5892, and an iron H1270 pillar H5982, and brasen H5178 walls H2346 against the whole land H0776, against the kings H4428 of Judah H3063, against the princes H8269 thereof, against the priests H3548 thereof, and against the people H5971 of the land H0776.
001:019 And they shall fight H3898 (8738) against thee; but they shall not prevail H3201 (8799) against thee; for I [am] with thee, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, to deliver H5337 (8687) thee.
002:001 ¶  Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to me, saying H0559 (8800),
002:002 Go H1980 (8800) and cry H7121 (8804) in the ears H0241 of Jerusalem H3389, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; I remember H2142 (8804) thee, the kindness H2617 of thy youth H5271, the love H0160 of thine espousals H3623, when thou wentest H3212 (8800) after H0310 me in the wilderness H4057, in a land H0776 [that was] not sown H2232 (8803).
002:003 Israel H3478 [was] holiness H6944 unto the LORD H3068, [and] the firstfruits H7225 of his increase H8393: all that devour H0398 (8802) him shall offend H0816 (8799); evil H7451 shall come H0935 (8799) upon them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
002:004 Hear H8085 (8798) ye the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, O house H1004 of Jacob H3290, and all the families H4940 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478:
002:005 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, What iniquity H5766 have your fathers H0001 found H4672 (8804) in me, that they are gone far H7368 (8804) from me, and have walked H3212 (8799) after H0310 vanity H1892, and are become vain H1891 (8799)?
002:006 Neither said H0559 (8804) they, Where [is] the LORD H3068 that brought us up H5927 (8688) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, that led H3212 (8688) us through the wilderness H4057, through a land H0776 of deserts H6160 and of pits H7745, through a land H0776 of drought H6723, and of the shadow of death H6757, through a land H0776 that no man H0376 passed through H5674 (8804), and where no man H0120 dwelt H3427 (8804)?
002:007 And I brought H0935 (8686) you into a plentiful H3759 country H0776, to eat H0398 (8800) the fruit H6529 thereof and the goodness H2898 thereof; but when ye entered H0935 (8799), ye defiled H2930 (8762) my land H0776, and made H7760 (8804) mine heritage H5159 an abomination H8441.
002:008 The priests H3548 said H0559 (8804) not, Where [is] the LORD H3068? and they that handle H8610 (8802) the law H8451 knew H3045 (8804) me not: the pastors H7462 (8802) also transgressed H6586 (8804) against me, and the prophets H5030 prophesied H5012 (8738) by Baal H1168, and walked H1980 (8804) after H0310 [things that] do not profit H3276 (8686).
002:009 Wherefore I will yet plead H7378 (8799) with you, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and with your children’s H1121 children H1121 will I plead H7378 (8799).
002:010 For pass over H5674 (8798) the isles H0339 of Chittim H3794, and see H7200 (8798); and send H7971 (8798) unto Kedar H6938, and consider H0995 (8708) diligently H3966, and see H7200 (8798) if there be such a thing.
002:011 Hath a nation H1471 changed H3235 (8689) [their] gods H0430, which [are] yet no gods H0430? but my people H5971 have changed H4171 (8689) their glory H3519 for [that which] doth not profit H3276 (8686).
002:012 Be astonished H8074 (8798), O ye heavens H8064, at this, and be horribly afraid H8175 (8798), be ye very H3966 desolate H2717 (8798), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
002:013 For my people H5971 have committed H6213 (8804) two H8147 evils H7451; they have forsaken H5800 (8804) me the fountain H4726 of living H2416 waters H4325, [and] hewed them out H2672 (8800) cisterns H0877, broken H7665 (8737) cisterns H0877, that can hold H3557 (8686) no water H4325.
002:014 [Is] Israel H3478 a servant H5650? [is] he a homeborn H1004 H3211 [slave]? why H4069 is he spoiled H0957?
002:015 The young lions H3715 roared H7580 (8799) upon him, [and] yelled H5414 (8804) H6963, and they made H7896 (8799) his land H0776 waste H8047: his cities H5892 are burned H3341 (8738) without inhabitant H3427 (8802).
002:016 Also the children H1121 of Noph H5297 and Tahapanes H8471 have broken H7462 (8799) the crown of thy head H6936.
002:017 Hast thou not procured H6213 (8799) this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken H5800 (8800) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, when H6256 he led H3212 (8688) thee by the way H1870?
002:018 And now what hast thou to do in the way H1870 of Egypt H4714, to drink H8354 (8800) the waters H4325 of Sihor H7883? or what hast thou to do in the way H1870 of Assyria H0804, to drink H8354 (8800) the waters H4325 of the river H5104?
002:019 Thine own wickedness H7451 shall correct H3256 (8762) thee, and thy backslidings H4878 shall reprove H3198 (8686) thee: know H3045 (8798) therefore and see H7200 (8798) that [it is] an evil H7451 [thing] and bitter H4751, that thou hast forsaken H5800 (8800) the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and that my fear H6345 [is] not in thee, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635.
002:020 For of old time H5769 I have broken H7665 (8804) thy yoke H5923, [and] burst H5423 (8765) thy bands H4147; and thou saidst H0559 (8799), I will not transgress H5674 (8799) (8675) H5647 (8799); when upon every high H1364 hill H1389 and under every green H7488 tree H6086 thou wanderest H6808 (8802), playing the harlot H2181 (8802).
002:021 Yet I had planted H5193 (8804) thee a noble vine H8321, wholly a right H0571 seed H2233: how then art thou turned H2015 (8738) into the degenerate plant H5494 of a strange H5237 vine H1612 unto me?
002:022 For though thou wash H3526 (8762) thee with nitre H5427, and take thee much H7235 (8686) soap H1287, [yet] thine iniquity H5771 is marked H3799 (8737) before H6440 me, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069.
002:023 How canst thou say H0559 (8799), I am not polluted H2930 (8738), I have not gone H1980 (8804) after H0310 Baalim H1168? see H7200 (8798) thy way H1870 in the valley H1516, know H3045 (8798) what thou hast done H6213 (8804): [thou art] a swift H7031 dromedary H1072 traversing H8308 (8764) her ways H1870;
002:024 A wild ass H6501 used H3928 to the wilderness H4057, [that] snuffeth up H7602 (8804) the wind H7307 at her pleasure H0185 H5315; in her occasion H8385 who can turn her away H7725 (8686)? all they that seek H1245 (8764) her will not weary H3286 (8799) themselves; in her month H2320 they shall find H4672 (8799) her.
002:025 Withhold H4513 (8798) thy foot H7272 from being unshod H3182, and thy throat H1627 from thirst H6773: but thou saidst H0559 (8799), There is no hope H2976 (8737): no; for I have loved H0157 (8804) strangers H2114 (8801), and after H0310 them will I go H3212 (8799).
002:026 As the thief H1590 is ashamed H1322 when he is found H4672 (8735), so is the house H1004 of Israel H3478 ashamed H3001 (8689); they, their kings H4428, their princes H8269, and their priests H3548, and their prophets H5030,
002:027 Saying H0559 (8802) to a stock H6086, Thou [art] my father H0001; and to a stone H0068, Thou hast brought me forth H3205 (8804): for they have turned H6437 (8804) [their] back H6203 unto me, and not [their] face H6440: but in the time H6256 of their trouble H7451 they will say H0559 (8799), Arise H6965 (8798), and save H3467 (8685) us.
002:028 But where [are] thy gods H0430 that thou hast made H6213 (8804) thee? let them arise H6965 (8799), if they can save H3467 (8686) thee in the time H6256 of thy trouble H7451: for [according to] the number H4557 of thy cities H5892 are thy gods H0430, O Judah H3063.
002:029 Wherefore will ye plead H7378 (8799) with me? ye all have transgressed H6586 (8804) against me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
002:030 In vain H7723 have I smitten H5221 (8689) your children H1121; they received H3947 (8804) no correction H4148: your own sword H2719 hath devoured H0398 (8804) your prophets H5030, like a destroying H7843 (8688) lion H0738.
002:031 O generation H1755, see H7200 (8798) ye the word H1697 of the LORD H3068. Have I been a wilderness H4057 unto Israel H3478? a land H0776 of darkness H3991? wherefore say H0559 (8804) my people H5971, We are lords H7300 (8804); we will come H0935 (8799) no more unto thee?
002:032 Can a maid H1330 forget H7911 (8799) her ornaments H5716, [or] a bride H3618 her attire H7196? yet my people H5971 have forgotten H7911 (8804) me days H3117 without number H4557.
002:033 Why trimmest H3190 (8686) thou thy way H1870 to seek H1245 (8763) love H0160? therefore hast thou also taught H3925 (8765) the wicked ones H7451 thy ways H1870.
002:034 Also in thy skirts H3671 is found H4672 (8738) the blood H1818 of the souls H5315 of the poor H0034 innocents H5355: I have not found H4672 (8804) it by secret search H4290, but upon all these.
002:035 Yet thou sayest H0559 (8799), Because I am innocent H5352 (8738), surely his anger H0639 shall turn H7725 (8804) from me. Behold, I will plead H8199 (8737) with thee, because thou sayest H0559 (8800), I have not sinned H2398 (8804).
002:036 Why gaddest thou about H0235 (8799) so much H3966 to change H8138 (8763) thy way H1870? thou also shalt be ashamed H0954 (8799) of Egypt H4714, as thou wast ashamed H0954 (8804) of Assyria H0804.
002:037 Yea, thou shalt go forth H3318 (8799) from him, and thine hands H3027 upon thine head H7218: for the LORD H3068 hath rejected H3988 (8804) thy confidences H4009, and thou shalt not prosper H6743 (8686) in them.
003:001 ¶  They say H0559 (8800), If a man H0376 put away H7971 (8762) his wife H0802, and she go H1980 (8804) from him, and become another H0312 man’s H0376, shall he return unto her again H7725 (8799)? shall not that land H0776 be greatly H2610 (8800) polluted H2610 (8799)? but thou hast played the harlot H2181 (8804) with many H7227 lovers H7453; yet return again H7725 (8800) to me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
003:002 Lift up H5375 (8798) thine eyes H5869 unto the high places H8205, and see H7200 (8798) where H0375 thou hast not been lien H7693 (8795) (8676) H7901 (8795) with. In the ways H1870 hast thou sat H3427 (8804) for them, as the Arabian H6163 in the wilderness H4057; and thou hast polluted H2610 (8686) the land H0776 with thy whoredoms H2184 and with thy wickedness H7451.
003:003 Therefore the showers H7241 have been withholden H4513 (8735), and there hath been no latter rain H4456; and thou hadst a whore’s H2181 (8802) H0802 forehead H4696, thou refusedst H3985 (8765) to be ashamed H3637 (8736).
003:004 Wilt thou not from this time cry H7121 (8804) unto me, My father H0001, thou [art] the guide H0441 of my youth H5271?
003:005 Will he reserve H5201 (8799) [his anger] for ever H5769? will he keep H8104 (8799) [it] to the end H5331? Behold, thou hast spoken H1696 (8765) and done H6213 (8799) evil things H7451 as thou couldest H3201 (8799).
003:006 The LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) also unto me in the days H3117 of Josiah H2977 the king H4428, Hast thou seen H7200 (8804) [that] which backsliding H4878 Israel H3478 hath done H6213 (8804)? she is gone up H1980 (8802) upon every high H1364 mountain H2022 and under H8478 every green H7488 tree H6086, and there hath played the harlot H2181 (8799).
003:007 And I said H0559 (8799) after H0310 she had done H6213 (8800) all these [things], Turn H7725 (8799) thou unto me. But she returned H7725 (8804) not. And her treacherous H0901 sister H0269 Judah H3063 saw H7200 (8799) [it].
003:008 And I saw H7200 (8799), when for all the causes H0182 whereby backsliding H4878 Israel H3478 committed adultery H5003 (8765) I had put her away H7971 (8765), and given H5414 (8799) her a bill H5612 of divorce H3748; yet her treacherous H0898 (8802) sister H0269 Judah H3063 feared H3372 (8804) not, but went H3212 (8799) and played the harlot H2181 (8799) also.
003:009 And it came to pass through the lightness H6963 of her whoredom H2184, that she defiled H2610 (8799) the land H0776, and committed adultery H5003 (8799) with stones H0068 and with stocks H6086.
003:010 And yet for all this her treacherous H0901 sister H0269 Judah H3063 hath not turned H7725 (8804) unto me with her whole heart H3820, but feignedly H8267, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
003:011 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, The backsliding H4878 Israel H3478 hath justified H6663 (8765) herself H5315 more than treacherous H0898 (8802) Judah H3063.
003:012 Go H1980 (8800) and proclaim H7121 (8804) these words H1697 toward the north H6828, and say H0559 (8804), Return H7725 (8798), thou backsliding H4878 Israel H3478, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; [and] I will not cause mine anger H6440 to fall H5307 (8686) upon you: for I [am] merciful H2623, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, [and] I will not keep H5201 (8799) [anger] for ever H5769.
003:013 Only acknowledge H3045 (8798) thine iniquity H5771, that thou hast transgressed H6586 (8804) against the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and hast scattered H6340 (8762) thy ways H1870 to the strangers H2114 (8801) under every green H7488 tree H6086, and ye have not obeyed H8085 (8804) my voice H6963, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
003:014 Turn H7725 (8798), O backsliding H7726 children H1121, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; for I am married H1166 (8804) unto you: and I will take H3947 (8804) you one H0259 of a city H5892, and two H8147 of a family H4940, and I will bring H0935 (8689) you to Zion H6726:
003:015 And I will give H5414 (8804) you pastors H7462 (8802) according to mine heart H3820, which shall feed H7462 (8804) you with knowledge H1844 and understanding H7919 (8687).
003:016 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied H7235 (8799) and increased H6509 (8804) in the land H0776, in those days H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, they shall say H0559 (8799) no more, The ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068: neither shall it come H5927 (8799) to mind H3820: neither shall they remember H2142 (8799) it; neither shall they visit H6485 (8799) [it]; neither shall [that] be done H6213 (8735) any more.
003:017 At that time H6256 they shall call H7121 (8799) Jerusalem H3389 the throne H3678 of the LORD H3068; and all the nations H1471 shall be gathered H6960 (8738) unto it, to the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, to Jerusalem H3389: neither shall they walk H3212 (8799) any more after H0310 the imagination H8307 of their evil H7451 heart H3820.
003:018 In those days H3117 the house H1004 of Judah H3063 shall walk H3212 (8799) with the house H1004 of Israel H3478, and they shall come H0935 (8799) together H3162 out of the land H0776 of the north H6828 to the land H0776 that I have given for an inheritance H5157 (8689) unto your fathers H0001.
003:019 But I said H0559 (8804), How shall I put H7896 (8799) thee among the children H1121, and give H5414 (8799) thee a pleasant H2532 land H0776, a goodly H6643 heritage H5159 of the hosts H6635 of nations H1471? and I said H0559 (8799), Thou shalt call H7121 (8799) me, My father H0001; and shalt not turn away H7725 (8799) from me H0310.
003:020 Surely H0403 [as] a wife H0802 treacherously H0898 (8804) departeth from her husband H7453, so have ye dealt treacherously H0898 (8804) with me, O house H1004 of Israel H3478, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
003:021 A voice H6963 was heard H8085 (8738) upon the high places H8205, weeping H1065 [and] supplications H8469 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478: for they have perverted H5753 (8689) their way H1870, [and] they have forgotten H7911 (8804) the LORD H3068 their God H0430.
003:022 Return H7725 (8798), ye backsliding H7726 children H1121, [and] I will heal H7495 (8799) your backslidings H4878. Behold, we come H0857 (8804) unto thee; for thou [art] the LORD H3068 our God H0430.
003:023 Truly H0403 in vain H8267 [is salvation hoped for] from the hills H1389, [and from] the multitude H1995 of mountains H2022: truly H0403 in the LORD H3068 our God H0430 [is] the salvation H8668 of Israel H3478.
003:024 For shame H1322 hath devoured H0398 (8804) the labour H3018 of our fathers H0001 from our youth H5271; their flocks H6629 and their herds H1241, their sons H1121 and their daughters H1323.
003:025 We lie down H7901 (8799) in our shame H1322, and our confusion H3639 covereth H3680 (8762) us: for we have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068 our God H0430, we and our fathers H0001, from our youth H5271 even unto this day H3117, and have not obeyed H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430.
004:001 ¶  If thou wilt return H7725 (8799), O Israel H3478, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, return H7725 (8799) unto me: and if thou wilt put away H5493 (8686) thine abominations H8251 out of my sight H6440, then shalt thou not remove H5110 (8799).
004:002 And thou shalt swear H7650 (8738), The LORD H3068 liveth H2416, in truth H0571, in judgment H4941, and in righteousness H6666; and the nations H1471 shall bless H1288 (8694) themselves in him, and in him shall they glory H1984 (8691).
004:003 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 to the men H0376 of Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, Break up H5214 (8798) your fallow ground H5215, and sow H2232 (8799) not among thorns H6975.
004:004 Circumcise H4135 (8734) yourselves to the LORD H3068, and take away H5493 (8685) the foreskins H6190 of your heart H3824, ye men H0376 of Judah H3063 and inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389: lest my fury H2534 come forth H3318 (8799) like fire H0784, and burn H1197 (8804) that none can quench H3518 (8764) [it], because H6440 of the evil H7455 of your doings H4611.
004:005 Declare H5046 (8685) ye in Judah H3063, and publish H8085 (8685) in Jerusalem H3389; and say H0559 (8798), Blow H8628 (8798) ye the trumpet H7782 in the land H0776: cry H7121 (8798), gather together H4390 (8761), and say H0559 (8798), Assemble H0622 (8734) yourselves, and let us go H0935 (8799) into the defenced H4013 cities H5892.
004:006 Set up H5375 (8798) the standard H5251 toward Zion H6726: retire H5756 (8685), stay H5975 (8799) not: for I will bring H0935 (8688) evil H7451 from the north H6828, and a great H1419 destruction H7667.
004:007 The lion H0738 is come up H5927 (8804) from his thicket H5441, and the destroyer H7843 (8688) of the Gentiles H1471 is on his way H5265 (8804); he is gone forth H3318 (8804) from his place H4725 to make H7760 (8800) thy land H0776 desolate H8047; [and] thy cities H5892 shall be laid waste H5327 (8799), without an inhabitant H3427 (8802).
004:008 For this gird H2296 (8798) you with sackcloth H8242, lament H5594 (8798) and howl H3213 (8685): for the fierce H2740 anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 is not turned back H7725 (8804) from us.
004:009 And it shall come to pass at that day H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, [that] the heart H3820 of the king H4428 shall perish H0006 (8799), and the heart H3820 of the princes H8269; and the priests H3548 shall be astonished H8074 (8738), and the prophets H5030 shall wonder H8539 (8799).
004:010 Then said H0559 (8799) I, Ah H0162, Lord H0136 GOD H3069! surely H0403 thou hast greatly H5377 (8687) deceived H5377 (8689) this people H5971 and Jerusalem H3389, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall have peace H7965; whereas the sword H2719 reacheth H5060 (8804) unto the soul H5315.
004:011 At that time H6256 shall it be said H0559 (8735) to this people H5971 and to Jerusalem H3389, A dry H6703 wind H7307 of the high places H8205 in the wilderness H4057 toward H1870 the daughter H1323 of my people H5971, not to fan H2219 (8800), nor to cleanse H1305 (8687),
004:012 [Even] a full H4392 wind H7307 from those [places] shall come H0935 (8799) unto me: now also will I give H1696 (8762) sentence H4941 against them.
004:013 Behold, he shall come up H5927 (8799) as clouds H6051, and his chariots H4818 [shall be] as a whirlwind H5492: his horses H5483 are swifter H7043 (8804) than eagles H5404. Woe H0188 unto us! for we are spoiled H7703 (8795).
004:014 O Jerusalem H3389, wash H3526 (8761) thine heart H3820 from wickedness H7451, that thou mayest be saved H3467 (8735). How long shall thy vain H0205 thoughts H4284 lodge H3885 (8686) within H7130 thee?
004:015 For a voice H6963 declareth H5046 (8688) from Dan H1835, and publisheth H8085 (8688) affliction H0205 from mount H2022 Ephraim H0669.
004:016 Make ye mention H2142 (8685) to the nations H1471; behold, publish H8085 (8685) against Jerusalem H3389, [that] watchers H5341 (8802) come H0935 (8802) from a far H4801 country H0776, and give out H5414 (8799) their voice H6963 against the cities H5892 of Judah H3063.
004:017 As keepers H8104 (8802) of a field H7704, are they against her round about H5439; because she hath been rebellious H4784 (8804) against me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
004:018 Thy way H1870 and thy doings H4611 have procured H6213 (8804) these [things] unto thee; this [is] thy wickedness H7451, because it is bitter H4751, because it reacheth H5060 (8804) unto thine heart H3820.
004:019 My bowels H4578, my bowels H4578! I am pained H2342 (8799) (8675) H3176 (8686) at my very H7023 heart H3820; my heart H3820 maketh a noise H1993 (8802) in me; I cannot hold my peace H2790 (8686), because thou hast heard H8085 (8804), O my soul H5315, the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782, the alarm H8643 of war H4421.
004:020 Destruction H7667 upon destruction H7667 is cried H7121 (8738); for the whole land H0776 is spoiled H7703 (8795): suddenly H6597 are my tents H0168 spoiled H7703 (8795), [and] my curtains H3407 in a moment H7281.
004:021 How long shall I see H7200 (8799) the standard H5251, [and] hear H8085 (8799) the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782?
004:022 For my people H5971 [is] foolish H0191, they have not known H3045 (8804) me; they [are] sottish H5530 children H1121, and they have none understanding H0995 (8737): they [are] wise H2450 to do evil H7489 (8687), but to do good H3190 (8687) they have no knowledge H3045 (8804).
004:023 I beheld H7200 (8804) the earth H0776, and, lo, [it was] without form H8414, and void H0922; and the heavens H8064, and they [had] no light H0216.
004:024 I beheld H7200 (8804) the mountains H2022, and, lo, they trembled H7493 (8801), and all the hills H1389 moved lightly H7043 (8701).
004:025 I beheld H7200 (8804), and, lo, [there was] no man H0120, and all the birds H5775 of the heavens H8064 were fled H5074 (8804).
004:026 I beheld H7200 (8804), and, lo, the fruitful place H3759 [was] a wilderness H4057, and all the cities H5892 thereof were broken down H5422 (8738) at the presence H6440 of the LORD H3068, [and] by his fierce H2740 anger H0639.
004:027 For thus hath the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804), The whole land H0776 shall be desolate H8077; yet will I not make H6213 (8799) a full end H3617.
004:028 For this shall the earth H0776 mourn H0056 (8799), and the heavens H8064 above H4605 be black H6937 (8804): because I have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], I have purposed H2161 (8804) [it], and will not repent H5162 (8738), neither will I turn back H7725 (8799) from it.
004:029 The whole city H5892 shall flee H1272 (8802) for the noise H6963 of the horsemen H6571 and bowmen H7198 H7411 (8802); they shall go H0935 (8804) into thickets H5645, and climb up H5927 (8804) upon the rocks H3710: every city H5892 [shall be] forsaken H5800 (8803), and not a man H0376 dwell H3427 (8802) therein H2004.
004:030 And [when] thou [art] spoiled H7703 (8803), what wilt thou do H6213 (8799)? Though thou clothest H3847 (8799) thyself with crimson H8144, though thou deckest H5710 (8799) thee with ornaments H5716 of gold H2091, though thou rentest H7167 (8799) thy face H5869 with painting H6320, in vain H7723 shalt thou make thyself fair H3302 (8691); [thy] lovers H5689 (8802) will despise H3988 (8804) thee, they will seek H1245 (8762) thy life H5315.
004:031 For I have heard H8085 (8804) a voice H6963 as of a woman in travail H2470 (8802), [and] the anguish H6869 as of her that bringeth forth her first child H1069 (8688), the voice H6963 of the daughter H1323 of Zion H6726, [that] bewaileth H3306 (8691) herself, [that] spreadeth H6566 (8762) her hands H3709, [saying], Woe H0188 [is] me now! for my soul H5315 is wearied H5888 (8804) because of murderers H2026 (8802).
005:001 ¶  Run ye to and fro H7751 (8786) through the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389, and see H7200 (8798) now, and know H3045 (8798), and seek H1245 (8761) in the broad places H7339 thereof, if ye can find H4672 (8799) a man H0376, if there be H3426 [any] that executeth H6213 (8802) judgment H4941, that seeketh H1245 (8764) the truth H0530; and I will pardon H5545 (8799) it.
005:002 And though they say H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 liveth H2416; surely they swear H7650 (8735) falsely H8267.
005:003 O LORD H3068, [are] not thine eyes H5869 upon the truth H0530? thou hast stricken H5221 (8689) them, but they have not grieved H2342 (8804); thou hast consumed H3615 (8765) them, [but] they have refused H3985 (8765) to receive H3947 (8800) correction H4148: they have made their faces H6440 harder H2388 (8765) than a rock H5553; they have refused H3985 (8765) to return H7725 (8800).
005:004 Therefore I said H0559 (8804), Surely these [are] poor H1800; they are foolish H2973 (8738): for they know H3045 (8804) not the way H1870 of the LORD H3068, [nor] the judgment H4941 of their God H0430.
005:005 I will get H3212 (8799) me unto the great men H1419, and will speak H1696 (8762) unto them; for they have known H3045 (8804) the way H1870 of the LORD H3068, [and] the judgment H4941 of their God H0430: but these have altogether H3162 broken H7665 (8804) the yoke H5923, [and] burst H5423 (8765) the bonds H4147.
005:006 Wherefore a lion H0738 out of the forest H3293 shall slay H5221 (8689) them, [and] a wolf H2061 of the evenings H6160 shall spoil H7703 (8799) them, a leopard H5246 shall watch H8245 (8802) over their cities H5892: every one that goeth out H3318 (8802) thence shall H2007 be torn in pieces H2963 (8735): because their transgressions H6588 are many H7231 (8804), [and] their backslidings H4878 are increased H6105 (8804).
005:007 How H0335 shall I pardon H5545 (8799) thee for this H2063? thy children H1121 have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and sworn H7650 (8735) by [them that are] no H3808 gods H0430: when I had fed them to the full H7650 (8686), they then committed adultery H5003 (8799), and assembled themselves by troops H1413 (8704) in the harlots H2181 (8802) ’ houses H1004.
005:008 They were [as] fed H2109 (8716) horses H5483 in the morning H7904 (8688): every one H0376 neighed H6670 (8799) after his neighbour’s H7453 wife H0802.
005:009 Shall I not visit H6485 (8799) for these [things]? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: and shall not my soul H5315 be avenged H5358 (8691) on such a nation H1471 as this?
005:010 Go ye up H5927 (8798) upon her walls H8284, and destroy H7843 (8761); but make H6213 (8799) not a full end H3617: take away H5493 (8685) her battlements H5189; for they [are] not the LORD’S H3068.
005:011 For the house H1004 of Israel H3478 and the house H1004 of Judah H3063 have dealt very H0898 (8800) treacherously H0898 (8804) against me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
005:012 They have belied H3584 (8765) the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), [It is] not he; neither shall evil H7451 come H0935 (8799) upon us; neither shall we see H7200 (8799) sword H2719 nor famine H7458:
005:013 And the prophets H5030 shall become wind H7307, and the word H1696 (8763) [is] not in them: thus shall it be done H6213 (8735) unto them.
005:014 Wherefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of hosts H6635, Because ye speak H1696 (8763) this word H1697, behold, I will make H5414 (8802) my words H1697 in thy mouth H6310 fire H0784, and this people H5971 wood H6086, and it shall devour H0398 (8804) them.
005:015 Lo, I will bring H0935 (8688) a nation H1471 upon you from far H4801, O house H1004 of Israel H3478, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: it [is] a mighty H0386 nation H1471, it [is] an ancient H5769 nation H1471, a nation H1471 whose language H3956 thou knowest H3045 (8799) not, neither understandest H8085 (8799) what they say H1696 (8762).
005:016 Their quiver H0827 [is] as an open H6605 (8803) sepulchre H6913, they [are] all mighty men H1368.
005:017 And they shall eat up H0398 (8804) thine harvest H7105, and thy bread H3899, [which] thy sons H1121 and thy daughters H1323 should eat H0398 (8799): they shall eat up H0398 (8799) thy flocks H6629 and thine herds H1241: they shall eat up H0398 (8799) thy vines H1612 and thy fig trees H8384: they shall impoverish H7567 (8779) thy fenced H4013 cities H5892, wherein thou H2007 trustedst H0982 (8802), with the sword H2719.
005:018 Nevertheless in those days H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, I will not make H6213 (8799) a full end H3617 with you.
005:019 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say H0559 (8799), Wherefore H8478 H4100 doeth H6213 (8804) the LORD H3068 our God H0430 all these [things] unto us? then shalt thou answer H0559 (8804) them, Like as ye have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and served H5647 (8799) strange H5236 gods H0430 in your land H0776, so shall ye serve H5647 (8799) strangers H2114 (8801) in a land H0776 [that is] not yours.
005:020 Declare H5046 (8685) this in the house H1004 of Jacob H3290, and publish H8085 (8685) it in Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800),
005:021 Hear H8085 (8798) now this, O foolish H5530 people H5971, and without understanding H3820; which have eyes H5869, and see H7200 (8799) not; which have ears H0241, and hear H8085 (8799) not:
005:022 Fear H3372 (8799) ye not me? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: will ye not tremble H2342 (8799) at my presence H6440, which have placed H7760 (8804) the sand H2344 [for] the bound H1366 of the sea H3220 by a perpetual H5769 decree H2706, that it cannot pass H5674 (8799) it: and though the waves H1530 thereof toss H1607 (8691) themselves, yet can they not prevail H3201 (8799); though they roar H1993 (8804), yet can they not pass over H5674 (8799) it?
005:023 But this people H5971 hath a revolting H5637 (8802) and a rebellious H4784 (8802) heart H3820; they are revolted H5493 (8804) and gone H3212 (8799).
005:024 Neither say H0559 (8804) they in their heart H3824, Let us now fear H3372 (8799) the LORD H3068 our God H0430, that giveth H5414 (8802) rain H1653, both the former H3138 and the latter H4456, in his season H6256: he reserveth H8104 (8799) unto us the appointed H2708 weeks H7620 of the harvest H7105.
005:025 Your iniquities H5771 have turned away H5186 (8689) these [things], and your sins H2403 have withholden H4513 (8804) good H2896 [things] from you.
005:026 For among my people H5971 are found H4672 (8738) wicked H7563 [men]: they lay wait H7789 (8799), as he that setteth H7918 (8800) snares H3353; they set H5324 (8689) a trap H4889, they catch H3920 (8799) men H0582.
005:027 As a cage H3619 is full H4392 of birds H5775, so [are] their houses H1004 full H4392 of deceit H4820: therefore they are become great H1431 (8804), and waxen rich H6238 (8686).
005:028 They are waxen fat H8080 (8804), they shine H6245 (8804): yea, they overpass H5674 (8804) the deeds H1697 of the wicked H7451: they judge H1777 (8804) not the cause H1779, the cause of the fatherless H3490, yet they prosper H6743 (8686); and the right H4941 of the needy H0034 do they not judge H8199 (8804).
005:029 Shall I not visit H6485 (8799) for these [things]? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: shall not my soul H5315 be avenged H5358 (8691) on such a nation H1471 as this?
005:030 A wonderful H8047 and horrible thing H8186 is committed H1961 (8738) in the land H0776;
005:031 The prophets H5030 prophesy H5012 (8738) falsely H8267, and the priests H3548 bear rule H7287 (8799) by their means H3027; and my people H5971 love H0157 (8804) [to have it] so: and what will ye do H6213 (8799) in the end H0319 thereof?
006:001 ¶  O ye children H1121 of Benjamin H1144, gather yourselves to flee H5756 (8685) out of the midst H7130 of Jerusalem H3389, and blow H8628 (8798) the trumpet H7782 in Tekoa H8620, and set up H5375 (8798) a sign H4864 of fire in Bethhaccerem H1021: for evil H7451 appeareth H8259 (8738) out of the north H6828, and great H1419 destruction H7667.
006:002 I have likened H1820 (8804) the daughter H1323 of Zion H6726 to a comely H5116 and delicate H6026 (8794) [woman].
006:003 The shepherds H7462 (8802) with their flocks H5739 shall come H0935 (8799) unto her; they shall pitch H8628 (8804) [their] tents H0168 against her round about H5439; they shall feed H7462 (8804) every one H0376 in his place H3027.
006:004 Prepare H6942 (8761) ye war H4421 against her; arise H6965 (8798), and let us go up H5927 (8799) at noon H6672. Woe H0188 unto us! for the day H3117 goeth away H6437 (8804), for the shadows H6752 of the evening H6153 are stretched out H5186 (8735).
006:005 Arise H6965 (8798), and let us go H5927 (8799) by night H3915, and let us destroy H7843 (8686) her palaces H0759.
006:006 For thus hath the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 said H0559 (8804), Hew ye down H3772 (8798) trees H6097, and cast H8210 (8798) a mount H5550 against Jerusalem H3389: this [is] the city H5892 to be visited H6485 (8717); she [is] wholly oppression H6233 in the midst H7130 of her.
006:007 As a fountain H0953 casteth out H6979 (8687) her waters H4325, so she casteth out H6979 (8689) her wickedness H7451: violence H2555 and spoil H7701 is heard H8085 (8735) in her; before me H6440 continually H8548 [is] grief H2483 and wounds H4347.
006:008 Be thou instructed H3256 (8734), O Jerusalem H3389, lest my soul H5315 depart H3363 (8799) from thee; lest I make H7760 (8799) thee desolate H8077, a land H0776 not inhabited H3427 (8738).
006:009 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, They shall throughly H5953 (8780) glean H5953 (8779) the remnant H7611 of Israel H3478 as a vine H1612: turn back H7725 (8685) thine hand H3027 as a grapegatherer H1219 (8802) into the baskets H5552.
006:010 To whom shall I speak H1696 (8762), and give warning H5749 (8686), that they may hear H8085 (8799)? behold, their ear H0241 [is] uncircumcised H6189, and they cannot H3201 (8799) hearken H7181 (8687): behold, the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 is unto them a reproach H2781; they have no delight H2654 (8799) in it.
006:011 Therefore I am full H4392 of the fury H2534 of the LORD H3068; I am weary H3811 (8738) with holding in H3557 (8687): I will pour it out H8210 (8800) upon the children H5768 abroad H2351, and upon the assembly H5475 of young men H0970 together H3162: for even the husband H0376 with the wife H0802 shall be taken H3920 (8735), the aged H2205 with [him that is] full H4390 (8804) of days H3117.
006:012 And their houses H1004 shall be turned H5437 (8738) unto others H0312, [with their] fields H7704 and wives H0802 together H3162: for I will stretch out H5186 (8686) my hand H3027 upon the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
006:013 For from the least H6996 of them even unto the greatest H1419 of them every one [is] given H1214 (8802) to covetousness H1215; and from the prophet H5030 even unto the priest H3548 every one dealeth H6213 (8802) falsely H8267.
006:014 They have healed H7495 (8762) also the hurt H7667 [of the daughter H1323 (8676) ] of my people H5971 slightly H7043 (8738), saying H0559 (8800), Peace H7965, peace H7965; when [there is] no peace H7965.
006:015 Were they ashamed H3001 (8689) when they had committed H6213 (8804) abomination H8441? nay H1571, they were not at all H0954 (8800) ashamed H0954 (8799), neither H1571 could H3045 (8804) they blush H3637 (8687): therefore they shall fall H5307 (8799) among them that fall H5307 (8802): at the time H6256 [that] I visit H6485 (8804) them they shall be cast down H3782 (8735), saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
006:016 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Stand H5975 (8798) ye in the ways H1870, and see H7200 (8799), and ask H7592 (8798) for the old H5769 paths H5410, where [is] the good H2896 way H1870, and walk H3212 (8799) therein, and ye shall find H4672 (8798) rest H4771 for your souls H5315. But they said H0559 (8799), We will not walk H3212 (8798) [therein].
006:017 Also I set H6965 (8689) watchmen H6822 (8802) over you, [saying], Hearken H7181 (8685) to the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782. But they said H0559 (8799), We will not hearken H7181 (8686).
006:018 Therefore hear H8085 (8798), ye nations H1471, and know H3045 (8798), O congregation H5712, what [is] among them.
006:019 Hear H8085 (8798), O earth H0776: behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) evil H7451 upon this people H5971, [even] the fruit H6529 of their thoughts H4284, because they have not hearkened H7181 (8689) unto my words H1697, nor to my law H8451, but rejected H3988 (8799) it.
006:020 To what purpose cometh H0935 (8799) there to me incense H3828 from Sheba H7614, and the sweet H2896 cane H7070 from a far H4801 country H0776? your burnt offerings H5930 [are] not acceptable H7522, nor your sacrifices H2077 sweet H6149 (8804) unto me.
006:021 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will lay H5414 (8802) stumblingblocks H4383 before this people H5971, and the fathers H0001 and the sons H1121 together H3162 shall fall H3782 (8804) upon them; the neighbour H7934 and his friend H7453 shall perish H0006 (8804).
006:022 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, a people H5971 cometh H0935 (8802) from the north H6828 country H0776, and a great H1419 nation H1471 shall be raised H5782 (8735) from the sides H3411 of the earth H0776.
006:023 They shall lay hold H2388 (8686) on bow H7198 and spear H3591; they [are] cruel H0394, and have no mercy H7355 (8762); their voice H6963 roareth H1993 (8799) like the sea H3220; and they ride H7392 (8799) upon horses H5483, set in array H6186 (8803) as men H0376 for war H4421 against thee, O daughter H1323 of Zion H6726.
006:024 We have heard H8085 (8804) the fame H8089 thereof: our hands H3027 wax feeble H7503 (8804): anguish H6869 hath taken hold H2388 (8689) of us, [and] pain H2427, as of a woman in travail H3205 (8802).
006:025 Go not forth H3318 (8799) into the field H7704, nor walk H3212 (8799) by the way H1870; for the sword H2719 of the enemy H0341 (8802) [and] fear H4032 [is] on every side H5439.
006:026 O daughter H1323 of my people H5971, gird H2296 (8798) [thee] with sackcloth H8242, and wallow H6428 (8690) thyself in ashes H0665: make H6213 (8798) thee mourning H0060, [as for] an only son H3173, most bitter H8563 lamentation H4553: for the spoiler H7703 (8802) shall suddenly H6597 come H0935 (8799) upon us.
006:027 I have set H5414 (8804) thee [for] a tower H0969 [and] a fortress H4013 among my people H5971, that thou mayest know H3045 (8799) and try H0974 (8804) their way H1870.
006:028 They [are] all grievous H5493 (8802) revolters H5637 (8802), walking H1980 (8802) with slanders H7400: [they are] brass H5178 and iron H1270; they [are] all corrupters H7843 (8688).
006:029 The bellows H4647 are burned H2787 (8738), the lead H5777 is consumed H8552 (8804) of the fire H0800 H0784; the founder H6884 (8800) melteth H6884 (8804) in vain H7723: for the wicked H7451 are not plucked away H5423 (8738).
006:030 Reprobate H3988 (8737) silver H3701 shall [men] call H7121 (8804) them, because the LORD H3068 hath rejected H3988 (8804) them.
007:001 ¶  The word H1697 that came to Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
007:002 Stand H5975 (8798) in the gate H8179 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004, and proclaim H7121 (8804) there this word H1697, and say H0559 (8804), Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, all [ye of] Judah H3063, that enter in H0935 (8802) at these gates H8179 to worship H7812 (8692) the LORD H3068.
007:003 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, Amend H3190 (8685) your ways H1870 and your doings H4611, and I will cause you to dwell H7931 (8762) in this place H4725.
007:004 Trust H0982 (8799) ye not in lying H8267 words H1697, saying H0559 (8800), The temple H1964 of the LORD H3068, The temple H1964 of the LORD H3068, The temple H1964 of the LORD H3068, [are] these.
007:005 For if ye throughly H3190 (8687) amend H3190 (8686) your ways H1870 and your doings H4611; if ye throughly H6213 (8800) execute H6213 (8799) judgment H4941 between a man H0376 and his neighbour H7453;
007:006 [If] ye oppress H6231 (8799) not the stranger H1616, the fatherless H3490, and the widow H0490, and shed H8210 (8799) not innocent H5355 blood H1818 in this place H4725, neither walk H3212 (8799) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430 to your hurt H7451:
007:007 Then will I cause you to dwell H7931 (8765) in this place H4725, in the land H0776 that I gave H5414 (8804) to your fathers H0001, for H5704 ever H5769 and ever H5769.
007:008 Behold, ye trust H0982 (8802) in lying H8267 words H1697, that cannot profit H3276 (8687).
007:009 Will ye steal H1589 (8800), murder H7523 (8800), and commit adultery H5003 (8800), and swear H7650 (8736) falsely H8267, and burn incense H6999 (8763) unto Baal H1168, and walk H1980 (8800) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430 whom ye know H3045 (8804) not;
007:010 And come H0935 (8804) and stand H5975 (8804) before H6440 me in this house H1004, which is called H7121 (8738) by my name H8034, and say H0559 (8804), We are delivered H5337 (8738) to do H6213 (8800) all these abominations H8441?
007:011 Is this house H1004, which is called H7121 (8738) by my name H8034, become a den H4631 of robbers H6530 in your eyes H5869? Behold, even I have seen H7200 (8804) [it], saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
007:012 But go H3212 (8798) ye now unto my place H4725 which [was] in Shiloh H7887, where I set H7931 (8765) my name H8034 at the first H7223, and see H7200 (8798) what I did H6213 (8804) to it for H6440 the wickedness H7451 of my people H5971 Israel H3478.
007:013 And now, because ye have done H6213 (8800) all these works H4639, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and I spake H1696 (8762) unto you, rising up early H7925 (8687) and speaking H1696 (8763), but ye heard H8085 (8804) not; and I called H7121 (8799) you, but ye answered H6030 (8804) not;
007:014 Therefore will I do H6213 (8804) unto [this] house H1004, which is called H7121 (8738) by my name H8034, wherein ye trust H0982 (8802), and unto the place H4725 which I gave H5414 (8804) to you and to your fathers H0001, as I have done H6213 (8804) to Shiloh H7887.
007:015 And I will cast you out H7993 (8689) of my sight H6440, as I have cast out H7993 (8689) all your brethren H0251, [even] the whole seed H2233 of Ephraim H0669.
007:016 Therefore pray H6419 (8691) not thou for this people H5971, neither lift up H5375 (8799) cry H7440 nor prayer H8605 for them H1157, neither make intercession H6293 (8799) to me: for I will not hear H8085 (8802) thee.
007:017 Seest H7200 (8802) thou not what they do H6213 (8802) in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 and in the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389?
007:018 The children H1121 gather H3950 (8764) wood H6086, and the fathers H0001 kindle H1197 (8764) the fire H0784, and the women H0802 knead H3888 (8802) [their] dough H1217, to make H6213 (8800) cakes H3561 to the queen H4446 of heaven H8064, and to pour out H5258 (8687) drink offerings H5262 unto other H0312 gods H0430, that they may provoke me to anger H3707 (8687).
007:019 Do they provoke me to anger H3707 (8688)? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: [do they] not [provoke] themselves to the confusion H1322 of their own faces H6440?
007:020 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069; Behold, mine anger H0639 and my fury H2534 shall be poured out H5413 (8737) upon this place H4725, upon man H0120, and upon beast H0929, and upon the trees H6086 of the field H7704, and upon the fruit H6529 of the ground H0127; and it shall burn H1197 (8804), and shall not be quenched H3518 (8799).
007:021 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Put H5595 (8798) your burnt offerings H5930 unto your sacrifices H2077, and eat H0398 (8798) flesh H1320.
007:022 For I spake H1696 (8765) not unto your fathers H0001, nor commanded H6680 (8765) them in the day H3117 that I brought them out H3318 (8687) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, concerning H1697 burnt offerings H5930 or sacrifices H2077:
007:023 But this thing H1697 commanded H6680 (8765) I them, saying H0559 (8800), Obey H8085 (8798) my voice H6963, and I will be your God H0430, and ye shall be my people H5971: and walk H1980 (8804) ye in all the ways H1870 that I have commanded H6680 (8762) you, that it may be well H3190 (8799) unto you.
007:024 But they hearkened H8085 (8804) not, nor inclined H5186 (8689) their ear H0241, but walked H3212 (8799) in the counsels H4156 [and] in the imagination H8307 of their evil H7451 heart H3820, and went backward H0268, and not forward H6440.
007:025 Since the day H3117 that your fathers H0001 came forth out H3318 (8804) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 unto this day H3117 I have even sent H7971 (8799) unto you all my servants H5650 the prophets H5030, daily H3117 rising up early H7925 (8687) and sending H7971 (8800) [them]:
007:026 Yet they hearkened H8085 (8804) not unto me, nor inclined H5186 (8689) their ear H0241, but hardened H7185 (8686) their neck H6203: they did worse H7489 (8689) than their fathers H0001.
007:027 Therefore thou shalt speak H1696 (8765) all these words H1697 unto them; but they will not hearken H8085 (8799) to thee: thou shalt also call H7121 (8804) unto them; but they will not answer H6030 (8799) thee.
007:028 But thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, This [is] a nation H1471 that obeyeth H8085 (8804) not the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 their God H0430, nor receiveth H3947 (8804) correction H4148: truth H0530 is perished H0006 (8804), and is cut off H3772 (8738) from their mouth H6310.
007:029 Cut off H1494 (8798) thine hair H5145, [O Jerusalem], and cast [it] away H7993 (8685), and take up H5375 (8798) a lamentation H7015 on high places H8205; for the LORD H3068 hath rejected H3988 (8804) and forsaken H5203 (8799) the generation H1755 of his wrath H5678.
007:030 For the children H1121 of Judah H3063 have done H6213 (8804) evil H7451 in my sight H5869, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: they have set H7760 (8804) their abominations H8251 in the house H1004 which is called H7121 (8738) by my name H8034, to pollute H2930 (8763) it.
007:031 And they have built H1129 (8804) the high places H1116 of Tophet H8612, which [is] in the valley H1516 of the son H1121 of Hinnom H2011, to burn H8313 (8800) their sons H1121 and their daughters H1323 in the fire H0784; which I commanded H6680 (8765) [them] not, neither came H5927 (8804) it into my heart H3820.
007:032 Therefore, behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that it shall no more be called H0559 (8735) Tophet H8612, nor the valley H1516 of the son H1121 of Hinnom H2011, but the valley H1516 of slaughter H2028: for they shall bury H6912 (8804) in Tophet H8612, till there be no H0369 place H4725.
007:033 And the carcases H5038 of this people H5971 shall be meat H3978 for the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064, and for the beasts H0929 of the earth H0776; and none shall fray [them] away H2729 (8688).
007:034 Then will I cause to cease H7673 (8689) from the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and from the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389, the voice H6963 of mirth H8342, and the voice H6963 of gladness H8057, the voice H6963 of the bridegroom H2860, and the voice H6963 of the bride H3618: for the land H0776 shall be desolate H2723.
008:001 ¶  At that time H6256, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, they shall bring out H3318 (8686) the bones H6106 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063, and the bones H6106 of his princes H8269, and the bones H6106 of the priests H3548, and the bones H6106 of the prophets H5030, and the bones H6106 of the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, out of their graves H6913:
008:002 And they shall spread H7849 (8804) them before the sun H8121, and the moon H3394, and all the host H6635 of heaven H8064, whom they have loved H0157 (8804), and whom they have served H5647 (8804), and after H0310 whom they have walked H1980 (8804), and whom they have sought H1875 (8804), and whom they have worshipped H7812 (8694): they shall not be gathered H0622 (8735), nor be buried H6912 (8735); they shall be for dung H1828 upon the face H6440 of the earth H0127.
008:003 And death H4194 shall be chosen H0977 (8738) rather than life H2416 by all the residue H7611 of them that remain H7604 (8737) of this evil H7451 family H4940, which remain H7604 (8737) in all the places H4725 whither I have driven H5080 (8689) them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
008:004 Moreover thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Shall they fall H5307 (8799), and not arise H6965 (8799)? shall he turn away H7725 (8799), and not return H7725 (8799)?
008:005 Why [then] is this people H5971 of Jerusalem H3389 slidden back H7725 (8790) by a perpetual H5329 (8737) backsliding H4878? they hold H2388 (8689) fast deceit H8649, they refuse H3985 (8765) to return H7725 (8800).
008:006 I hearkened H7181 (8689) and heard H8085 (8799), [but] they spake not aright H1696 (8762): no man H0376 repented H5162 (8737) him of H5921 his wickedness H7451, saying H0559 (8800), What have I done H6213 (8804)? every one turned H7725 (8804) to his course H4794, as the horse H5483 rusheth H7857 (8802) into the battle H4421.
008:007 Yea, the stork H2624 in the heaven H8064 knoweth H3045 (8804) her appointed times H4150; and the turtle H8449 and the crane H5483 and the swallow H5693 observe H8104 (8804) the time H6256 of their coming H0935 (8800); but my people H5971 know H3045 (8804) not the judgment H4941 of the LORD H3068.
008:008 How do ye say H0559 (8799), We [are] wise H2450, and the law H8451 of the LORD H3068 [is] with us? Lo, certainly H0403 in vain H8267 made H6213 (8804) he [it]; the pen H5842 of the scribes H5608 (8802) [is] in vain H8267.
008:009 The wise H2450 [men] are ashamed H3001 (8689), they are dismayed H2865 (8804) and taken H3920 (8735): lo, they have rejected H3988 (8804) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068; and what wisdom H2451 [is] in them?
008:010 Therefore will I give H5414 (8799) their wives H0802 unto others H0312, [and] their fields H7704 to them that shall inherit H3423 (8802) [them]: for every one from the least H6996 even unto the greatest H1419 is given H1214 (8802) to covetousness H1215, from the prophet H5030 even unto the priest H3548 every one dealeth H6213 (8802) falsely H8267.
008:011 For they have healed H7495 (8762) the hurt H7667 of the daughter H1323 of my people H5971 slightly H7043 (8738), saying H0559 (8800), Peace H7965, peace H7965; when [there is] no peace H7965.
008:012 Were they ashamed H3001 (8689) when they had committed H6213 (8804) abomination H8441? nay, they were not at all H0954 (8800) ashamed H0954 (8799), neither could H3045 (8804) they blush H3637 (8736): therefore shall they fall H5307 (8799) among them that fall H5307 (8802): in the time H6256 of their visitation H6486 they shall be cast down H3782 (8735), saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
008:013 I will surely H0622 (8800) consume H5486 (8686) them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: [there shall be] no grapes H6025 on the vine H1612, nor figs H8384 on the fig tree H8384, and the leaf H5929 shall fade H5034 (8804); and [the things that] I have given H5414 (8799) them shall pass away H5674 (8799) from them.
008:014 Why do we sit still H3427 (8802)? assemble H0622 (8734) yourselves, and let us enter H0935 (8799) into the defenced H4013 cities H5892, and let us be silent H1826 (8735) there: for the LORD H3068 our God H0430 hath put us to silence H1826 (8689), and given us water H4325 of gall H7219 to drink H8248 (8686), because we have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068.
008:015 We looked H6960 (8763) for peace H7965, but no good H2896 [came; and] for a time H6256 of health H4832, and behold trouble H1205!
008:016 The snorting H5170 of his horses H5483 was heard H8085 (8738) from Dan H1835: the whole land H0776 trembled H7493 (8804) at the sound H6963 of the neighing H4684 of his strong ones H0047; for they are come H0935 (8799), and have devoured H0398 (8799) the land H0776, and all H4393 that is in it; the city H5892, and those that dwell H3427 (8802) therein.
008:017 For, behold, I will send H7971 (8764) serpents H5175, cockatrices H6848, among you, which [will] not [be] charmed H3908, and they shall bite H5391 (8765) you, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
008:018 [When] I would comfort H4010 myself against sorrow H3015, my heart H3820 [is] faint H1742 in me.
008:019 Behold the voice H6963 of the cry H7775 of the daughter H1323 of my people H5971 because of them that dwell in a far H4801 country H0776: [Is] not the LORD H3068 in Zion H6726? [is] not her king H4428 in her? Why have they provoked me to anger H3707 (8689) with their graven images H6456, [and] with strange H5236 vanities H1892?
008:020 The harvest H7105 is past H5674 (8804), the summer H7019 is ended H3615 (8804), and we are not saved H3467 (8738).
008:021 For the hurt H7667 of the daughter H1323 of my people H5971 am I hurt H7665 (8717); I am black H6937 (8804); astonishment H8047 hath taken hold H2388 (8689) on me.
008:022 [Is there] no balm H6875 in Gilead H1568; [is there] no physician H7495 (8802) there? why then H3588 is not the health H0724 of the daughter H1323 of my people H5971 recovered H5927 (8804)?
009:001 ¶  Oh that H5414 (8799) my head H7218 were waters H4325, and mine eyes H5869 a fountain H4726 of tears H1832, that I might weep H1058 (8799) day H3119 and night H3915 for the slain H2491 of the daughter H1323 of my people H5971!
009:002 Oh that H5414 (8799) I had in the wilderness H4057 a lodging place H4411 of wayfaring men H0732 (8802); that I might leave H5800 (8799) my people H5971, and go H3212 (8799) from them! for they [be] all adulterers H5003 (8764), an assembly H6116 of treacherous men H0898 (8802).
009:003 And they bend H1869 (8686) their tongues H3956 [like] their bow H7198 [for] lies H8267: but they are not valiant H1396 (8804) for the truth H0530 upon the earth H0776; for they proceed H3318 (8804) from evil H7451 to evil H7451, and they know H3045 (8804) not me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
009:004 Take ye heed H8104 (8734) every one H0376 of his neighbour H7453, and trust H0982 (8799) ye not in any brother H0251: for every brother H0251 will utterly H6117 (8800) supplant H6117 (8799), and every neighbour H7453 will walk H1980 (8799) with slanders H7400.
009:005 And they will deceive H2048 (8762) every one H0376 his neighbour H7453, and will not speak H1696 (8762) the truth H0571: they have taught H3925 (8765) their tongue H3956 to speak H1696 (8763) lies H8267, [and] weary H3811 (8738) themselves to commit iniquity H5753 (8687).
009:006 Thine habitation H3427 (8800) [is] in the midst H8432 of deceit H4820; through deceit H4820 they refuse H3985 (8765) to know H3045 (8800) me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
009:007 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, Behold, I will melt H6884 (8802) them, and try H0974 (8804) them; for how shall I do H6213 (8799) for H6440 the daughter H1323 of my people H5971?
009:008 Their tongue H3956 [is as] an arrow H2671 shot out H7819 (8803); it speaketh H1696 (8765) deceit H4820: [one] speaketh H1696 (8762) peaceably H7965 to his neighbour H7453 with his mouth H6310, but in heart H7130 he layeth H7760 (8799) his wait H0696.
009:009 Shall I not visit H6485 (8799) them for these [things]? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: shall not my soul H5315 be avenged H5358 (8691) on such a nation H1471 as this?
009:010 For the mountains H2022 will I take up H5375 (8799) a weeping H1065 and wailing H5092, and for the habitations H4999 of the wilderness H4057 a lamentation H7015, because they are burned up H3341 (8738), so that none H0376 can pass H5674 (8802) through [them]; neither can [men] hear H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the cattle H4735; both the fowl H5775 of the heavens H8064 and the beast H0929 are fled H5074 (8804); they are gone H1980 (8804).
009:011 And I will make H5414 (8804) Jerusalem H3389 heaps H1530, [and] a den H4583 of dragons H8577; and I will make H5414 (8799) the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 desolate H8077, without an inhabitant H3427 (8802).
009:012 Who [is] the wise H2450 man H0376, that may understand H0995 (8799) this? and [who is he] to whom the mouth H6310 of the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765), that he may declare H5046 (8686) it, for what the land H0776 perisheth H0006 (8804) [and] is burned up H3341 (8738) like a wilderness H4057, that none passeth through H5674 (8802)?
009:013 And the LORD H3068 saith H0559 (8799), Because they have forsaken H5800 (8800) my law H8451 which I set H5414 (8804) before H6440 them, and have not obeyed H8085 (8804) my voice H6963, neither walked H1980 (8804) therein;
009:014 But have walked H3212 (8799) after H0310 the imagination H8307 of their own heart H3820, and after H0310 Baalim H1168, which their fathers H0001 taught H3925 (8765) them:
009:015 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will feed H0398 (8688) them, [even] this people H5971, with wormwood H3939, and give them water H4325 of gall H7219 to drink H8248 (8689).
009:016 I will scatter H6327 (8689) them also among the heathen H1471, whom neither they nor their fathers H0001 have known H3045 (8804): and I will send H7971 (8765) a sword H2719 after H0310 them, till I have consumed H3615 (8763) them.
009:017 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, Consider H0995 (8708) ye, and call H7121 (8798) for the mourning women H6969 (8789), that they may come H0935 (8799); and send H7971 (8798) for cunning H2450 [women], that they may come H0935 (8799):
009:018 And let them make haste H4116 (8762), and take up H5375 (8799) a wailing H5092 for us, that our eyes H5869 may run down H3381 (8799) with tears H1832, and our eyelids H6079 gush out H5140 (8799) with waters H4325.
009:019 For a voice H6963 of wailing H5092 is heard H8085 (8738) out of Zion H6726, How are we spoiled H7703 (8795)! we are greatly H3966 confounded H0954 (8804), because we have forsaken H5800 (8804) the land H0776, because our dwellings H4908 have cast [us] out H7993 (8689).
009:020 Yet hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, O ye women H0802, and let your ear H0241 receive H3947 (8799) the word H1697 of his mouth H6310, and teach H3925 (8761) your daughters H1323 wailing H5092, and every one H0802 her neighbour H7468 lamentation H7015.
009:021 For death H4194 is come up H5927 (8804) into our windows H2474, [and] is entered H0935 (8804) into our palaces H0759, to cut off H3772 (8687) the children H5768 from without H2351, [and] the young men H0970 from the streets H7339.
009:022 Speak H1696 (8761), Thus saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, Even the carcases H5038 of men H0120 shall fall H5307 (8804) as dung H1828 upon the open H6440 field H7704, and as the handful H5995 after H0310 the harvestman H7114 (8802), and none shall gather H0622 (8764) [them].
009:023 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Let not the wise H2450 [man] glory H1984 (8691) in his wisdom H2451, neither let the mighty H1368 [man] glory H1984 (8691) in his might H1369, let not the rich H6223 [man] glory H1984 (8691) in his riches H6239:
009:024 But let him that glorieth H1984 (8693) glory H1984 (8691) in this, that he understandeth H7919 (8687) and knoweth H3045 (8800) me, that I [am] the LORD H3068 which exercise H6213 (8802) lovingkindness H2617, judgment H4941, and righteousness H6666, in the earth H0776: for in these [things] I delight H2654 (8804), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
009:025 Behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I will punish H6485 (8804) all [them which are] circumcised H4135 (8803) with the uncircumcised H6190;
009:026 Egypt H4714, and Judah H3063, and Edom H0123, and the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and Moab H4124, and all [that are] in the utmost H7112 (8803) corners H6285, that dwell H3427 (8802) in the wilderness H4057: for all [these] nations H1471 [are] uncircumcised H6189, and all the house H1004 of Israel H3478 [are] uncircumcised H6189 in the heart H3820.
010:001 ¶  Hear H8085 (8798) ye the word H1697 which the LORD H3068 speaketh H1696 (8765) unto you, O house H1004 of Israel H3478:
010:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Learn H3925 (8799) not the way H1870 of the heathen H1471, and be not dismayed H2865 (8735) at the signs H0226 of heaven H8064; for the heathen H1471 are dismayed H2865 (8735) at them H1992.
010:003 For the customs H2708 of the people H5971 [are] vain H1892: for [one] cutteth H3772 (8804) a tree H6086 out of the forest H3293, the work H4639 of the hands H3027 of the workman H2796, with the axe H4621.
010:004 They deck H3302 (8762) it with silver H3701 and with gold H2091; they fasten H2388 (8762) it with nails H4548 and with hammers H4717, that it move H6328 (8686) not.
010:005 They [are] upright H4749 as the palm tree H8560, but speak H1696 (8762) not: they must needs H5375 (8800) be borne H5375 (8735), because they cannot go H6805 (8799). Be not afraid H3372 (8799) of them; for they cannot do evil H7489 (8686), neither also [is it] in them to do good H3190 (8687).
010:006 Forasmuch as [there is] none like unto thee, O LORD H3068; thou [art] great H1419, and thy name H8034 [is] great H1419 in might H1369.
010:007 Who would not fear H3372 (8799) thee, O King H4428 of nations H1471? for to thee doth it appertain H2969 (8804): forasmuch as among all the wise H2450 [men] of the nations H1471, and in all their kingdoms H4438, [there is] none like unto thee.
010:008 But they are altogether H0259 brutish H1197 (8799) and foolish H3688 (8799): the stock H6086 [is] a doctrine H4148 of vanities H1892.
010:009 Silver H3701 spread into plates H7554 (8794) is brought H0935 (8714) from Tarshish H8659, and gold H2091 from Uphaz H0210, the work H4639 of the workman H2796, and of the hands H3027 of the founder H6884 (8802): blue H8504 and purple H0713 [is] their clothing H3830: they [are] all the work H4639 of cunning H2450 [men].
010:010 But the LORD H3068 [is] the true H0571 God H0430, he [is] the living H2416 God H0430, and an everlasting H5769 king H4428: at his wrath H7110 the earth H0776 shall tremble H7493 (8799), and the nations H1471 shall not be able to abide H3557 (8686) his indignation H2195.
010:011 Thus H1836 shall ye say H0560 (8748) unto them, The gods H0426 that have not H3809 made H5648 (8754) the heavens H8065 and the earth H0778, [even] they shall perish H0007 (8748) from the earth H0772, and from under H8460 these H0429 heavens H8065.
010:012 He hath made H6213 (8802) the earth H0776 by his power H3581, he hath established H3559 (8688) the world H8398 by his wisdom H2451, and hath stretched out H5186 (8804) the heavens H8064 by his discretion H8394.
010:013 When he uttereth H5414 (8800) his voice H6963, [there is] a multitude H1995 of waters H4325 in the heavens H8064, and he causeth the vapours H5387 to ascend H5927 (8686) from the ends H7097 of the earth H0776; he maketh H6213 (8804) lightnings H1300 with rain H4306, and bringeth forth H3318 (8686) the wind H7307 out of his treasures H0214.
010:014 Every man H0120 is brutish H1197 (8738) in [his] knowledge H1847: every founder H6884 (8802) is confounded H3001 (8689) by the graven image H6459: for his molten image H5262 [is] falsehood H8267, and [there is] no breath H7307 in them.
010:015 They [are] vanity H1892, [and] the work H4639 of errors H8595: in the time H6256 of their visitation H6486 they shall perish H0006 (8799).
010:016 The portion H2506 of Jacob H3290 [is] not like them: for he [is] the former H3335 (8802) of all [things]; and Israel H3478 [is] the rod H7626 of his inheritance H5159: The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] his name H8034.
010:017 Gather up H0622 (8798) thy wares H3666 out of the land H0776, O inhabitant H3427 (8802) of the fortress H4692.
010:018 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will sling H7049 (8802) out the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776 at this once H6471, and will distress H6887 (8689) them, that they may find H4672 (8799) [it so].
010:019 Woe H0188 is me for my hurt H7667! my wound H4347 is grievous H2470 (8737): but I said H0559 (8804), Truly H0389 this [is] a grief H2483, and I must bear H5375 (8799) it.
010:020 My tabernacle H0168 is spoiled H7703 (8795), and all my cords H4340 are broken H5423 (8738): my children H1121 are gone forth H3318 (8804) of me, and they [are] not: [there is] none to stretch forth H5186 (8802) my tent H0168 any more, and to set up H6965 (8688) my curtains H3407.
010:021 For the pastors H7462 (8802) are become brutish H1197 (8738), and have not sought H1875 (8804) the LORD H3068: therefore they shall not prosper H7919 (8689), and all their flocks H4830 shall be scattered H6327 (8738).
010:022 Behold, the noise H6963 of the bruit H8052 is come H0935 (8802), and a great H1419 commotion H7494 out of the north H6828 country H0776, to make H7760 (8800) the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 desolate H8077, [and] a den H4583 of dragons H8577.
010:023 O LORD H3068, I know H3045 (8804) that the way H1870 of man H0120 [is] not in himself: [it is] not in man H0376 that walketh H1980 (8802) to direct H3559 (8687) his steps H6806.
010:024 O LORD H3068, correct H3256 (8761) me, but with judgment H4941; not in thine anger H0639, lest thou bring me to nothing H4591 (8686).
010:025 Pour out H8210 (8798) thy fury H2534 upon the heathen H1471 that know H3045 (8804) thee not, and upon the families H4940 that call H7121 (8804) not on thy name H8034: for they have eaten up H0398 (8804) Jacob H3290, and devoured H0398 (8804) him, and consumed H3615 (8762) him, and have made his habitation H5116 desolate H8074 (8689).
011:001 ¶  The word H1697 that came to Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
011:002 Hear H8085 (8798) ye the words H1697 of this covenant H1285, and speak H1696 (8765) unto the men H0376 of Judah H3063, and to the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389;
011:003 And say H0559 (8804) thou unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478; Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] the man H0376 that obeyeth H8085 (8799) not the words H1697 of this covenant H1285,
011:004 Which I commanded H6680 (8765) your fathers H0001 in the day H3117 [that] I brought them forth H3318 (8687) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, from the iron H1270 furnace H3564, saying H0559 (8800), Obey H8085 (8798) my voice H6963, and do H6213 (8804) them, according to all which I command H6680 (8762) you: so shall ye be my people H5971, and I will be your God H0430:
011:005 That I may perform H6965 (8687) the oath H7621 which I have sworn H7650 (8738) unto your fathers H0001, to give H5414 (8800) them a land H0776 flowing H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706, as [it is] this day H3117. Then answered H6030 (8799) I, and said H0559 (8799), So be it H0543, O LORD H3068.
011:006 Then the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Proclaim H7121 (8798) all these words H1697 in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and in the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389, saying H0559 (8800), Hear H8085 (8798) ye the words H1697 of this covenant H1285, and do H6213 (8804) them.
011:007 For I earnestly H5749 (8687) protested H5749 (8689) unto your fathers H0001 in the day H3117 [that] I brought them up H5927 (8687) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, [even] unto this day H3117, rising early H7925 (8687) and protesting H5749 (8687), saying H0559 (8800), Obey H8085 (8798) my voice H6963.
011:008 Yet they obeyed H8085 (8804) not, nor inclined H5186 (8689) their ear H0241, but walked H3212 (8799) every one H0376 in the imagination H8307 of their evil H7451 heart H3820: therefore I will bring H0935 (8686) upon them all the words H1697 of this covenant H1285, which I commanded H6680 (8765) [them] to do H6213 (8800); but they did H6213 (8804) [them] not.
011:009 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, A conspiracy H7195 is found H4672 (8738) among the men H0376 of Judah H3063, and among the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389.
011:010 They are turned back H7725 (8804) to the iniquities H5771 of their forefathers H7223 H0001, which refused H3985 (8765) to hear H8085 (8800) my words H1697; and they went H1980 (8804) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430 to serve H5647 (8800) them: the house H1004 of Israel H3478 and the house H1004 of Judah H3063 have broken H6565 (8689) my covenant H1285 which I made H3772 (8804) with their fathers H0001.
011:011 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) evil H7451 upon them, which they shall not be able H3201 (8799) to escape H3318 (8800); and though they shall cry H2199 (8804) unto me, I will not hearken H8085 (8799) unto them.
011:012 Then shall the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 and inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 go H1980 (8804), and cry H2199 (8804) unto the gods H0430 unto whom they offer incense H6999 (8764): but they shall not save H3467 (8686) them at all H3467 (8687) in the time H6256 of their trouble H7451.
011:013 For [according to] the number H4557 of thy cities H5892 were thy gods H0430, O Judah H3063; and [according to] the number H4557 of the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389 have ye set up H7760 (8804) altars H4196 to [that] shameful thing H1322, [even] altars H4196 to burn incense H6999 (8763) unto Baal H1168.
011:014 Therefore pray H6419 (8691) not thou for this people H5971, neither lift up H5375 (8799) a cry H7440 or prayer H8605 for them: for I will not hear H8085 (8802) [them] in the time H6256 that they cry H7121 (8800) unto me for their trouble H7451.
011:015 What hath my beloved H3039 to do in mine house H1004, [seeing] she hath wrought H6213 (8800) lewdness H4209 with many H7227, and the holy H6944 flesh H1320 is passed H5674 (8799) from thee? when thou doest evil H7451, then thou rejoicest H5937 (8799).
011:016 The LORD H3068 called H7121 (8804) thy name H8034, A green H7488 olive tree H2132, fair H3303, [and] of goodly H8389 fruit H6529: with the noise H6963 of a great H1419 tumult H1999 he hath kindled H3341 (8689) fire H0784 upon it, and the branches H1808 of it are broken H7489 (8804).
011:017 For the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, that planted H5193 (8802) thee, hath pronounced H1696 (8765) evil H7451 against thee, for H1558 the evil H7451 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478 and of the house H1004 of Judah H3063, which they have done H6213 (8804) against themselves to provoke me to anger H3707 (8687) in offering incense H6999 (8763) unto Baal H1168.
011:018 And the LORD H3068 hath given me knowledge H3045 (8799) [of it], and I know H3045 (8689) [it]: then thou shewedst H7200 (8689) me their doings H4611.
011:019 But I [was] like a lamb H3532 [or] an ox H0441 [that] is brought H2986 (8714) to the slaughter H2873 (8800); and I knew H3045 (8804) not that they had devised H2803 (8804) devices H4284 against me, [saying], Let us destroy H7843 (8686) the tree H6086 with the fruit H3899 thereof, and let us cut him off H3772 (8799) from the land H0776 of the living H2416, that his name H8034 may be no more remembered H2142 (8735).
011:020 But, O LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, that judgest H8199 (8802) righteously H6664, that triest H0974 (8802) the reins H3629 and the heart H3820, let me see H7200 (8799) thy vengeance H5360 on them: for unto thee have I revealed H1540 (8765) my cause H7379.
011:021 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of the men H0582 of Anathoth H6068, that seek H1245 (8764) thy life H5315, saying H0559 (8800), Prophesy H5012 (8735) not in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, that thou die H4191 (8799) not by our hand H3027:
011:022 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, Behold, I will punish H6485 (8802) them: the young men H0970 shall die H4191 (8799) by the sword H2719; their sons H1121 and their daughters H1323 shall die H4191 (8799) by famine H7458:
011:023 And there shall be no remnant H7611 of them: for I will bring H0935 (8686) evil H7451 upon the men H0582 of Anathoth H6068, [even] the year H8141 of their visitation H6486.
012:001 ¶  Righteous H6662 [art] thou, O LORD H3068, when I plead H7378 (8799) with thee: yet let me talk H1696 (8762) with thee of [thy] judgments H4941: Wherefore doth the way H1870 of the wicked H7563 prosper H6743 (8804)? [wherefore] are all they happy H7951 (8804) that deal very H0899 treacherously H0898 (8802)?
012:002 Thou hast planted H5193 (8804) them, yea, they have taken root H8327 (8776): they grow H3212 (8799), yea, they bring forth H6213 (8804) fruit H6529: thou [art] near H7138 in their mouth H6310, and far from H7350 their reins H3629.
012:003 But thou, O LORD H3068, knowest H3045 (8804) me: thou hast seen H7200 (8799) me, and tried H0974 (8804) mine heart H3820 toward thee: pull them out H5423 (8685) like sheep H6629 for the slaughter H2878, and prepare H6942 (8685) them for the day H3117 of slaughter H2028.
012:004 How long shall the land H0776 mourn H0056 (8799), and the herbs H6212 of every field H7704 wither H3001 (8799), for the wickedness H7451 of them that dwell H3427 (8802) therein? the beasts H0929 are consumed H5595 (8804), and the birds H5775; because they said H0559 (8804), He shall not see H7200 (8799) our last end H0319.
012:005 If thou hast run H7323 (8804) with the footmen H7273, and they have wearied H3811 (8686) thee, then how canst thou contend H8474 (8807) with horses H5483? and [if] in the land H0776 of peace H7965, [wherein] thou trustedst H0982 (8802), [they wearied thee], then how wilt thou do H6213 (8799) in the swelling H1347 of Jordan H3383?
012:006 For even thy brethren H0251, and the house H1004 of thy father H0001, even they have dealt treacherously H0898 (8804) with thee; yea, they have called H7121 (8804) a multitude H4392 after H0310 thee: believe H0539 (8686) them not, though they speak H1696 (8762) fair words H2896 unto thee.
012:007 I have forsaken H5800 (8804) mine house H1004, I have left H5203 (8804) mine heritage H5159; I have given H5414 (8804) the dearly beloved H3033 of my soul H5315 into the hand H3709 of her enemies H0341 (8802).
012:008 Mine heritage H5159 is unto me as a lion H0738 in the forest H3293; it crieth out H5414 (8804) H6963 against me: therefore have I hated H8130 (8804) it.
012:009 Mine heritage H5159 [is] unto me [as] a speckled H6641 bird H5861, the birds H5861 round about H5439 [are] against her; come H3212 (8798) ye, assemble H0622 (8798) all the beasts H2416 of the field H7704, come H0857 (8685) to devour H0402.
012:010 Many H7227 pastors H7462 (8802) have destroyed H7843 (8765) my vineyard H3754, they have trodden H0947 my portion H2513 under foot H0947 (8790), they have made H5414 (8804) my pleasant H2532 portion H2513 a desolate H8077 wilderness H4057.
012:011 They have made H7760 (8804) it desolate H8076, [and being] desolate H8077 it mourneth H0056 (8804) unto me; the whole land H0776 is made desolate H8074 (8738), because no man H0376 layeth H7760 (8802) [it] to heart H3820.
012:012 The spoilers H7703 (8802) are come H0935 (8804) upon all high places H8205 through the wilderness H4057: for the sword H2719 of the LORD H3068 shall devour H0398 (8802) from the [one] end H7097 of the land H0776 even to the [other] end H7097 of the land H0776: no flesh H1320 shall have peace H7965.
012:013 They have sown H2232 (8804) wheat H2406, but shall reap H7114 (8804) thorns H6975: they have put themselves to pain H2470 (8738), [but] shall not profit H3276 (8686): and they shall be ashamed H0954 (8804) of your revenues H8393 because of the fierce H2740 anger H0639 of the LORD H3068.
012:014 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 against all mine evil H7451 neighbours H7934, that touch H5060 (8802) the inheritance H5159 which I have caused my people H5971 Israel H3478 to inherit H5157 (8689); Behold, I will pluck them out H5428 (8802) of their land H0127, and pluck out H5428 (8799) the house H1004 of Judah H3063 from among H8432 them.
012:015 And it shall come to pass, after H0310 that I have plucked them out H5428 (8800) I will return H7725 (8799), and have compassion H7355 (8765) on them, and will bring them again H7725 (8689), every man H0376 to his heritage H5159, and every man H0376 to his land H0776.
012:016 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently H3925 (8800) learn H3925 (8799) the ways H1870 of my people H5971, to swear H7650 (8736) by my name H8034, The LORD H3068 liveth H2416; as they taught H3925 (8765) my people H5971 to swear H7650 (8736) by Baal H1168; then shall they be built H1129 (8738) in the midst H8432 of my people H5971.
012:017 But if they will not obey H8085 (8799), I will utterly H5428 (8800) pluck up H5428 (8804) and destroy H0006 (8763) that nation H1471, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
013:001 ¶  Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 unto me, Go H1980 (8800) and get H7069 (8804) thee a linen H6593 girdle H0232, and put H7760 (8804) it upon thy loins H4975, and put H0935 (8686) it not in water H4325.
013:002 So I got H7069 (8799) a girdle H0232 according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, and put H7760 (8799) [it] on my loins H4975.
013:003 And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me the second time H8145, saying H0559 (8800),
013:004 Take H3947 (8798) the girdle H0232 that thou hast got H7069 (8804), which [is] upon thy loins H4975, and arise H6965 (8798), go H3212 (8798) to Euphrates H6578, and hide H2934 (8798) it there in a hole H5357 of the rock H5553.
013:005 So I went H3212 (8799), and hid H2934 (8799) it by Euphrates H6578, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) me.
013:006 And it came to pass after H7093 many H7227 days H3117, that the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Arise H6965 (8798), go H3212 (8798) to Euphrates H6578, and take H3947 (8798) the girdle H0232 from thence, which I commanded H6680 (8765) thee to hide H2934 (8800) there.
013:007 Then I went H3212 (8799) to Euphrates H6578, and digged H2658 (8799), and took H3947 (8799) the girdle H0232 from the place H4725 where I had hid H2934 (8804) it: and, behold, the girdle H0232 was marred H7843 (8738), it was profitable H6743 (8799) for nothing.
013:008 Then the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
013:009 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, After this manner will I mar H7843 (8686) the pride H1347 of Judah H3063, and the great H7227 pride H1347 of Jerusalem H3389.
013:010 This evil H7451 people H5971, which refuse H3987 to hear H8085 (8800) my words H1697, which walk H1980 (8802) in the imagination H8307 of their heart H3820, and walk H3212 (8799) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430, to serve H5647 (8800) them, and to worship H7812 (8692) them, shall even be as this girdle H0232, which is good H6743 (8799) for nothing.
013:011 For as the girdle H0232 cleaveth H1692 (8799) to the loins H4975 of a man H0376, so have I caused to cleave H1692 (8689) unto me the whole house H1004 of Israel H3478 and the whole house H1004 of Judah H3063, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; that they might be unto me for a people H5971, and for a name H8034, and for a praise H8416, and for a glory H8597: but they would not hear H8085 (8804).
013:012 Therefore thou shalt speak H0559 (8804) unto them this word H1697; Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, Every bottle H5035 shall be filled H4390 (8735) with wine H3196: and they shall say H0559 (8804) unto thee, Do we not certainly H3045 (8800) know H3045 (8799) that every bottle H5035 shall be filled H4390 (8735) with wine H3196?
013:013 Then shalt thou say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will fill H4390 (8764) all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of this land H0776, even the kings H4428 that sit H3427 (8802) upon David’s H1732 throne H3678, and the priests H3548, and the prophets H5030, and all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, with drunkenness H7943.
013:014 And I will dash H5310 (8765) them one H0376 against another H0251, even the fathers H0001 and the sons H1121 together H3162, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: I will not pity H2550 (8799), nor spare H2347 (8799), nor have mercy H7355 (8762), but destroy H7843 (8687) them.
013:015 Hear H8085 (8798) ye, and give ear H0238 (8685); be not proud H1361 (8799): for the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765).
013:016 Give H5414 (8798) glory H3519 to the LORD H3068 your God H0430, before he cause darkness H2821 (8686), and before your feet H7272 stumble H5062 (8691) upon the dark H5399 mountains H2022, and, while ye look H6960 (8765) for light H0216, he turn H7760 (8804) it into the shadow of death H6757, [and] make H7896 (8798) (8675) H7896 (8799) [it] gross darkness H6205.
013:017 But if ye will not hear H8085 (8799) it, my soul H5315 shall weep H1058 (8799) in secret places H4565 for H6440 [your] pride H1466; and mine eye H5869 shall weep H1830 (8799) sore H1830 (8800), and run down H3381 (8799) with tears H1832, because the LORD’S H3068 flock H5739 is carried away captive H7617 (8738).
013:018 Say H0559 (8798) unto the king H4428 and to the queen H1377, Humble H8213 (8685) yourselves, sit down H3427 (8798): for your principalities H4761 shall come down H3381 (8804), [even] the crown H5850 of your glory H8597.
013:019 The cities H5892 of the south H5045 shall be shut up H5462 (8795), and none shall open H6605 (8802) [them]: Judah H3063 shall be carried away captive H1540 (8717) all of it, it shall be wholly H7965 carried away captive H1540 (8717).
013:020 Lift up H5375 (8798) your eyes H5869, and behold H7200 (8798) them that come H0935 (8802) from the north H6828: where [is] the flock H5739 [that] was given H5414 (8738) thee, thy beautiful H8597 flock H6629?
013:021 What wilt thou say H0559 (8799) when he shall punish H6485 (8799) thee? for thou hast taught H3925 (8765) them [to be] captains H0441, [and] as chief H7218 over thee: shall not sorrows H2256 take H0270 (8799) thee, as a woman H0802 in travail H3205 (8800)?
013:022 And if thou say H0559 (8799) in thine heart H3824, Wherefore come H7122 (8804) these things upon me? For the greatness H7230 of thine iniquity H5771 are thy skirts H7757 discovered H1540 (8738), [and] thy heels H6119 made bare H2554 (8738).
013:023 Can the Ethiopian H3569 change H2015 (8799) his skin H5785, or the leopard H5246 his spots H2272? [then] may H3201 (8799) ye also do good H3190 (8687), that are accustomed H3928 to do evil H7489 (8687).
013:024 Therefore will I scatter H6327 (8686) them as the stubble H7179 that passeth away H5674 (8802) by the wind H7307 of the wilderness H4057.
013:025 This [is] thy lot H1486, the portion H4490 of thy measures H4055 from me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; because thou hast forgotten H7911 (8804) me, and trusted H0982 (8799) in falsehood H8267.
013:026 Therefore will I discover H2834 (8804) thy skirts H7757 upon thy face H6440, that thy shame H7036 may appear H7200 (8738).
013:027 I have seen H7200 (8804) thine adulteries H5004, and thy neighings H4684, the lewdness H2154 of thy whoredom H2184, [and] thine abominations H8251 on the hills H1389 in the fields H7704. Woe H0188 unto thee, O Jerusalem H3389! wilt thou not be made clean H2891 (8799)? when [shall it] once H5750 H0310 [be]?
014:001 ¶  The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 that came to Jeremiah H3414 concerning H1697 the dearth H1226.
014:002 Judah H3063 mourneth H0056 (8804), and the gates H8179 thereof languish H0535 (8797); they are black H6937 (8804) unto the ground H0776; and the cry H6682 of Jerusalem H3389 is gone up H5927 (8804).
014:003 And their nobles H0117 have sent H7971 (8804) their little ones H6810 to the waters H4325: they came H0935 (8804) to the pits H1356 (8676) H1360, [and] found H4672 (8804) no water H4325; they returned H7725 (8804) with their vessels H3627 empty H7387; they were ashamed H0954 (8804) and confounded H3637 (8717), and covered H2645 (8804) their heads H7218.
014:004 Because the ground H0127 is chapt H2865 (8804), for there was no rain H1653 in the earth H0776, the plowmen H0406 were ashamed H0954 (8804), they covered H2645 (8804) their heads H7218.
014:005 Yea, the hind H0365 also calved H3205 (8804) in the field H7704, and forsook H5800 (8800) [it], because there was no grass H1877.
014:006 And the wild asses H6501 did stand H5975 (8804) in the high places H8205, they snuffed up H7602 (8804) the wind H7307 like dragons H8577; their eyes H5869 did fail H3615 (8804), because [there was] no grass H6212.
014:007 O LORD H3068, though our iniquities H5771 testify H6030 (8804) against us, do H6213 (8798) thou [it] for thy name’s H8034 sake: for our backslidings H4878 are many H7231 (8804); we have sinned H2398 (8804) against thee.
014:008 O the hope H4723 of Israel H3478, the saviour H3467 (8688) thereof in time H6256 of trouble H6869, why shouldest thou be as a stranger H1616 in the land H0776, and as a wayfaring man H0732 (8802) [that] turneth aside H5186 (8804) to tarry for a night H3885 (8800)?
014:009 Why shouldest thou be as a man H0376 astonied H1724 (8737), as a mighty man H1368 [that] cannot H3201 (8799) save H3467 (8687)? yet thou, O LORD H3068, [art] in the midst H7130 of us, and we are called H7121 (8738) by thy name H8034; leave H3240 (8686) us not.
014:010 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 unto this people H5971, Thus have they loved H0157 (8804) to wander H5128 (8800), they have not refrained H2820 (8804) their feet H7272, therefore the LORD H3068 doth not accept H7521 (8804) them; he will now remember H2142 (8799) their iniquity H5771, and visit H6485 (8799) their sins H2403.
014:011 Then said H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068 unto me, Pray H6419 (8691) not for this people H5971 for [their] good H2896.
014:012 When they fast H6684 (8799), I will not hear H8085 (8802) their cry H7440; and when they offer H5927 (8686) burnt offering H5930 and an oblation H4503, I will not accept H7521 (8802) them: but I will consume H3615 (8764) them by the sword H2719, and by the famine H7458, and by the pestilence H1698.
014:013 Then said H0559 (8799) I, Ah H0162, Lord H0136 GOD H3069! behold, the prophets H5030 say H0559 (8802) unto them, Ye shall not see H7200 (8799) the sword H2719, neither shall ye have famine H7458; but I will give H5414 (8799) you assured H0571 peace H7965 in this place H4725.
014:014 Then the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, The prophets H5030 prophesy H5012 (8737) lies H8267 in my name H8034: I sent H7971 (8804) them not, neither have I commanded H6680 (8765) them, neither spake H1696 (8765) unto them: they prophesy H5012 (8693) unto you a false H8267 vision H2377 and divination H7081, and a thing of nought H0457 (8675) H0434, and the deceit H8649 of their heart H3820.
014:015 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 concerning the prophets H5030 that prophesy H5012 (8737) in my name H8034, and I sent H7971 (8804) them not, yet they say H0559 (8802), Sword H2719 and famine H7458 shall not be in this land H0776; By sword H2719 and famine H7458 shall those prophets H5030 be consumed H8552 (8735).
014:016 And the people H5971 to whom they prophesy H5012 (8737) shall be cast out H7993 (8716) in the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389 because H6440 of the famine H7458 and the sword H2719; and they shall have none to bury H6912 (8764) them H1992, them, their wives H0802, nor their sons H1121, nor their daughters H1323: for I will pour H8210 (8804) their wickedness H7451 upon them.
014:017 Therefore thou shalt say H0559 (8804) this word H1697 unto them; Let mine eyes H5869 run down H3381 (8799) with tears H1832 night H3915 and day H3119, and let them not cease H1820 (8799): for the virgin H1330 daughter H1323 of my people H5971 is broken H7665 (8738) with a great H1419 breach H7667, with a very H3966 grievous H2470 (8737) blow H4347.
014:018 If I go forth H3318 (8804) into the field H7704, then behold the slain H2491 with the sword H2719! and if I enter H0935 (8804) into the city H5892, then behold them that are sick H8463 with famine H7458! yea, both the prophet H5030 and the priest H3548 go about H5503 (8804) into a land H0776 that they know H3045 (8804) not.
014:019 Hast thou utterly H3988 (8800) rejected H3988 (8804) Judah H3063? hath thy soul H5315 lothed H1602 (8804) Zion H6726? why hast thou smitten H5221 (8689) us, and [there is] no healing H4832 for us? we looked H6960 (8763) for peace H7965, and [there is] no good H2896; and for the time H6256 of healing H4832, and behold trouble H1205!
014:020 We acknowledge H3045 (8804), O LORD H3068, our wickedness H7562, [and] the iniquity H5771 of our fathers H0001: for we have sinned H2398 (8804) against thee.
014:021 Do not abhor H5006 (8799) [us], for thy name’s H8034 sake, do not disgrace H5034 (8762) the throne H3678 of thy glory H3519: remember H2142 (8798), break H6565 (8686) not thy covenant H1285 with us.
014:022 Are there H3426 [any] among the vanities H1892 of the Gentiles H1471 that can cause rain H1652 (8688)? or can the heavens H8064 give H5414 (8799) showers H7241? [art] not thou he, O LORD H3068 our God H0430? therefore we will wait H6960 (8762) upon thee: for thou hast made H6213 (8804) all these [things].
015:001 ¶  Then said H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068 unto me, Though Moses H4872 and Samuel H8050 stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 me, [yet] my mind H5315 [could] not [be] toward this people H5971: cast [them] out H7971 (8761) of my sight H6440, and let them go forth H3318 (8799).
015:002 And it shall come to pass, if they say H0559 (8799) unto thee, Whither shall we go forth H3318 (8799)? then thou shalt tell H0559 (8804) them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Such as [are] for death H4194, to death H4194; and such as [are] for the sword H2719, to the sword H2719; and such as [are] for the famine H7458, to the famine H7458; and such as [are] for the captivity H7628, to the captivity H7628.
015:003 And I will appoint H6485 (8804) over them four H0702 kinds H4940, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: the sword H2719 to slay H2026 (8800), and the dogs H3611 to tear H5498 (8800), and the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064, and the beasts H0929 of the earth H0776, to devour H0398 (8800) and destroy H7843 (8687).
015:004 And I will cause H5414 (8804) them to be removed H2189 (8675) H2113 into all kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776, because H1558 of Manasseh H4519 the son H1121 of Hezekiah H3169 king H4428 of Judah H3063, for [that] which he did H6213 (8804) in Jerusalem H3389.
015:005 For who shall have pity H2550 (8799) upon thee, O Jerusalem H3389? or who shall bemoan H5110 (8799) thee? or who shall go aside H5493 (8799) to ask H7592 (8800) how thou doest H7965?
015:006 Thou hast forsaken H5203 (8804) me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, thou art gone H3212 (8799) backward H0268: therefore will I stretch out H5186 (8686) my hand H3027 against thee, and destroy H7843 (8686) thee; I am weary H3811 (8738) with repenting H5162 (8736).
015:007 And I will fan H2219 (8799) them with a fan H4214 in the gates H8179 of the land H0776; I will bereave H7921 (8765) [them] of children, I will destroy H0006 (8765) my people H5971, [since] they return H7725 (8804) not from their ways H1870.
015:008 Their widows H0490 are increased H6105 (8804) to me above the sand H2344 of the seas H3220: I have brought H0935 (8689) upon them against the mother H0517 of the young men H0970 a spoiler H7703 (8802) at noonday H6672: I have caused [him] to fall H5307 (8689) upon it suddenly H6597, and terrors H0928 upon the city H5892.
015:009 She that hath borne H3205 (8802) seven H7651 languisheth H0535 (8797): she hath given up H5301 (8804) the ghost H5315; her sun H8121 is gone H0935 (8804) down while [it was] yet day H3119 (8676) H3117: she hath been ashamed H0954 (8804) and confounded H2659 (8804): and the residue H7611 of them will I deliver H5414 (8799) to the sword H2719 before H6440 their enemies H0341 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
015:010 Woe H0188 is me, my mother H0517, that thou hast borne H3205 (8804) me a man H0376 of strife H7379 and a man H0376 of contention H4066 to the whole earth H0776! I have neither lent on usury H5383 (8804), nor men have lent to me on usury H5383 (8804); [yet] every one of them doth curse H7043 (8764) me.
015:011 The LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804), Verily H3808 H0518 it shall be well H2896 with thy remnant H8281 (8765) (8675) H8293; verily H0518 I will cause the enemy H0341 (8802) to entreat H6293 (8689) thee [well] in the time H6256 of evil H7451 and in the time H6256 of affliction H6869.
015:012 Shall iron H1270 break H7489 (8799) the northern H6828 iron H1270 and the steel H5178?
015:013 Thy substance H2428 and thy treasures H0214 will I give H5414 (8799) to the spoil H0957 without price H4242, and [that] for all thy sins H2403, even in all thy borders H1366.
015:014 And I will make [thee] to pass H5674 (8689) with thine enemies H0341 (8802) into a land H0776 [which] thou knowest H3045 (8804) not: for a fire H0784 is kindled H6919 (8804) in mine anger H0639, [which] shall burn H3344 (8714) upon you.
015:015 O LORD H3068, thou knowest H3045 (8804): remember H2142 (8798) me, and visit H6485 (8798) me, and revenge H5358 (8734) me of my persecutors H7291 (8802); take me not away H3947 (8799) in thy longsuffering H0639 H0750: know H3045 (8798) that for thy sake I have suffered H5375 (8800) rebuke H2781.
015:016 Thy words H1697 were found H4672 (8738), and I did eat H0398 (8799) them; and thy word H1697 was unto me the joy H8342 and rejoicing H8057 of mine heart H3824: for I am called H7121 (8738) by thy name H8034, O LORD H3068 God H0430 of hosts H6635.
015:017 I sat H3427 (8804) not in the assembly H5475 of the mockers H7832 (8764), nor rejoiced H5937 (8799); I sat H3427 (8804) alone H0910 because H6440 of thy hand H3027: for thou hast filled H4390 (8765) me with indignation H2195.
015:018 Why is my pain H3511 perpetual H5331, and my wound H4347 incurable H0605 (8803), [which] refuseth H3985 (8765) to be healed H7495 (8736)? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar H0391, [and as] waters H4325 [that] fail H0539 (8738)?
015:019 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, If thou return H7725 (8799), then will I bring thee again H7725 (8686), [and] thou shalt stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 me: and if thou take forth H3318 (8686) the precious H3368 from the vile H2151 (8802), thou shalt be as my mouth H6310: let them return H7725 (8799) unto thee; but return H7725 (8799) not thou unto them.
015:020 And I will make H5414 (8804) thee unto this people H5971 a fenced H1219 (8803) brasen H5178 wall H2346: and they shall fight H3898 (8738) against thee, but they shall not prevail H3201 (8799) against thee: for I [am] with thee to save H3467 (8687) thee and to deliver H5337 (8687) thee, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
015:021 And I will deliver H5337 (8689) thee out of the hand H3027 of the wicked H7451, and I will redeem H6299 (8804) thee out of the hand H3709 of the terrible H6184.
016:001 ¶  The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came also unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
016:002 Thou shalt not take H3947 (8799) thee a wife H0802, neither shalt thou have sons H1121 or daughters H1323 in this place H4725.
016:003 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 concerning the sons H1121 and concerning the daughters H1323 that are born H3205 (8688) in this place H4725, and concerning their mothers H0517 that bare H3205 (8802) them, and concerning their fathers H0001 that begat H3209 them in this land H0776;
016:004 They shall die H4191 (8799) of grievous H8463 deaths H4463; they shall not be lamented H5594 (8735); neither shall they be buried H6912 (8735); [but] they shall be as dung H1828 upon the face H6440 of the earth H0127: and they shall be consumed H3615 (8799) by the sword H2719, and by famine H7458; and their carcases H5038 shall be meat H3978 for the fowls H5775 of heaven H8064, and for the beasts H0929 of the earth H0776.
016:005 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Enter H0935 (8799) not into the house H1004 of mourning H4798, neither go H3212 (8799) to lament H5594 (8800) nor bemoan H5110 (8799) them: for I have taken away H0622 (8804) my peace H7965 from this people H5971, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, [even] lovingkindness H2617 and mercies H7356.
016:006 Both the great H1419 and the small H6996 shall die H4191 (8804) in this land H0776: they shall not be buried H6912 (8735), neither shall [men] lament H5594 (8799) for them, nor cut H1413 (8704) themselves, nor make themselves bald H7139 (8735) for them:
016:007 Neither shall [men] tear H6536 (8799) [themselves] for them in mourning H0060, to comfort H5162 (8763) them for the dead H4191 (8801); neither shall [men] give them the cup H3563 of consolation H8575 to drink H8248 (8686) for their father H0001 or for their mother H0517.
016:008 Thou shalt not also go H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of feasting H4960, to sit H3427 (8800) with them to eat H0398 (8800) and to drink H8354 (8800).
016:009 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will cause to cease H7673 (8688) out of this place H4725 in your eyes H5869, and in your days H3117, the voice H6963 of mirth H8342, and the voice H6963 of gladness H8057, the voice H6963 of the bridegroom H2860, and the voice H6963 of the bride H3618.
016:010 And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew H5046 (8686) this people H5971 all these words H1697, and they shall say H0559 (8804) unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD H3068 pronounced H1696 (8765) all this great H1419 evil H7451 against us? or what [is] our iniquity H5771? or what [is] our sin H2403 that we have committed H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068 our God H0430?
016:011 Then shalt thou say H0559 (8804) unto them, Because your fathers H0001 have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and have walked H3212 (8799) after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430, and have served H5647 (8799) them, and have worshipped H7812 (8691) them, and have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and have not kept H8104 (8804) my law H8451;
016:012 And ye have done H6213 (8800) worse H7489 (8689) than your fathers H0001; for, behold H2009, ye walk H1980 (8802) every one H0376 after H0310 the imagination H8307 of his evil H7451 heart H3820, that they may not hearken H8085 (8800) unto me:
016:013 Therefore will I cast H2904 (8689) you out of this land H0776 into a land H0776 that ye know H3045 (8804) not, [neither] ye nor your fathers H0001; and there shall ye serve H5647 (8804) other H0312 gods H0430 day H3119 and night H3915; where I will not shew H5414 (8799) you favour H2594.
016:014 Therefore, behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that it shall no more be said H0559 (8735), The LORD H3068 liveth H2416, that brought up H5927 (8689) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714;
016:015 But, The LORD H3068 liveth H2416, that brought up H5927 (8689) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 from the land H0776 of the north H6828, and from all the lands H0776 whither he had driven H5080 (8689) them: and I will bring them again H7725 (8689) into their land H0127 that I gave H5414 (8804) unto their fathers H0001.
016:016 Behold, I will send H7971 (8802) for many H7227 fishers H1771 (8675) H1728, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and they shall fish H1770 (8804) them; and after H0310 will I send H7971 (8799) for many H7227 hunters H6719, and they shall hunt H6679 (8804) them from every mountain H2022, and from every hill H1389, and out of the holes H5357 of the rocks H5553.
016:017 For mine eyes H5869 [are] upon all their ways H1870: they are not hid H5641 (8738) from my face H6440, neither is their iniquity H5771 hid H6845 (8738) from H5048 mine eyes H5869.
016:018 And first H7223 I will recompense H7999 (8765) their iniquity H5771 and their sin H2403 double H4932; because they have defiled H2490 (8763) my land H0776, they have filled H4390 (8804) mine inheritance H5159 with the carcases H5038 of their detestable H8251 and abominable things H8441.
016:019 O LORD H3068, my strength H5797, and my fortress H4581, and my refuge H4498 in the day H3117 of affliction H6869, the Gentiles H1471 shall come H0935 (8799) unto thee from the ends H0657 of the earth H0776, and shall say H0559 (8799), Surely our fathers H0001 have inherited H5157 (8804) lies H8267, vanity H1892, and [things] wherein [there is] no profit H3276 (8688).
016:020 Shall a man H0120 make H6213 (8799) gods H0430 unto himself, and they [are] no gods H0430?
016:021 Therefore, behold, I will this once H6471 cause them to know H3045 (8688), I will cause them to know H3045 (8686) mine hand H3027 and my might H1369; and they shall know H3045 (8804) that my name H8034 [is] The LORD H3068.
017:001 ¶  The sin H2403 of Judah H3063 [is] written H3789 (8803) with a pen H5842 of iron H1270, [and] with the point H6856 of a diamond H8068: [it is] graven H2790 (8803) upon the table H3871 of their heart H3820, and upon the horns H7161 of your altars H4196;
017:002 Whilst their children H1121 remember H2142 (8800) their altars H4196 and their groves H0842 by the green H7488 trees H6086 upon the high H1364 hills H1389.
017:003 O my mountain H2042 in the field H7704, I will give H5414 (8799) thy substance H2428 [and] all thy treasures H0214 to the spoil H0957, [and] thy high places H1116 for sin H2403, throughout all thy borders H1366.
017:004 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue H8058 (8804) from thine heritage H5159 that I gave H5414 (8804) thee; and I will cause thee to serve H5647 (8689) thine enemies H0341 (8802) in the land H0776 which thou knowest H3045 (8804) not: for ye have kindled H6919 (8804) a fire H0784 in mine anger H0639, [which] shall burn H3344 (8714) for H5704 ever H5769.
017:005 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] the man H1397 that trusteth H0982 (8799) in man H0120, and maketh H7760 (8804) flesh H1320 his arm H2220, and whose heart H3820 departeth H5493 (8799) from the LORD H3068.
017:006 For he shall be like the heath H6199 in the desert H6160, and shall not see H7200 (8799) when good H2896 cometh H0935 (8799); but shall inhabit H7931 (8804) the parched places H2788 in the wilderness H4057, [in] a salt H4420 land H0776 and not inhabited H3427 (8799).
017:007 Blessed H1288 (8803) [is] the man H1397 that trusteth H0982 (8799) in the LORD H3068, and whose hope H4009 the LORD H3068 is.
017:008 For he shall be as a tree H6086 planted H8362 (8803) by the waters H4325, and [that] spreadeth out H7971 (8762) her roots H8328 by the river H3105, and shall not see H7200 (8799) when heat H2527 cometh H0935 (8799), but her leaf H5929 shall be green H7488; and shall not be careful H1672 (8799) in the year H8141 of drought H1226, neither shall cease H4185 (8686) from yielding H6213 (8800) fruit H6529.
017:009 The heart H3820 [is] deceitful H6121 above all [things], and desperately wicked H0605 (8803): who can know H3045 (8799) it?
017:010 I the LORD H3068 search H2713 (8802) the heart H3820, [I] try H0974 (8802) the reins H3629, even to give H5414 (8800) every man H0376 according to his ways H1870, [and] according to the fruit H6529 of his doings H4611.
017:011 [As] the partridge H7124 sitteth H1716 (8804) [on eggs], and hatcheth H3205 (8804) [them] not; [so] he that getteth H6213 (8802) riches H6239, and not by right H4941, shall leave H5800 (8799) them in the midst H2677 of his days H3117, and at his end H0319 shall be a fool H5036.
017:012 A glorious H3519 high H4791 throne H3678 from the beginning H7223 [is] the place H4725 of our sanctuary H4720.
017:013 O LORD H3068, the hope H4723 of Israel H3478, all that forsake H5800 (8802) thee shall be ashamed H0954 (8799), [and] they that depart H3249 from me H5493 (8803) shall be written H3789 (8735) in the earth H0776, because they have forsaken H5800 (8804) the LORD H3068, the fountain H4726 of living H2416 waters H4325.
017:014 Heal H7495 (8798) me, O LORD H3068, and I shall be healed H7495 (8735); save H3467 (8685) me, and I shall be saved H3467 (8735): for thou [art] my praise H8416.
017:015 Behold, they say H0559 (8802) unto me, Where [is] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068? let it come H0935 (8799) now.
017:016 As for me, I have not hastened H0213 (8804) from [being] a pastor H7462 (8802) to follow H0310 thee: neither have I desired H0183 (8694) the woeful H0605 (8803) day H3117; thou knowest H3045 (8804): that which came out H4161 of my lips H8193 was [right] before H5227 thee H6440.
017:017 Be not a terror H4288 unto me: thou [art] my hope H4268 in the day H3117 of evil H7451.
017:018 Let them be confounded H0954 (8799) that persecute H7291 (8802) me, but let not me be confounded H0954 (8799): let them be dismayed H2865 (8735), but let not me be dismayed H2865 (8735): bring H0935 (8687) upon them the day H3117 of evil H7451, and destroy H7665 (8798) them with double H4932 destruction H7670.
017:019 Thus said H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 unto me; Go H1980 (8800) and stand H5975 (8804) in the gate H8179 of the children H1121 of the people H5971, whereby the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 come in H0935 (8799), and by the which they go out H3318 (8799), and in all the gates H8179 of Jerusalem H3389;
017:020 And say H0559 (8804) unto them, Hear H8085 (8798) ye the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, ye kings H4428 of Judah H3063, and all Judah H3063, and all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, that enter in H0935 (8802) by these gates H8179:
017:021 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Take heed H8104 (8734) to yourselves H5315, and bear H5375 (8799) no burden H4853 on the sabbath H7676 day H3117, nor bring H0935 (8689) [it] in by the gates H8179 of Jerusalem H3389;
017:022 Neither carry forth H3318 (8686) a burden H4853 out of your houses H1004 on the sabbath H7676 day H3117, neither do H6213 (8799) ye any work H4399, but hallow H6942 (8765) ye the sabbath H7676 day H3117, as I commanded H6680 (8765) your fathers H0001.
017:023 But they obeyed H8085 (8804) not, neither inclined H5186 (8689) their ear H0241, but made their neck H6203 stiff H7185 (8686), that they might not hear H8085 (8800), nor receive H3947 (8800) instruction H4148.
017:024 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently H8085 (8800) hearken H8085 (8799) unto me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, to bring H0935 (8687) in no burden H4853 through the gates H8179 of this city H5892 on the sabbath H7676 day H3117, but hallow H6942 (8763) the sabbath H7676 day H3117, to do H6213 (8800) no H1115 work H4399 therein;
017:025 Then shall there enter H0935 (8804) into the gates H8179 of this city H5892 kings H4428 and princes H8269 sitting H3427 (8802) upon the throne H3678 of David H1732, riding H7392 (8802) in chariots H7393 and on horses H5483, they, and their princes H8269, the men H0376 of Judah H3063, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389: and this city H5892 shall remain H3427 (8804) for ever H5769.
017:026 And they shall come H0935 (8804) from the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and from the places about H5439 Jerusalem H3389, and from the land H0776 of Benjamin H1144, and from the plain H8219, and from the mountains H2022, and from the south H5045, bringing H0935 (8688) burnt offerings H5930, and sacrifices H2077, and meat offerings H4503, and incense H3828, and bringing H0935 (8688) sacrifices of praise H8426, unto the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
017:027 But if ye will not hearken H8085 (8799) unto me to hallow H6942 (8763) the sabbath H7676 day H3117, and not to bear H5375 (8800) a burden H4853, even entering in H0935 (8800) at the gates H8179 of Jerusalem H3389 on the sabbath H7676 day H3117; then will I kindle H3341 (8689) a fire H0784 in the gates H8179 thereof, and it shall devour H0398 (8804) the palaces H0759 of Jerusalem H3389, and it shall not be quenched H3518 (8799).
018:001 ¶  The word H1697 which came to Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
018:002 Arise H6965 (8798), and go down H3381 (8804) to the potter’s H3335 (8802) house H1004, and there I will cause thee to hear H8085 (8686) my words H1697.
018:003 Then I went down H3381 (8799) to the potter’s H3335 (8802) house H1004, and, behold H2009, he wrought H6213 (8802) a work H4399 on the wheels H0070.
018:004 And the vessel H3627 that he made H6213 (8802) of clay H2563 was marred H7843 (8738) in the hand H3027 of the potter H3335 (8802): so he made H6213 (8799) it again H7725 (8804) another H0312 vessel H3627, as seemed H5869 good H3474 (8804) to the potter H3335 (8802) to make H6213 (8800) [it].
018:005 Then the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to me, saying H0559 (8800),
018:006 O house H1004 of Israel H3478, cannot H3201 (8799) I do H6213 (8800) with you as this potter H3335 (8802)? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068. Behold, as the clay H2563 [is] in the potter’s H3335 (8802) hand H3027, so [are] ye in mine hand H3027, O house H1004 of Israel H3478.
018:007 [At what] instant H7281 I shall speak H1696 (8762) concerning a nation H1471, and concerning a kingdom H4467, to pluck up H5428 (8800), and to pull down H5422 (8800), and to destroy H0006 (8687) [it];
018:008 If that nation H1471, against whom I have pronounced H1696 (8765), turn H7725 (8804) from their evil H7451, I will repent H5162 (8738) of the evil H7451 that I thought H2803 (8804) to do H6213 (8800) unto them.
018:009 And [at what] instant H7281 I shall speak H1696 (8762) concerning a nation H1471, and concerning a kingdom H4467, to build H1129 (8800) and to plant H5193 (8800) [it];
018:010 If it do H6213 (8804) evil H7451 in my sight H5869, that it obey H8085 (8800) not my voice H6963, then I will repent H5162 (8738) of the good H2896, wherewith I said H0559 (8804) I would benefit H3190 (8687) them.
018:011 Now therefore go to, speak H0559 (8798) to the men H0376 of Judah H3063, and to the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I frame H3335 (8802) evil H7451 against you, and devise H2803 (8802) a device H4284 against you: return H7725 (8798) ye now every one H0376 from his evil H7451 way H1870, and make your ways H1870 and your doings H4611 good H3190 (8685).
018:012 And they said H0559 (8804), There is no hope H2976 (8737): but we will walk H3212 (8799) after H0310 our own devices H4284, and we will every one H0376 do H6213 (8799) the imagination H8307 of his evil H7451 heart H3820.
018:013 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Ask H7592 (8798) ye now among the heathen H1471, who hath heard H8085 (8804) such things: the virgin H1330 of Israel H3478 hath done H6213 (8804) a very H3966 horrible thing H8186.
018:014 Will [a man] leave H5800 (8799) the snow H7950 of Lebanon H3844 [which cometh] from the rock H6697 of the field H7704? [or] shall the cold H7119 flowing H5140 (8802) waters H4325 that come from another place H2114 (8801) be forsaken H5428 (8735)?
018:015 Because my people H5971 hath forgotten H7911 (8804) me, they have burned incense H6999 (8762) to vanity H7723, and they have caused them to stumble H3782 (8686) in their ways H1870 [from] the ancient H5769 paths H7635 (8675) H7635, to walk H3212 (8800) in paths H5410, [in] a way H1870 not cast up H5549 (8803);
018:016 To make H7760 (8800) their land H0776 desolate H8047, [and] a perpetual H5769 hissing H8292 (8675) H8292; every one that passeth H5674 (8802) thereby shall be astonished H8074 (8799), and wag H5110 (8686) his head H7218.
018:017 I will scatter H6327 (8686) them as with an east H6921 wind H7307 before H6440 the enemy H0341 (8802); I will shew H7200 (8799) them the back H6203, and not the face H6440, in the day H3117 of their calamity H0343.
018:018 Then said H0559 (8799) they, Come H3212 (8798), and let us devise H2803 (8799) devices H4284 against Jeremiah H3414; for the law H8451 shall not perish H0006 (8799) from the priest H3548, nor counsel H6098 from the wise H2450, nor the word H1697 from the prophet H5030. Come H3212 (8798), and let us smite H5221 (8686) him with the tongue H3956, and let us not give heed H7181 (8686) to any of his words H1697.
018:019 Give heed H7181 (8685) to me, O LORD H3068, and hearken H8085 (8798) to the voice H6963 of them that contend H3401 with me.
018:020 Shall evil H7451 be recompensed H7999 (8792) for good H2896? for they have digged H3738 (8804) a pit H7745 for my soul H5315. Remember H2142 (8798) that I stood H5975 (8800) before H6440 thee to speak H1696 (8763) good H2896 for them, [and] to turn away H7725 (8687) thy wrath H2534 from them.
018:021 Therefore deliver up H5414 (8798) their children H1121 to the famine H7458, and pour out H5064 (8685) their [blood] by the force H3027 of the sword H2719; and let their wives H0802 be bereaved H7909 of their children, and [be] widows H0490; and let their men H0582 be put H2026 (8803) to death H4194; [let] their young men H0970 [be] slain H5221 (8716) by the sword H2719 in battle H4421.
018:022 Let a cry H2201 be heard H8085 (8735) from their houses H1004, when thou shalt bring H0935 (8686) a troop H1416 suddenly H6597 upon them: for they have digged H3738 (8804) a pit H7745 (8675) H7882 to take H3920 (8800) me, and hid H2934 (8804) snares H6341 for my feet H7272.
018:023 Yet, LORD H3068, thou knowest H3045 (8804) all their counsel H6098 against me to slay H4194 [me]: forgive H3722 (8762) not their iniquity H5771, neither blot out H4229 (8686) their sin H2403 from thy sight H6440, but let them be overthrown H3782 (8716) before H6440 thee; deal H6213 (8798) [thus] with them in the time H6256 of thine anger H0639.
019:001 ¶  Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Go H1980 (8800) and get H7069 (8804) a potter’s H3335 (8802) earthen H2789 bottle H1228, and [take] of the ancients H2205 of the people H5971, and of the ancients H2205 of the priests H3548;
019:002 And go forth H3318 (8804) unto the valley H1516 of the son H1121 of Hinnom H2011, which [is] by the entry H6607 of the east H2777 gate H8179, and proclaim H7121 (8804) there the words H1697 that I shall tell H1696 (8762) thee,
019:003 And say H0559 (8804), Hear H8085 (8798) ye the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, O kings H4428 of Judah H3063, and inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389; Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) evil H7451 upon this place H4725, the which whosoever heareth H8085 (8802), his ears H0241 shall tingle H6750 (8799).
019:004 Because they have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and have estranged H5234 (8762) this place H4725, and have burned incense H6999 (8762) in it unto other H0312 gods H0430, whom neither they nor their fathers H0001 have known H3045 (8804), nor the kings H4428 of Judah H3063, and have filled H4390 (8804) this place H4725 with the blood H1818 of innocents H5355;
019:005 They have built H1129 (8804) also the high places H1116 of Baal H1168, to burn H8313 (8800) their sons H1121 with fire H0784 [for] burnt offerings H5930 unto Baal H1168, which I commanded H6680 (8765) not, nor spake H1696 (8765) [it], neither came H5927 (8804) [it] into my mind H3820:
019:006 Therefore, behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that this place H4725 shall no more be called H7121 (8735) Tophet H8612, nor The valley H1516 of the son H1121 of Hinnom H2011, but The valley H1516 of slaughter H2028.
019:007 And I will make void H1238 (8804) the counsel H6098 of Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389 in this place H4725; and I will cause them to fall H5307 (8689) by the sword H2719 before H6440 their enemies H0341 (8802), and by the hands H3027 of them that seek H1245 (8764) their lives H5315: and their carcases H5038 will I give H5414 (8804) to be meat H3978 for the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064, and for the beasts H0929 of the earth H0776.
019:008 And I will make H7760 (8804) this city H5892 desolate H8047, and an hissing H8322; every one that passeth H5674 (8802) thereby shall be astonished H8074 (8799) and hiss H8319 (8799) because of all the plagues H4347 thereof.
019:009 And I will cause them to eat H0398 (8689) the flesh H1320 of their sons H1121 and the flesh H1320 of their daughters H1323, and they shall eat H0398 (8799) every one H0376 the flesh H1320 of his friend H7453 in the siege H4692 and straitness H4689, wherewith their enemies H0341 (8802), and they that seek H1245 (8764) their lives H5315, shall straiten H6693 (8686) them.
019:010 Then shalt thou break H7665 (8804) the bottle H1228 in the sight H5869 of the men H0582 that go H1980 (8802) with thee,
019:011 And shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; Even so H3602 will I break H7665 (8799) this people H5971 and this city H5892, as [one] breaketh H7665 (8799) a potter’s H3335 (8802) vessel H3627, that cannot H3201 (8799) be made whole again H7495 (8736): and they shall bury H6912 (8799) [them] in Tophet H8612, till [there be] no place H4725 to bury H6912 (8800).
019:012 Thus will I do H6213 (8799) unto this place H4725, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and to the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof, and [even] make H5414 (8800) this city H5892 as Tophet H8612:
019:013 And the houses H1004 of Jerusalem H3389, and the houses H1004 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063, shall be defiled H2931 as the place H4725 of Tophet H8612, because of all the houses H1004 upon whose roofs H1406 they have burned incense H6999 (8765) unto all the host H6635 of heaven H8064, and have poured out H5258 (8687) drink offerings H5262 unto other H0312 gods H0430.
019:014 Then came H0935 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 from Tophet H8612, whither the LORD H3068 had sent H7971 (8804) him to prophesy H5012 (8736); and he stood H5975 (8799) in the court H2691 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004; and said H0559 (8799) to all the people H5971,
019:015 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) upon this city H5892 and upon all her towns H5892 all the evil H7451 that I have pronounced H1696 (8765) against it, because they have hardened H7185 (8689) their necks H6203, that they might not hear H8085 (8800) my words H1697.
020:001 ¶  Now Pashur H6583 the son H1121 of Immer H0564 the priest H3548, who [was] also chief H6496 governor H5057 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, heard H8085 (8799) that Jeremiah H3414 prophesied H5012 (8738) these things H1697.
020:002 Then Pashur H6583 smote H5221 (8686) Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030, and put H5414 (8799) him in the stocks H4115 that [were] in the high H5945 gate H8179 of Benjamin H1144, which [was] by the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
020:003 And it came to pass on the morrow H4283, that Pashur H6583 brought forth H3318 (8686) Jeremiah H3414 out of the stocks H4115. Then said H0559 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 unto him, The LORD H3068 hath not called H7121 (8804) thy name H8034 Pashur H6583, but Magormissabib H4036.
020:004 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will make H5414 (8802) thee a terror H4032 to thyself, and to all thy friends H0157 (8802): and they shall fall H5307 (8804) by the sword H2719 of their enemies H0341 (8802), and thine eyes H5869 shall behold H7200 (8802) [it]: and I will give H5414 (8799) all Judah H3063 into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and he shall carry them captive H1540 (8689) into Babylon H0894, and shall slay H5221 (8689) them with the sword H2719.
020:005 Moreover I will deliver H5414 (8804) all the strength H2633 of this city H5892, and all the labours H3018 thereof, and all the precious things H3366 thereof, and all the treasures H0214 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 will I give H5414 (8799) into the hand H3027 of their enemies H0341 (8802), which shall spoil H0962 (8804) them, and take H3947 (8804) them, and carry H0935 (8689) them to Babylon H0894.
020:006 And thou, Pashur H6583, and all that dwell H3427 (8802) in thine house H1004 shall go H3212 (8799) into captivity H7628: and thou shalt come H0935 (8799) to Babylon H0894, and there thou shalt die H4191 (8799), and shalt be buried H6912 (8735) there, thou, and all thy friends H0157 (8802), to whom thou hast prophesied H5012 (8738) lies H8267.
020:007 O LORD H3068, thou hast deceived H6601 (8765) me, and I was deceived H6601 (8735): thou art stronger H2388 (8804) than I, and hast prevailed H3201 (8799): I am in derision H7814 daily H3117, every one mocketh H3932 (8802) me.
020:008 For since H1767 I spake H1696 (8762), I cried out H2199 (8799), I cried H7121 (8799) violence H2555 and spoil H7701; because the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 was made a reproach H2781 unto me, and a derision H7047, daily H3117.
020:009 Then I said H0559 (8804), I will not make mention H2142 (8799) of him, nor speak H1696 (8762) any more in his name H8034. But [his word] was in mine heart H3820 as a burning H1197 (8802) fire H0784 shut up H6113 (8803) in my bones H6106, and I was weary H3811 (8738) with forbearing H3557 (8771), and I could H3201 (8799) not [stay].
020:010 For I heard H8085 (8804) the defaming H1681 of many H7227, fear H4032 on every side H5439. Report H5046 (8685), [say they], and we will report H5046 (8686) it. All my familiars H0582 H7965 watched H8104 (8802) for my halting H6763 (8676) H6761, [saying], Peradventure he will be enticed H6601 (8792), and we shall prevail H3201 (8799) against him, and we shall take H3947 (8799) our revenge H5360 on him.
020:011 But the LORD H3068 [is] with me as a mighty H1368 terrible one H6184: therefore my persecutors H7291 (8802) shall stumble H3782 (8735), and they shall not prevail H3201 (8799): they shall be greatly H3966 ashamed H0954 (8804); for they shall not prosper H7919 (8689): [their] everlasting H5769 confusion H3639 shall never be forgotten H7911 (8735).
020:012 But, O LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, that triest H0974 (8802) the righteous H6662, [and] seest H7200 (8802) the reins H3629 and the heart H3820, let me see H7200 (8799) thy vengeance H5360 on them: for unto thee have I opened H1540 (8765) my cause H7379.
020:013 Sing H7891 (8798) unto the LORD H3068, praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3068: for he hath delivered H5337 (8689) the soul H5315 of the poor H0034 from the hand H3027 of evildoers H7489 (8688).
020:014 Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] the day H3117 wherein I was born H3205 (8795): let not the day H3117 wherein my mother H0517 bare H3205 (8804) me be blessed H1288 (8803).
020:015 Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] the man H0376 who brought tidings H1319 (8765) to my father H0001, saying H0559 (8800), A man H2145 child H1121 is born H3205 (8795) unto thee; making him very H8055 (8763) glad H8055 (8765).
020:016 And let that man H0376 be as the cities H5892 which the LORD H3068 overthrew H2015 (8804), and repented H5162 (8738) not: and let him hear H8085 (8804) the cry H2201 in the morning H1242, and the shouting H8643 at noontide H6256 H6672;
020:017 Because he slew H4191 (8790) me not from the womb H7358; or that my mother H0517 might have been my grave H6913, and her womb H7358 [to be] always H5769 great H2030 [with me].
020:018 Wherefore came I forth H3318 (8804) out of the womb H7358 to see H7200 (8800) labour H5999 and sorrow H3015, that my days H3117 should be consumed H3615 (8799) with shame H1322?
021:001 ¶  The word H1697 which came unto Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, when king H4428 Zedekiah H6667 sent H7971 (8800) unto him Pashur H6583 the son H1121 of Melchiah H4441, and Zephaniah H6846 the son H1121 of Maaseiah H4641 the priest H3548, saying H0559 (8800),
021:002 Enquire H1875 (8798), I pray thee, of the LORD H3068 for us H1157; for Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 maketh war H3898 (8737) against us; if so be that the LORD H3068 will deal H6213 (8799) with us according to all his wondrous works H6381 (8737), that he may go up H5927 (8799) from us.
021:003 Then said H0559 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 unto them, Thus shall ye say H0559 (8799) to Zedekiah H6667:
021:004 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will turn back H5437 (8688) the weapons H3627 of war H4421 that [are] in your hands H3027, wherewith ye fight H3898 (8737) against the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and [against] the Chaldeans H3778, which besiege H6696 (8802) you without H2351 the walls H2346, and I will assemble H0622 (8804) them into the midst H8432 of this city H5892.
021:005 And I myself will fight H3898 (8738) against you with an outstretched H5186 (8803) hand H3027 and with a strong H2389 arm H2220, even in anger H0639, and in fury H2534, and in great H1419 wrath H7110.
021:006 And I will smite H5221 (8689) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of this city H5892, both man H0120 and beast H0929: they shall die H4191 (8799) of a great H1419 pestilence H1698.
021:007 And afterward H0310, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, I will deliver H5414 (8799) Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063, and his servants H5650, and the people H5971, and such as are left H7604 (8737) in this city H5892 from the pestilence H1698, from the sword H2719, and from the famine H7458, into the hand H3027 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and into the hand H3027 of their enemies H0341 (8802), and into the hand H3027 of those that seek H1245 (8764) their life H5315: and he shall smite H5221 (8689) them with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719; he shall not spare H2347 (8799) them, neither have pity H2550 (8799), nor have mercy H7355 (8762).
021:008 And unto this people H5971 thou shalt say H0559 (8799), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I set H5414 (8802) before H6440 you the way H1870 of life H2416, and the way H1870 of death H4194.
021:009 He that abideth H3427 (8802) in this city H5892 shall die H4191 (8799) by the sword H2719, and by the famine H7458, and by the pestilence H1698: but he that goeth out H3318 (8802), and falleth H5307 (8804) to the Chaldeans H3778 that besiege H6696 (8802) you, he shall live H2421 (8804) (8675) H2421 (8799), and his life H5315 shall be unto him for a prey H7998.
021:010 For I have set H7760 (8804) my face H6440 against this city H5892 for evil H7451, and not for good H2896, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: it shall be given H5414 (8735) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and he shall burn H8313 (8804) it with fire H0784.
021:011 And touching the house H1004 of the king H4428 of Judah H3063, [say], Hear H8085 (8798) ye the word H1697 of the LORD H3068;
021:012 O house H1004 of David H1732, thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Execute H1777 (8798) judgment H4941 in the morning H1242, and deliver H5337 (8685) [him that is] spoiled H1497 (8803) out of the hand H3027 of the oppressor H6231 (8802), lest my fury H2534 go out H3318 (8799) like fire H0784, and burn H1197 (8804) that none can quench H3518 (8764) [it], because H6440 of the evil H7455 of your doings H4611.
021:013 Behold, I [am] against thee, O inhabitant H3427 (8802) of the valley H6010, [and] rock H6697 of the plain H4334, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; which say H0559 (8802), Who shall come down H5181 (8799) against us? or who shall enter H0935 (8799) into our habitations H4585?
021:014 But I will punish H6485 (8804) you according to the fruit H6529 of your doings H4611, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: and I will kindle H3341 (8689) a fire H0784 in the forest H3293 thereof, and it shall devour H0398 (8804) all things round about H5439 it.
022:001 ¶  Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Go down H3381 (8798) to the house H1004 of the king H4428 of Judah H3063, and speak H1696 (8765) there this word H1697,
022:002 And say H0559 (8804), Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, O king H4428 of Judah H3063, that sittest H3427 (8802) upon the throne H3678 of David H1732, thou, and thy servants H5650, and thy people H5971 that enter H0935 (8802) in by these gates H8179:
022:003 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Execute H6213 (8798) ye judgment H4941 and righteousness H6666, and deliver H5337 (8685) the spoiled H1497 (8803) out of the hand H3027 of the oppressor H6216: and do no wrong H3238 (8686), do no violence H2554 (8799) to the stranger H1616, the fatherless H3490, nor the widow H0490, neither shed H8210 (8799) innocent H5355 blood H1818 in this place H4725.
022:004 For if ye do H6213 (8799) this thing H1697 indeed H6213 (8800), then shall there enter in H0935 (8804) by the gates H8179 of this house H1004 kings H4428 sitting H3427 (8802) upon the throne H3678 of David H1732, riding H7392 (8802) in chariots H7393 and on horses H5483, he, and his servants H5650, and his people H5971.
022:005 But if ye will not hear H8085 (8799) these words H1697, I swear H7650 (8738) by myself, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that this house H1004 shall become a desolation H2723.
022:006 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 unto the king’s H4428 house H1004 of Judah H3063; Thou [art] Gilead H1568 unto me, [and] the head H7218 of Lebanon H3844: [yet] surely I will make H7896 (8799) thee a wilderness H4057, [and] cities H5892 [which] are not inhabited H3427 (8738) (8675) H3427 (8737).
022:007 And I will prepare H6942 (8765) destroyers H7843 (8688) against thee, every one H0376 with his weapons H3627: and they shall cut down H3772 (8804) thy choice H4005 cedars H0730, and cast H5307 (8689) [them] into the fire H0784.
022:008 And many H7227 nations H1471 shall pass H5674 (8804) by this city H5892, and they shall say H0559 (8804) every man H0376 to his neighbour H7453, Wherefore hath the LORD H3068 done H6213 (8804) thus unto this great H1419 city H5892?
022:009 Then they shall answer H0559 (8804), Because they have forsaken H5800 (8804) the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 their God H0430, and worshipped H7812 (8691) other H0312 gods H0430, and served H5647 (8799) them.
022:010 Weep H1058 (8799) ye not for the dead H4191 (8801), neither bemoan H5110 (8799) him: [but] weep H1058 (8798) sore H1058 (8800) for him that goeth away H1980 (8802): for he shall return H7725 (8799) no more, nor see H7200 (8804) his native H4138 country H0776.
022:011 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 touching H0413 Shallum H7967 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063, which reigned H4427 (8802) instead of Josiah H2977 his father H0001, which went forth H3318 (8804) out of this place H4725; He shall not return H7725 (8799) thither any more:
022:012 But he shall die H4191 (8799) in the place H4725 whither they have led him captive H1540 (8689), and shall see H7200 (8799) this land H0776 no more.
022:013 Woe H1945 unto him that buildeth H1129 (8802) his house H1004 by H3808 unrighteousness H6664, and his chambers H5944 by wrong H4941; [that] useth his neighbour’s H7453 service H5647 (8799) without wages H2600, and giveth H5414 (8799) him not for his work H6467;
022:014 That saith H0559 (8802), I will build H1129 (8799) me a wide H4060 house H1004 and large H7304 (8794) chambers H5944, and cutteth him out H7167 (8804) windows H2474; and [it is] cieled H5603 (8803) with cedar H0730, and painted H4886 (8800) with vermilion H8350.
022:015 Shalt thou reign H4427 (8799), because thou closest H8474 (8808) [thyself] in cedar H0730? did not thy father H0001 eat H0398 (8804) and drink H8354 (8804), and do H6213 (8804) judgment H4941 and justice H6666, [and] then [it was] well H2896 with him?
022:016 He judged H1777 (8804) the cause H1779 of the poor H6041 and needy H0034; then [it was] well H2896 [with him: was] not this to know H1847 me? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
022:017 But thine eyes H5869 and thine heart H3820 [are] not but for thy covetousness H1215, and for to shed H8210 (8800) innocent H5355 blood H1818, and for oppression H6233, and for violence H4835, to do H6213 (8800) [it].
022:018 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 concerning Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063; They shall not lament H5594 (8799) for him, [saying], Ah H1945 my brother H0251! or, Ah H1945 sister H0269! they shall not lament H5594 (8799) for him, [saying], Ah H1945 lord H0113! or, Ah H1945 his glory H1935!
022:019 He shall be buried H6912 (8735) with the burial H6900 of an ass H2543, drawn H5498 (8800) and cast forth H7993 (8687) beyond H1973 the gates H8179 of Jerusalem H3389.
022:020 Go up H5927 (8798) to Lebanon H3844, and cry H6817 (8798); and lift up H5414 (8798) thy voice H6963 in Bashan H1316, and cry H6817 (8798) from the passages H5676: for all thy lovers H0157 (8764) are destroyed H7665 (8738).
022:021 I spake H1696 (8765) unto thee in thy prosperity H7962; [but] thou saidst H0559 (8804), I will not hear H8085 (8799). This [hath been] thy manner H1870 from thy youth H5271, that thou obeyedst H8085 (8804) not my voice H6963.
022:022 The wind H7307 shall eat up H7462 (8799) all thy pastors H7462 (8802), and thy lovers H0157 (8764) shall go H3212 (8799) into captivity H7628: surely then shalt thou be ashamed H0954 (8799) and confounded H3637 (8738) for all thy wickedness H7451.
022:023 O inhabitant H3427 (8802) of Lebanon H3844, that makest thy nest H7077 (8794) in the cedars H0730, how gracious H2603 (8738) shalt thou be when pangs H2256 come H0935 (8800) upon thee, the pain H2427 as of a woman in travail H3205 (8802)!
022:024 [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, though Coniah H3659 the son H1121 of Jehoiakim H3079 king H4428 of Judah H3063 were the signet H2368 upon my right H3225 hand H3027, yet would I pluck H5423 (8799) thee thence;
022:025 And I will give H5414 (8804) thee into the hand H3027 of them that seek H1245 (8764) thy life H5315, and into the hand H3027 [of them] whose face H6440 thou fearest H3016 (8801), even into the hand H3027 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and into the hand H3027 of the Chaldeans H3778.
022:026 And I will cast thee out H2904 (8689), and thy mother H0517 that bare H3205 (8804) thee, into another H0312 country H0776, where ye were not born H3205 (8795); and there shall ye die H4191 (8799).
022:027 But to the land H0776 whereunto they desire H5375 (8764) (8676) H5315 to return H7725 (8800), thither shall they not return H7725 (8799).
022:028 [Is] this man H0376 Coniah H3659 a despised H0959 (8737) broken H5310 (8803) idol H6089? [is he] a vessel H3627 wherein [is] no pleasure H2656? wherefore are they cast out H7993 (8717), he and his seed H2233, and are cast H2904 (8717) into a land H0776 which they know H3045 (8804) not?
022:029 O earth H0776, earth H0776, earth H0776, hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
022:030 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Write H3789 (8798) ye this man H0376 childless H6185, a man H1397 [that] shall not prosper H6743 (8799) in his days H3117: for no man H0376 of his seed H2233 shall prosper H6743 (8799), sitting H3427 (8802) upon the throne H3678 of David H1732, and ruling H4910 (8802) any more in Judah H3063.
023:001 ¶  Woe H1945 be unto the pastors H7462 (8802) that destroy H0006 (8764) and scatter H6327 (8688) the sheep H6629 of my pasture H4830! saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
023:002 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 against the pastors H7462 (8802) that feed H7462 (8802) my people H5971; Ye have scattered H6327 (8689) my flock H6629, and driven them away H5080 (8686), and have not visited H6485 (8804) them: behold, I will visit H6485 (8802) upon you the evil H7455 of your doings H4611, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
023:003 And I will gather H6908 (8762) the remnant H7611 of my flock H6629 out of all countries H0776 whither I have driven H5080 (8689) them, and will bring them again H7725 (8689) to their folds H5116; and they shall be fruitful H6509 (8804) and increase H7235 (8804).
023:004 And I will set up H6965 (8689) shepherds H7462 (8802) over them which shall feed H7462 (8804) them: and they shall fear H3372 (8799) no more, nor be dismayed H2865 (8735), neither shall they be lacking H6485 (8735), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
023:005 Behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I will raise H6965 (8689) unto David H1732 a righteous H6662 Branch H6780, and a King H4428 shall reign H4427 (8804) and prosper H7919 (8689), and shall execute H6213 (8804) judgment H4941 and justice H6666 in the earth H0776.
023:006 In his days H3117 Judah H3063 shall be saved H3467 (8735), and Israel H3478 shall dwell H7931 (8799) safely H0983: and this [is] his name H8034 whereby he shall be called H7121 (8799), THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS H3072.
023:007 Therefore, behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that they shall no more say H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 liveth H2416, which brought up H5927 (8689) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714;
023:008 But, The LORD H3068 liveth H2416, which brought up H5927 (8689) and which led H0935 (8689) the seed H2233 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478 out of the north H6828 country H0776, and from all countries H0776 whither I had driven H5080 (8689) them; and they shall dwell H3427 (8804) in their own land H0127.
023:009 Mine heart H3820 within H7130 me is broken H7665 (8738) because of the prophets H5030; all my bones H6106 shake H7363 (8804); I am like a drunken H7910 man H0376, and like a man H1397 whom wine H3196 hath overcome H5674 (8804), because H6440 of the LORD H3068, and because of the words H1697 of his holiness H6944.
023:010 For the land H0776 is full H4390 (8804) of adulterers H5003 (8764); for because H6440 of swearing H0423 the land H0776 mourneth H0056 (8804); the pleasant places H4999 of the wilderness H4057 are dried up H3001 (8804), and their course H4794 is evil H7451, and their force H1369 [is] not right.
023:011 For both prophet H5030 and priest H3548 are profane H2610 (8804); yea, in my house H1004 have I found H4672 (8804) their wickedness H7451, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
023:012 Wherefore their way H1870 shall be unto them as slippery H2519 [ways] in the darkness H0653: they shall be driven on H1760 (8735), and fall H5307 (8804) therein: for I will bring H0935 (8686) evil H7451 upon them, [even] the year H8141 of their visitation H6486, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
023:013 And I have seen H7200 (8804) folly H8604 in the prophets H5030 of Samaria H8111; they prophesied H5012 (8694) in Baal H1168, and caused my people H5971 Israel H3478 to err H8582 (8686).
023:014 I have seen H7200 (8804) also in the prophets H5030 of Jerusalem H3389 an horrible thing H8186: they commit adultery H5003 (8800), and walk H1980 (8800) in lies H8267: they strengthen H2388 (8765) also the hands H3027 of evildoers H7489 (8688), that none H0376 doth return H7725 (8804) from his wickedness H7451: they are all of them unto me as Sodom H5467, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof as Gomorrah H6017.
023:015 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 concerning the prophets H5030; Behold, I will feed H0398 (8688) them with wormwood H3939, and make them drink H8248 (8689) the water H4325 of gall H7219: for from the prophets H5030 of Jerusalem H3389 is profaneness H2613 gone forth H3318 (8804) into all the land H0776.
023:016 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, Hearken H8085 (8799) not unto the words H1697 of the prophets H5030 that prophesy H5012 (8737) unto you: they make you vain H1891 (8688): they speak H1696 (8762) a vision H2377 of their own heart H3820, [and] not out of the mouth H6310 of the LORD H3068.
023:017 They say H0559 (8802) still H0559 (8800) unto them that despise H5006 (8764) me, The LORD H3068 hath said H1696 (8765), Ye shall have peace H7965; and they say H0559 (8804) unto every one that walketh H1980 (8802) after the imagination H8307 of his own heart H3820, No evil H7451 shall come H0935 (8799) upon you.
023:018 For who hath stood H5975 (8804) in the counsel H5475 of the LORD H3068, and hath perceived H7200 (8799) and heard H8085 (8799) his word H1697? who hath marked H7181 (8689) his word H1697, and heard H8085 (8799) [it]?
023:019 Behold, a whirlwind H5591 of the LORD H3068 is gone forth H3318 (8804) in fury H2534, even a grievous H2342 (8711) whirlwind H5591: it shall fall grievously H2342 (8799) upon the head H7218 of the wicked H7563.
023:020 The anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 shall not return H7725 (8799), until he have executed H6213 (8800), and till he have performed H6965 (8687) the thoughts H4209 of his heart H3820: in the latter H0319 days H3117 ye shall consider H0995 (8709) it perfectly H0998.
023:021 I have not sent H7971 (8804) these prophets H5030, yet they ran H7323 (8804): I have not spoken H1696 (8765) to them, yet they prophesied H5012 (8738).
023:022 But if they had stood H5975 (8804) in my counsel H5475, and had caused my people H5971 to hear H8085 (8686) my words H1697, then they should have turned H7725 (8686) them from their evil H7451 way H1870, and from the evil H7455 of their doings H4611.
023:023 [Am] I a God H0430 at hand H7138, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and not a God H0430 afar off H7350?
023:024 Can any H0376 hide H5641 (8735) himself in secret places H4565 that I shall not see H7200 (8799) him? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068. Do not I fill H4392 heaven H8064 and earth H0776? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
023:025 I have heard H8085 (8804) what the prophets H5030 said H0559 (8804), that prophesy H5012 (8737) lies H8267 in my name H8034, saying H0559 (8800), I have dreamed H2492 (8804), I have dreamed H2492 (8804).
023:026 How long shall [this] be H3426 in the heart H3820 of the prophets H5030 that prophesy H5012 (8737) lies H8267? yea, [they are] prophets H5030 of the deceit H8649 of their own heart H3820;
023:027 Which think H2803 (8802) to cause my people H5971 to forget H7911 (8687) my name H8034 by their dreams H2472 which they tell H5608 (8762) every man H0376 to his neighbour H7453, as their fathers H0001 have forgotten H7911 (8804) my name H8034 for Baal H1168.
023:028 The prophet H5030 that hath a dream H2472, let him tell H5608 (8762) a dream H2472; and he that hath my word H1697, let him speak H1696 (8762) my word H1697 faithfully H0571. What [is] the chaff H8401 to the wheat H1250? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
023:029 [Is] not my word H1697 like H3541 as a fire H0784? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; and like a hammer H6360 [that] breaketh H6327 the rock H5553 in pieces H6327 (8787)?
023:030 Therefore, behold, I [am] against the prophets H5030, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that steal H1589 (8764) my words H1697 every one H0376 from his neighbour H7453.
023:031 Behold, I [am] against the prophets H5030, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that use H3947 (8802) their tongues H3956, and say H5001 (8799), He saith H5002 (8803).
023:032 Behold, I [am] against them that prophesy H5012 (8737) false H8267 dreams H2472, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and do tell H5608 (8762) them, and cause my people H5971 to err H8582 (8686) by their lies H8267, and by their lightness H6350; yet I sent H7971 (8804) them not, nor commanded H6680 (8765) them: therefore they shall not profit H3276 (8686) this people H5971 at all H3276 (8687), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
023:033 And when this people H5971, or the prophet H5030, or a priest H3548, shall ask H7592 (8799) thee, saying H0559 (8800), What [is] the burden H4853 of the LORD H3068? thou shalt then say H0559 (8804) unto them, What burden H4853? I will even forsake H5203 (8804) you, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
023:034 And [as for] the prophet H5030, and the priest H3548, and the people H5971, that shall say H0559 (8799), The burden H4853 of the LORD H3068, I will even punish H6485 (8804) that man H0376 and his house H1004.
023:035 Thus shall ye say H0559 (8799) every one H0376 to his neighbour H7453, and every one H0376 to his brother H0251, What hath the LORD H3068 answered H6030 (8804)? and, What hath the LORD H3068 spoken H1696 (8765)?
023:036 And the burden H4853 of the LORD H3068 shall ye mention H2142 (8799) no more: for every man’s H0376 word H1697 shall be his burden H4853; for ye have perverted H2015 (8804) the words H1697 of the living H2416 God H0430, of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 our God H0430.
023:037 Thus shalt thou say H0559 (8799) to the prophet H5030, What hath the LORD H3068 answered H6030 (8804) thee? and, What hath the LORD H3068 spoken H1696 (8765)?
023:038 But H0518 since ye say H0559 (8799), The burden H4853 of the LORD H3068; therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Because ye say H0559 (8800) this word H1697, The burden H4853 of the LORD H3068, and I have sent H7971 (8799) unto you, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall not say H0559 (8799), The burden H4853 of the LORD H3068;
023:039 Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly H5377 (8800) forget H5382 (8804) you, and I will forsake H5203 (8804) you, and the city H5892 that I gave H5414 (8804) you and your fathers H0001, [and cast you] out of my presence H6440:
023:040 And I will bring H5414 (8804) an everlasting H5769 reproach H2781 upon you, and a perpetual H5769 shame H3640, which shall not be forgotten H7911 (8735).
024:001 ¶  The LORD H3068 shewed H7200 (8689) me, and, behold, two H8147 baskets H1736 of figs H8384 [were] set H3259 (8716) before H6440 the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068, after H0310 that Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 had carried away captive H1540 (8687) Jeconiah H3204 the son H1121 of Jehoiakim H3079 king H4428 of Judah H3063, and the princes H8269 of Judah H3063, with the carpenters H2796 and smiths H4525, from Jerusalem H3389, and had brought H0935 (8686) them to Babylon H0894.
024:002 One H0259 basket H1731 [had] very H3966 good H2896 figs H8384, [even] like the figs H8384 [that are] first ripe H1073: and the other H0259 basket H1731 [had] very H3966 naughty H7451 figs H8384, which could not be eaten H0398 (8735), they were so bad H7455.
024:003 Then said H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068 unto me, What seest H7200 (8802) thou, Jeremiah H3414? And I said H0559 (8799), Figs H8384; the good H2896 figs H8384, very H3966 good H2896; and the evil H7451, very H3966 evil H7451, that cannot be eaten H0398 (8735), they are so evil H7455.
024:004 Again the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
024:005 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Like these good H2896 figs H8384, so will I acknowledge H5234 (8686) them that are carried away captive H1546 of Judah H3063, whom I have sent H7971 (8765) out of this place H4725 into the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778 for [their] good H2896.
024:006 For I will set H7760 (8804) mine eyes H5869 upon them for good H2896, and I will bring them again H7725 (8689) to this land H0776: and I will build H1129 (8804) them, and not pull [them] down H2040 (8799); and I will plant H5193 (8804) them, and not pluck [them] up H5428 (8799).
024:007 And I will give H5414 (8804) them an heart H3820 to know H3045 (8800) me, that I [am] the LORD H3068: and they shall be my people H5971, and I will be their God H0430: for they shall return H7725 (8799) unto me with their whole heart H3820.
024:008 And as the evil H7451 figs H8384, which cannot be eaten H0398 (8735), they are so evil H7455; surely thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, So will I give H5414 (8799) Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 of Judah H3063, and his princes H8269, and the residue H7611 of Jerusalem H3389, that remain H7604 (8737) in this land H0776, and them that dwell H3427 (8802) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714:
024:009 And I will deliver H5414 (8804) them to be removed H2189 (8675) H2113 into all the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776 for [their] hurt H7451, [to be] a reproach H2781 and a proverb H4912, a taunt H8148 and a curse H7045, in all places H4725 whither I shall drive H5080 (8686) them.
024:010 And I will send H7971 (8765) the sword H2719, the famine H7458, and the pestilence H1698, among them, till they be consumed H8552 (8800) from off the land H0127 that I gave H5414 (8804) unto them and to their fathers H0001.
025:001 ¶  The word H1697 that came to Jeremiah H3414 concerning all the people H5971 of Judah H3063 in the fourth H7243 year H8141 of Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063, that [was] the first H7224 year H8141 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894;
025:002 The which Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 spake H1696 (8765) unto all the people H5971 of Judah H3063, and to all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, saying H0559 (8800),
025:003 From the thirteenth H7969 H6240 year H8141 of Josiah H2977 the son H1121 of Amon H0526 king H4428 of Judah H3063, even unto this day H3117, that [is] the three H7969 and twentieth H6242 year H8141, the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 hath come unto me, and I have spoken H1696 (8762) unto you, rising early H7925 (8687) and speaking H1696 (8763); but ye have not hearkened H8085 (8804).
025:004 And the LORD H3068 hath sent H7971 (8804) unto you all his servants H5650 the prophets H5030, rising early H7925 (8687) and sending H7971 (8800) [them]; but ye have not hearkened H8085 (8804), nor inclined H5186 (8689) your ear H0241 to hear H8085 (8800).
025:005 They said H0559 (8800), Turn ye again H7725 (8798) now every one H0376 from his evil H7451 way H1870, and from the evil H7455 of your doings H4611, and dwell H3427 (8798) in the land H0127 that the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8804) unto you and to your fathers H0001 for H5704 ever H5769 and ever H5769:
025:006 And go H3212 (8799) not after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430 to serve H5647 (8800) them, and to worship H7812 (8692) them, and provoke me not to anger H3707 (8686) with the works H4639 of your hands H3027; and I will do you no hurt H7489 (8686).
025:007 Yet ye have not hearkened H8085 (8804) unto me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; that ye might provoke me to anger H3707 (8687) with the works H4639 of your hands H3027 to your own hurt H7451.
025:008 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; Because ye have not heard H8085 (8804) my words H1697,
025:009 Behold, I will send H7971 (8802) and take H3947 (8804) all the families H4940 of the north H6828, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and Nebuchadrezzar H5019 the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, my servant H5650, and will bring H0935 (8689) them against this land H0776, and against the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof, and against all these nations H1471 round about H5439, and will utterly destroy H2763 (8689) them, and make H7760 (8804) them an astonishment H8047, and an hissing H8322, and perpetual H5769 desolations H2723.
025:010 Moreover I will take H0006 (8689) from them the voice H6963 of mirth H8342, and the voice H6963 of gladness H8057, the voice H6963 of the bridegroom H2860, and the voice H6963 of the bride H3618, the sound H6963 of the millstones H7347, and the light H0216 of the candle H5216.
025:011 And this whole land H0776 shall be a desolation H2723, [and] an astonishment H8047; and these nations H1471 shall serve H5647 (8804) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 seventy H7657 years H8141.
025:012 And it shall come to pass, when seventy H7657 years H8141 are accomplished H4390 (8800), [that] I will punish H6485 (8799) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and that nation H1471, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, for their iniquity H5771, and the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778, and will make H7760 (8804) it perpetual H5769 desolations H8077.
025:013 And I will bring H0935 (8689) upon that land H0776 all my words H1697 which I have pronounced H1696 (8765) against it, [even] all that is written H3789 (8803) in this book H5612, which Jeremiah H3414 hath prophesied H5012 (8738) against all the nations H1471.
025:014 For many H7227 nations H1471 and great H1419 kings H4428 shall serve H5647 (8804) themselves of them also: and I will recompense H7999 (8765) them according to their deeds H6467, and according to the works H4639 of their own hands H3027.
025:015 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 unto me; Take H3947 (8798) the wine H3196 cup H3563 of this fury H2534 at my hand H3027, and cause all the nations H1471, to whom I send H7971 (8802) thee, to drink H8248 (8689) it.
025:016 And they shall drink H8354 (8804), and be moved H1607 (8707), and be mad H1984 (8703), because H6440 of the sword H2719 that I will send H7971 (8802) among them.
025:017 Then took H3947 (8799) I the cup H3563 at the LORD’S H3068 hand H3027, and made all the nations H1471 to drink H8248 (8686), unto whom the LORD H3068 had sent H7971 (8804) me:
025:018 [To wit], Jerusalem H3389, and the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and the kings H4428 thereof, and the princes H8269 thereof, to make H5414 (8800) them a desolation H2723, an astonishment H8047, an hissing H8322, and a curse H7045; as [it is] this day H3117;
025:019 Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714, and his servants H5650, and his princes H8269, and all his people H5971;
025:020 And all the mingled H6153 people, and all the kings H4428 of the land H0776 of Uz H5780, and all the kings H4428 of the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430, and Ashkelon H0831, and Azzah H5804, and Ekron H6138, and the remnant H7611 of Ashdod H0795,
025:021 Edom H0123, and Moab H4124, and the children H1121 of Ammon H5983,
025:022 And all the kings H4428 of Tyrus H6865, and all the kings H4428 of Zidon H6721, and the kings H4428 of the isles H0339 which [are] beyond H5676 the sea H3220,
025:023 Dedan H1719, and Tema H8485, and Buz H0938, and all [that are] in the utmost H7112 (8803) corners H6285,
025:024 And all the kings H4428 of Arabia H6152, and all the kings H4428 of the mingled people H6153 that dwell H7931 (8802) in the desert H4057,
025:025 And all the kings H4428 of Zimri H2174, and all the kings H4428 of Elam H5867, and all the kings H4428 of the Medes H4074,
025:026 And all the kings H4428 of the north H6828, far H7350 and near H7138, one H0376 with another H0251, and all the kingdoms H4467 of the world H0776, which [are] upon the face H6440 of the earth H0127: and the king H4428 of Sheshach H8347 shall drink H8354 (8799) after H0310 them.
025:027 Therefore thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Drink H8354 (8798) ye, and be drunken H7937 (8798), and spue H7006 (8798), and fall H5307 (8798), and rise H6965 (8799) no more, because H6440 of the sword H2719 which I will send H7971 (8802) among you.
025:028 And it shall be, if they refuse H3985 (8762) to take H3947 (8800) the cup H3563 at thine hand H3027 to drink H8354 (8800), then shalt thou say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; Ye shall certainly H8354 (8800) drink H8354 (8799).
025:029 For, lo, I begin H2490 (8688) to bring evil H7489 (8687) on the city H5892 which is called H7121 (8738) by my name H8034, and should ye be utterly H5352 (8736) unpunished H5352 (8735)? Ye shall not be unpunished H5352 (8736): for I will call H7121 (8802) for a sword H2719 upon all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the earth H0776, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
025:030 Therefore prophesy H5012 (8735) thou against them all these words H1697, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, The LORD H3068 shall roar H7580 (8799) from on high H4791, and utter H5414 (8799) his voice H6963 from his holy H6944 habitation H4583; he shall mightily H7580 (8800) roar H7580 (8799) upon his habitation H5116; he shall give H6030 (8799) a shout H1959, as they that tread H1869 (8802) [the grapes], against all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the earth H0776.
025:031 A noise H7588 shall come H0935 (8804) [even] to the ends H7097 of the earth H0776; for the LORD H3068 hath a controversy H7379 with the nations H1471, he will plead H8199 (8737) with all flesh H1320; he will give H5414 (8804) them [that are] wicked H7563 to the sword H2719, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
025:032 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, Behold, evil H7451 shall go forth H3318 (8802) from nation H1471 to nation H1471, and a great H1419 whirlwind H5591 shall be raised up H5782 (8735) from the coasts H3411 of the earth H0776.
025:033 And the slain H2491 of the LORD H3068 shall be at that day H3117 from [one] end H7097 of the earth H0776 even unto the [other] end H7097 of the earth H0776: they shall not be lamented H5594 (8735), neither gathered H0622 (8735), nor buried H6912 (8735); they shall be dung H1828 upon H6440 the ground H0127.
025:034 Howl H3213 (8685), ye shepherds H7462 (8802), and cry H2199 (8798); and wallow H6428 (8690) yourselves [in the ashes], ye principal H0117 of the flock H6629: for the days H3117 of your slaughter H2873 (8800) and of your dispersions H8600 are accomplished H4390 (8804); and ye shall fall H5307 (8804) like a pleasant H2532 vessel H3627.
025:035 And the shepherds H7462 (8802) shall have no way H4498 to flee H0006 (8804), nor the principal H0117 of the flock H6629 to escape H6413.
025:036 A voice H6963 of the cry H6818 of the shepherds H7462 (8802), and an howling H3215 of the principal H0117 of the flock H6629, [shall be heard]: for the LORD H3068 hath spoiled H7703 (8802) their pasture H4830.
025:037 And the peaceable H7965 habitations H4999 are cut down H1826 (8738) because H6440 of the fierce H2740 anger H0639 of the LORD H3068.
025:038 He hath forsaken H5800 (8804) his covert H5520, as the lion H3715: for their land H0776 is desolate H8047 because H6440 of the fierceness H2740 of the oppressor H3238 (8802), and because H6440 of his fierce H2740 anger H0639.
026:001 ¶  In the beginning H7225 of the reign H4468 of Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063 came this word H1697 from the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
026:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Stand H5975 (8798) in the court H2691 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004, and speak H1696 (8765) unto all the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, which come H0935 (8802) to worship H7812 (8692) in the LORD’S H3068 house H1004, all the words H1697 that I command H6680 (8765) thee to speak H1696 (8763) unto them; diminish H1639 (8799) not a word H1697:
026:003 If so be they will hearken H8085 (8799), and turn H7725 (8799) every man H0376 from his evil H7451 way H1870, that I may repent H5162 (8738) me of the evil H7451, which I purpose H2803 (8802) to do H6213 (8800) unto them because H6440 of the evil H7455 of their doings H4611.
026:004 And thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; If ye will not hearken H8085 (8799) to me, to walk H3212 (8800) in my law H8451, which I have set H5414 (8804) before H6440 you,
026:005 To hearken H8085 (8800) to the words H1697 of my servants H5650 the prophets H5030, whom I sent H7971 (8802) unto you, both rising up early H7925 (8687), and sending H7971 (8800) [them], but ye have not hearkened H8085 (8804);
026:006 Then will I make H5414 (8804) this house H1004 like Shiloh H7887, and will make H5414 (8799) this city H5892 a curse H7045 to all the nations H1471 of the earth H0776.
026:007 So the priests H3548 and the prophets H5030 and all the people H5971 heard H8085 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 speaking H1696 (8764) these words H1697 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
026:008 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah H3414 had made an end H3615 (8763) of speaking H1696 (8763) all that the LORD H3068 had commanded H6680 (8765) [him] to speak H1696 (8763) unto all the people H5971, that the priests H3548 and the prophets H5030 and all the people H5971 took H8610 (8799) him, saying H0559 (8800), Thou shalt surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799).
026:009 Why hast thou prophesied H5012 (8738) in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), This house H1004 shall be like Shiloh H7887, and this city H5892 shall be desolate H2717 (8799) without an inhabitant H3427 (8802)? And all the people H5971 were gathered H6950 (8735) against Jeremiah H3414 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
026:010 When the princes H8269 of Judah H3063 heard H8085 (8799) these things H1697, then they came up H5927 (8799) from the king’s H4428 house H1004 unto the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and sat down H3427 (8799) in the entry H6607 of the new H2319 gate H8179 of the LORD’S H3068 [house].
026:011 Then spake H0559 (8799) the priests H3548 and the prophets H5030 unto the princes H8269 and to all the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), This man H0376 [is] worthy H4941 to die H4194; for he hath prophesied H5012 (8738) against this city H5892, as ye have heard H8085 (8804) with your ears H0241.
026:012 Then spake H0559 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 unto all the princes H8269 and to all the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8804) me to prophesy H5012 (8736) against this house H1004 and against this city H5892 all the words H1697 that ye have heard H8085 (8804).
026:013 Therefore now amend H3190 (8685) your ways H1870 and your doings H4611, and obey H8085 (8798) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430; and the LORD H3068 will repent H5162 (8735) him of the evil H7451 that he hath pronounced H1696 (8765) against you.
026:014 As for me, behold, I [am] in your hand H3027: do H6213 (8798) with me as seemeth H5869 good H2896 and meet H3477 unto you.
026:015 But know H3045 (8799) ye for certain H3045 (8800), that if ye put me to death H4191 (8688), ye shall surely bring H5414 (8802) innocent H5355 blood H1818 upon yourselves, and upon this city H5892, and upon the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof: for of a truth H0571 the LORD H3068 hath sent H7971 (8804) me unto you to speak H1696 (8763) all these words H1697 in your ears H0241.
026:016 Then said H0559 (8799) the princes H8269 and all the people H5971 unto the priests H3548 and to the prophets H5030; This man H0376 [is] not worthy H4941 to die H4194: for he hath spoken H1696 (8765) to us in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430.
026:017 Then rose up H6965 (8799) certain H0582 of the elders H2205 of the land H0776, and spake H0559 (8799) to all the assembly H6951 of the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800),
026:018 Micah H4320 the Morasthite H4183 prophesied H5012 (8737) in the days H3117 of Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063, and spake H0559 (8799) to all the people H5971 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; Zion H6726 shall be plowed H2790 (8735) [like] a field H7704, and Jerusalem H3389 shall become heaps H5856, and the mountain H2022 of the house H1004 as the high places H1116 of a forest H3293.
026:019 Did Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063 and all Judah H3063 put him at all H4191 (8687) to death H4191 (8689)? did he not fear H3373 the LORD H3068, and besought H2470 (8762) the LORD H3068 H6440, and the LORD H3068 repented H5162 (8735) him of the evil H7451 which he had pronounced H1696 (8765) against them? Thus H0587 might we procure H6213 (8802) great H1419 evil H7451 against our souls H5315.
026:020 And there was also a man H0376 that prophesied H5012 (8693) in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, Urijah H0223 the son H1121 of Shemaiah H8098 of Kirjathjearim H7157, who prophesied H5012 (8735) against this city H5892 and against this land H0776 according to all the words H1697 of Jeremiah H3414:
026:021 And when Jehoiakim H3079 the king H4428, with all his mighty men H1368, and all the princes H8269, heard H8085 (8799) his words H1697, the king H4428 sought H1245 (8762) to put him to death H4191 (8687): but when Urijah H0223 heard H8085 (8799) it, he was afraid H3372 (8799), and fled H1272 (8799), and went H0935 (8799) into Egypt H4714;
026:022 And Jehoiakim H3079 the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799) men H0582 into Egypt H4714, [namely], Elnathan H0494 the son H1121 of Achbor H5907, and [certain] men H0582 with him into Egypt H4714.
026:023 And they fetched forth H3318 (8686) Urijah H0223 out of Egypt H4714, and brought H0935 (8686) him unto Jehoiakim H3079 the king H4428; who slew H5221 (8686) him with the sword H2719, and cast H7993 (8686) his dead body H5038 into the graves H6913 of the common H1121 people H5971.
026:024 Nevertheless the hand H3027 of Ahikam H0296 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227 was with Jeremiah H3414, that they should not give H5414 (8800) him into the hand H3027 of the people H5971 to put him to death H4191 (8687).
027:001 ¶  In the beginning H7225 of the reign H4467 of Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063 came this word H1697 unto Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
027:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 to me; Make H6213 (8798) thee bonds H4147 and yokes H4133, and put H5414 (8804) them upon thy neck H6677,
027:003 And send H7971 (8765) them to the king H4428 of Edom H0123, and to the king H4428 of Moab H4124, and to the king H4428 of the Ammonites H1121 H5983, and to the king H4428 of Tyrus H6865, and to the king H4428 of Zidon H6721, by the hand H3027 of the messengers H4397 which come H0935 (8802) to Jerusalem H3389 unto Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063;
027:004 And command H6680 (8765) them to say H0559 (8800) unto their masters H0113, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Thus shall ye say H0559 (8799) unto your masters H0113;
027:005 I have made H6213 (8804) the earth H0776, the man H0120 and the beast H0929 that [are] upon H6440 the ground H0776, by my great H1419 power H3581 and by my outstretched H5186 (8803) arm H2220, and have given H5414 (8804) it unto whom it seemed H5869 meet H3474 (8804) unto me.
027:006 And now have I given H5414 (8804) all these lands H0776 into the hand H3027 of Nebuchadnezzar H5019 the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, my servant H5650; and the beasts H2416 of the field H7704 have I given H5414 (8804) him also to serve H5647 (8800) him.
027:007 And all nations H1471 shall serve H5647 (8804) him, and his son H1121, and his son’s H1121 son H1121, until the very time H6256 of his land H0776 come H0935 (8800): and then many H7227 nations H1471 and great H1419 kings H4428 shall serve H5647 (8804) themselves of him.
027:008 And it shall come to pass, [that] the nation H1471 and kingdom H4467 which will not serve H5647 (8799) the same Nebuchadnezzar H5019 the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and that will not put H5414 (8799) their neck H6677 under the yoke H5923 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, that nation H1471 will I punish H6485 (8799), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, with the sword H2719, and with the famine H7458, and with the pestilence H1698, until I have consumed H8552 (8800) them by his hand H3027.
027:009 Therefore hearken H8085 (8799) not ye to your prophets H5030, nor to your diviners H7080 (8802), nor to your dreamers H2472, nor to your enchanters H6049 (8781), nor to your sorcerers H3786, which speak H0559 (8802) unto you, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall not serve H5647 (8799) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894:
027:010 For they prophesy H5012 (8737) a lie H8267 unto you, to remove you far H7368 (8687) from your land H0127; and that I should drive you out H5080 (8689), and ye should perish H0006 (8804).
027:011 But the nations H1471 that bring H0935 (8686) their neck H6677 under the yoke H5923 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and serve H5647 (8804) him, those will I let remain still H3240 (8689) in their own land H0127, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; and they shall till H5647 (8804) it, and dwell H3427 (8804) therein.
027:012 I spake H1696 (8765) also to Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063 according to all these words H1697, saying H0559 (8800), Bring H0935 (8685) your necks H6677 under the yoke H5923 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and serve H5647 (8798) him and his people H5971, and live H2421 (8798).
027:013 Why will ye die H4191 (8799), thou and thy people H5971, by the sword H2719, by the famine H7458, and by the pestilence H1698, as the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) against the nation H1471 that will not serve H5647 (8799) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894?
027:014 Therefore hearken H8085 (8799) not unto the words H1697 of the prophets H5030 that speak H0559 (8802) unto you, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall not serve H5647 (8799) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894: for they prophesy H5012 (8737) a lie H8267 unto you.
027:015 For I have not sent H7971 (8804) them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, yet they prophesy H5012 (8737) a lie H8267 in my name H8034; that I might drive you out H5080 (8687), and that ye might perish H0006 (8804), ye, and the prophets H5030 that prophesy H5012 (8737) unto you.
027:016 Also I spake H1696 (8765) to the priests H3548 and to all this people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Hearken H8085 (8799) not to the words H1697 of your prophets H5030 that prophesy H5012 (8737) unto you, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, the vessels H3627 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004 shall now shortly H4120 be brought again H7725 (8716) from Babylon H0894: for they prophesy H5012 (8737) a lie H8267 unto you.
027:017 Hearken H8085 (8799) not unto them; serve H5647 (8798) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and live H2421 (8798): wherefore should this city H5892 be laid waste H2723?
027:018 But if they [be] prophets H5030, and if the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 be H3426 with them, let them now make intercession H6293 (8799) to the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, that the vessels H3627 which are left H3498 (8737) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and [in] the house H1004 of the king H4428 of Judah H3063, and at Jerusalem H3389, go H0935 (8804) not to Babylon H0894.
027:019 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 concerning the pillars H5982, and concerning the sea H3220, and concerning the bases H4350, and concerning the residue H3499 of the vessels H3627 that remain H3498 (8737) in this city H5892,
027:020 Which Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 took H3947 (8804) not, when he carried away captive H1540 (8687) Jeconiah H3204 the son H1121 of Jehoiakim H3079 king H4428 of Judah H3063 from Jerusalem H3389 to Babylon H0894, and all the nobles H2715 of Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389;
027:021 Yea, thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, concerning the vessels H3627 that remain H3498 (8737) [in] the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and [in] the house H1004 of the king H4428 of Judah H3063 and of Jerusalem H3389;
027:022 They shall be carried H0935 (8714) to Babylon H0894, and there shall they be until the day H3117 that I visit H6485 (8800) them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; then will I bring H5927 (8689) them up, and restore H7725 (8689) them to this place H4725.
028:001 ¶  And it came to pass the same year H8141, in the beginning H7225 of the reign H4467 of Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063, in the fourth H7243 year H8141, [and] in the fifth H2549 month H2320, [that] Hananiah H2608 the son H1121 of Azur H5809 the prophet H5030, which [was] of Gibeon H1391, spake H0559 (8804) unto me in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, in the presence H5869 of the priests H3548 and of all the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800),
028:002 Thus speaketh H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), I have broken H7665 (8804) the yoke H5923 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894.
028:003 Within two full H3117 years H8141 will I bring again H7725 (8688) into this place H4725 all the vessels H3627 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004, that Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 took away H3947 (8804) from this place H4725, and carried H0935 (8686) them to Babylon H0894:
028:004 And I will bring again H7725 (8688) to this place H4725 Jeconiah H3204 the son H1121 of Jehoiakim H3079 king H4428 of Judah H3063, with all the captives H1546 of Judah H3063, that went H0935 (8802) into Babylon H0894, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: for I will break H7665 (8799) the yoke H5923 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894.
028:005 Then the prophet H5030 Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799) unto the prophet H5030 Hananiah H2608 in the presence H5869 of the priests H3548, and in the presence H5869 of all the people H5971 that stood H5975 (8802) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068,
028:006 Even the prophet H5030 Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799), Amen H0543: the LORD H3068 do H6213 (8799) so: the LORD H3068 perform H6965 (8686) thy words H1697 which thou hast prophesied H5012 (8738), to bring again H7725 (8687) the vessels H3627 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004, and all that is carried away captive H1473, from Babylon H0894 into this place H4725.
028:007 Nevertheless hear H8085 (8798) thou now this word H1697 that I speak H1696 (8802) in thine ears H0241, and in the ears H0241 of all the people H5971;
028:008 The prophets H5030 that have been before H6440 me and before H6440 thee of old H5769 prophesied H5012 (8735) both against many H7227 countries H0776, and against great H1419 kingdoms H4467, of war H4421, and of evil H7451, and of pestilence H1698.
028:009 The prophet H5030 which prophesieth H5012 (8735) of peace H7965, when the word H1697 of the prophet H5030 shall come to pass H0935 (8800), [then] H0227 shall the prophet H5030 be known H3045 (8735), that the LORD H3068 hath truly H0571 sent H7971 (8804) him.
028:010 Then Hananiah H2608 the prophet H5030 took H3947 (8799) the yoke H4133 from off the prophet H5030 Jeremiah’s H3414 neck H6677, and brake H7665 (8799) it.
028:011 And Hananiah H2608 spake H0559 (8799) in the presence H5869 of all the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Even so will I break H7665 (8799) the yoke H5923 of Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 from the neck H6677 of all nations H1471 within the space of two full H3117 years H8141. And the prophet H5030 Jeremiah H3414 went H3212 (8799) his way H1870.
028:012 Then the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto Jeremiah H3414 [the prophet], after H0310 that Hananiah H2608 the prophet H5030 had broken H7665 (8800) the yoke H4133 from off the neck H6677 of the prophet H5030 Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800),
028:013 Go H1980 (8800) and tell H0559 (8804) Hananiah H2608, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Thou hast broken H7665 (8804) the yokes H4133 of wood H6086; but thou shalt make H6213 (8804) for them yokes H4133 of iron H1270.
028:014 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; I have put H5414 (8804) a yoke H5923 of iron H1270 upon the neck H6677 of all these nations H1471, that they may serve H5647 (8800) Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894; and they shall serve H5647 (8804) him: and I have given H5414 (8804) him the beasts H2416 of the field H7704 also.
028:015 Then said H0559 (8799) the prophet H5030 Jeremiah H3414 unto Hananiah H2608 the prophet H5030, Hear H8085 (8798) now, Hananiah H2608; The LORD H3068 hath not sent H7971 (8804) thee; but thou makest this people H5971 to trust H0982 (8689) in a lie H8267.
028:016 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I will cast H7971 (8764) thee from off the face H6440 of the earth H0127: this year H8141 thou shalt die H4191 (8801), because thou hast taught H1696 (8765) rebellion H5627 against the LORD H3068.
028:017 So Hananiah H2608 the prophet H5030 died H4191 (8799) the same year H8141 in the seventh H7637 month H2320.
029:001 ¶  Now these [are] the words H1697 of the letter H5612 that Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 sent H7971 (8804) from Jerusalem H3389 unto the residue H3499 of the elders H2205 which were carried away captives H1473, and to the priests H3548, and to the prophets H5030, and to all the people H5971 whom Nebuchadnezzar H5019 had carried away captive H1540 (8689) from Jerusalem H3389 to Babylon H0894;
029:002 (After H0310 that Jeconiah H3204 the king H4428, and the queen H1377, and the eunuchs H5631, the princes H8269 of Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, and the carpenters H2796, and the smiths H4525, were departed H3318 (8800) from Jerusalem H3389;)
029:003 By the hand H3027 of Elasah H0501 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, and Gemariah H1587 the son H1121 of Hilkiah H2518, (whom Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063 sent H7971 (8804) unto Babylon H0894 to Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 ) saying H0559 (8800),
029:004 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, unto all that are carried away captives H1473, whom I have caused to be carried away H1540 (8689) from Jerusalem H3389 unto Babylon H0894;
029:005 Build H1129 (8798) ye houses H1004, and dwell H3427 (8798) [in them]; and plant H5193 (8798) gardens H1593, and eat H0398 (8798) the fruit H6529 of them;
029:006 Take H3947 (8798) ye wives H0802, and beget H3205 (8685) sons H1121 and daughters H1323; and take H3947 (8798) wives H0802 for your sons H1121, and give H5414 (8798) your daughters H1323 to husbands H0582, that they may bear H3205 (8799) sons H1121 and daughters H1121; that ye may be increased H7235 (8798) there, and not diminished H4591 (8799).
029:007 And seek H1875 (8798) the peace H7965 of the city H5892 whither I have caused you to be carried away captives H1540 (8689), and pray H6419 (8690) unto the LORD H3068 for it: for in the peace H7965 thereof shall ye have peace H7965.
029:008 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Let not your prophets H5030 and your diviners H7080 (8802), that [be] in the midst H7130 of you, deceive H5377 (8686) you, neither hearken H8085 (8799) to your dreams H2472 which ye cause to be dreamed H2492 (8688).
029:009 For they prophesy H5012 (8737) falsely H8267 unto you in my name H8034: I have not sent H7971 (8804) them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
029:010 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, That after H6310 seventy H7657 years H8141 be accomplished H4390 (8800) at Babylon H0894 I will visit H6485 (8799) you, and perform H6965 (8689) my good H2896 word H1697 toward you, in causing you to return H7725 (8687) to this place H4725.
029:011 For I know H3045 (8804) the thoughts H4284 that I think H2803 (8802) toward you, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, thoughts H4284 of peace H7965, and not of evil H7451, to give H5414 (8800) you an expected H8615 end H0319.
029:012 Then shall ye call H7121 (8804) upon me, and ye shall go H1980 (8804) and pray H6419 (8694) unto me, and I will hearken H8085 (8804) unto you.
029:013 And ye shall seek H1245 (8765) me, and find H4672 (8804) [me], when ye shall search H1875 (8799) for me with all your heart H3824.
029:014 And I will be found H4672 (8738) of you, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: and I will turn away H7725 (8804) your captivity H7622 (8675) H7622, and I will gather H6908 (8765) you from all the nations H1471, and from all the places H4725 whither I have driven H5080 (8689) you, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; and I will bring you again H7725 (8689) into the place H4725 whence I caused you to be carried away captive H1540 (8689).
029:015 Because ye have said H0559 (8804), The LORD H3068 hath raised us up H6965 (8689) prophets H5030 in Babylon H0894;
029:016 [Know] that thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of the king H4428 that sitteth H3427 (8802) upon the throne H3678 of David H1732, and of all the people H5971 that dwelleth H3427 (8802) in this city H5892, [and] of your brethren H0251 that are not gone forth H3318 (8804) with you into captivity H1473;
029:017 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; Behold, I will send H7971 (8764) upon them the sword H2719, the famine H7458, and the pestilence H1698, and will make H5414 (8804) them like vile H8182 figs H8384, that cannot be eaten H0398 (8735), they are so evil H7455.
029:018 And I will persecute H7291 (8804) them H0310 with the sword H2719, with the famine H7458, and with the pestilence H1698, and will deliver H5414 (8804) them to be removed H2189 (8675) H2113 to all the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776, to be a curse H0423, and an astonishment H8047, and an hissing H8322, and a reproach H2781, among all the nations H1471 whither I have driven H5080 (8689) them:
029:019 Because they have not hearkened H8085 (8804) to my words H1697, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, which I sent H7971 (8804) unto them by my servants H5650 the prophets H5030, rising up early H7925 (8687) and sending H7971 (8800) [them]; but ye would not hear H8085 (8804), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
029:020 Hear H8085 (8798) ye therefore the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, all ye of the captivity H1473, whom I have sent H7971 (8765) from Jerusalem H3389 to Babylon H0894:
029:021 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, of Ahab H0256 the son H1121 of Kolaiah H6964, and of Zedekiah H6667 the son H1121 of Maaseiah H4641, which prophesy H5012 (8737) a lie H8267 unto you in my name H8034; Behold, I will deliver H5414 (8802) them into the hand H3027 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894; and he shall slay H5221 (8689) them before your eyes H5869;
029:022 And of them shall be taken up H3947 (8795) a curse H7045 by all the captivity H1546 of Judah H3063 which [are] in Babylon H0894, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 make H7760 (8799) thee like Zedekiah H6667 and like Ahab H0256, whom the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 roasted H7033 (8804) in the fire H0784;
029:023 Because they have committed H6213 (8804) villany H5039 in Israel H3478, and have committed H6213 (8804) adultery H5003 (8762) with their neighbours H7453 ’ wives H0802, and have spoken H1696 (8762) lying H8267 words H1697 in my name H8034, which I have not commanded H6680 (8765) them; even I know H3045 (8802), and [am] a witness H5707, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
029:024 [Thus] shalt thou also speak H0559 (8799) to Shemaiah H8098 the Nehelamite H5161, saying H0559 (8800),
029:025 Thus speaketh H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Because thou hast sent H7971 (8804) letters H5612 in thy name H8034 unto all the people H5971 that [are] at Jerusalem H3389, and to Zephaniah H6846 the son H1121 of Maaseiah H4641 the priest H3548, and to all the priests H3548, saying H0559 (8800),
029:026 The LORD H3068 hath made H5414 (8804) thee priest H3548 in the stead of Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548, that ye should be officers H6496 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, for every man H0376 [that is] mad H7696 (8794), and maketh himself a prophet H5012 (8693), that thou shouldest put H5414 (8804) him in prison H4115, and in the stocks H6729.
029:027 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved H1605 (8804) Jeremiah H3414 of Anathoth H6069, which maketh himself a prophet H5012 (8693) to you?
029:028 For therefore he sent H7971 (8804) unto us [in] Babylon H0894, saying H0559 (8800), This H1931 [captivity is] long H0752: build H1129 (8798) ye houses H1004, and dwell H3427 (8798) [in them]; and plant H5193 (8798) gardens H1593, and eat H0398 (8798) the fruit H6529 of them.
029:029 And Zephaniah H6846 the priest H3548 read H7121 (8799) this letter H5612 in the ears H0241 of Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030.
029:030 Then came the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 unto Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800),
029:031 Send H7971 (8798) to all them of the captivity H1473, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 concerning Shemaiah H8098 the Nehelamite H5161; Because that Shemaiah H8098 hath prophesied H5012 (8738) unto you, and I sent H7971 (8804) him not, and he caused you to trust H0982 (8686) in a lie H8267:
029:032 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I will punish H6485 (8802) Shemaiah H8098 the Nehelamite H5161, and his seed H2233: he shall not have a man H0376 to dwell H3427 (8802) among H8432 this people H5971; neither shall he behold H7200 (8799) the good H2896 that I will do H6213 (8802) for my people H5971, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; because he hath taught H1696 (8765) rebellion H5627 against the LORD H3068.
030:001 ¶  The word H1697 that came to Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
030:002 Thus speaketh H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Write H3789 (8798) thee all the words H1697 that I have spoken H1696 (8765) unto thee in a book H5612.
030:003 For, lo, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I will bring again H7725 (8804) the captivity H7622 of my people H5971 Israel H3478 and Judah H3063, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068: and I will cause them to return H7725 (8689) to the land H0776 that I gave H5414 (8804) to their fathers H0001, and they shall possess H3423 (8804) it.
030:004 And these [are] the words H1697 that the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) concerning Israel H3478 and concerning Judah H3063.
030:005 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; We have heard H8085 (8804) a voice H6963 of trembling H2731, of fear H6343, and not of peace H7965.
030:006 Ask H7592 (8798) ye now, and see H7200 (8798) whether a man H2145 doth travail with child H3205 (8802)? wherefore do I see H7200 (8804) every man H1397 with his hands H3027 on his loins H2504, as a woman in travail H3205 (8802), and all faces H6440 are turned H2015 (8738) into paleness H3420?
030:007 Alas H1945! for that day H3117 [is] great H1419, so that H0369 none [is] like it: it [is] even the time H6256 of Jacob’s H3290 trouble H6869; but he shall be saved H3467 (8735) out of it.
030:008 For it shall come to pass in that day H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, [that] I will break H7665 (8799) his yoke H5923 from off thy neck H6677, and will burst H5423 (8762) thy bonds H4147, and strangers H2114 (8801) shall no more serve H5647 (8799) themselves of him:
030:009 But they shall serve H5647 (8804) the LORD H3068 their God H0430, and David H1732 their king H4428, whom I will raise up H6965 (8686) unto them.
030:010 Therefore fear H3372 (8799) thou not, O my servant H5650 Jacob H3290, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; neither be dismayed H2865 (8735), O Israel H3478: for, lo, I will save H3467 (8688) thee from afar H7350, and thy seed H2233 from the land H0776 of their captivity H7628; and Jacob H3290 shall return H7725 (8804), and shall be in rest H8252 (8804), and be quiet H7599 (8768), and none shall make [him] afraid H2729 (8688).
030:011 For I [am] with thee, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, to save H3467 (8687) thee: though I make H6213 (8799) a full end H3617 of all nations H1471 whither I have scattered H6327 (8689) thee, yet will I not make H6213 (8799) a full end H3617 of thee: but I will correct H3256 (8765) thee in measure H4941, and will not leave thee altogether H5352 (8763) unpunished H5352 (8762).
030:012 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Thy bruise H7667 [is] incurable H0605 (8803), [and] thy wound H4347 [is] grievous H2470 (8737).
030:013 [There is] none to plead H1777 (8802) thy cause H1779, that thou mayest be bound up H4205: thou hast no healing H8585 medicines H7499.
030:014 All thy lovers H0157 (8764) have forgotten H7911 (8804) thee; they seek H1875 (8799) thee not; for I have wounded H5221 (8689) thee with the wound H4347 of an enemy H0341 (8802), with the chastisement H4148 of a cruel one H0394, for the multitude H7230 of thine iniquity H5771; [because] thy sins H2403 were increased H6105 (8804).
030:015 Why criest H2199 (8799) thou for thine affliction H7667? thy sorrow H4341 [is] incurable H0605 (8803) for the multitude H7230 of thine iniquity H5771: [because] thy sins H2403 were increased H6105 (8804), I have done H6213 (8804) these things unto thee.
030:016 Therefore all they that devour H0398 (8802) thee shall be devoured H0398 (8735); and all thine adversaries H6862, every one of them, shall go H3212 (8799) into captivity H7628; and they that spoil H7601 (8802) (8675) H8154 (8802) thee shall be a spoil H4933, and all that prey H0962 (8802) upon thee will I give H5414 (8799) for a prey H0957.
030:017 For I will restore H5927 (8686) health H0724 unto thee, and I will heal H7495 (8799) thee of thy wounds H4347, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; because they called H7121 (8804) thee an Outcast H5080 (8737), [saying], This [is] Zion H6726, whom no man seeketh after H1875 (8802).
030:018 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I will bring again H7725 (8802) the captivity H7622 of Jacob’s H3290 tents H0168, and have mercy H7355 (8762) on his dwellingplaces H4908; and the city H5892 shall be builded H1129 (8738) upon her own heap H8510, and the palace H0759 shall remain H3427 (8799) after the manner H4941 thereof.
030:019 And out of them shall proceed H3318 (8804) thanksgiving H8426 and the voice H6963 of them that make merry H7832 (8764): and I will multiply H7235 (8689) them, and they shall not be few H4591 (8799); I will also glorify H3513 (8689) them, and they shall not be small H6819 (8799).
030:020 Their children H1121 also shall be as aforetime H6924, and their congregation H5712 shall be established H3559 (8735) before H6440 me, and I will punish H6485 (8804) all that oppress H3905 (8801) them.
030:021 And their nobles H0117 shall be of themselves, and their governor H4910 (8802) shall proceed H3318 (8799) from the midst H7130 of them; and I will cause him to draw near H7126 (8689), and he shall approach H5066 (8738) unto me: for who [is] this that engaged H6148 (8804) his heart H3820 to approach H5066 (8800) unto me? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
030:022 And ye shall be my people H5971, and I will be your God H0430.
030:023 Behold, the whirlwind H5591 of the LORD H3068 goeth forth H3318 (8804) with fury H2534, a continuing H1641 (8706) whirlwind H5591: it shall fall with pain H2342 (8799) upon the head H7218 of the wicked H7563.
030:024 The fierce H2740 anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 shall not return H7725 (8799), until he have done H6213 (8800) [it], and until he have performed H6965 (8687) the intents H4209 of his heart H3820: in the latter H0319 days H3117 ye shall consider H0995 (8709) it.
031:001 ¶  At the same time H6256, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, will I be the God H0430 of all the families H4940 of Israel H3478, and they shall be my people H5971.
031:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, The people H5971 [which were] left H8300 of the sword H2719 found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in the wilderness H4057; [even] Israel H3478, when I went H1980 (8800) to cause him to rest H7280 (8687).
031:003 The LORD H3068 hath appeared H7200 (8738) of old H7350 unto me, [saying], Yea, I have loved H0157 (8804) thee with an everlasting H5769 love H0160: therefore with lovingkindness H2617 have I drawn H4900 (8804) thee.
031:004 Again I will build H1129 (8799) thee, and thou shalt be built H1129 (8738), O virgin H1330 of Israel H3478: thou shalt again be adorned H5710 (8799) with thy tabrets H8596, and shalt go forth H3318 (8804) in the dances H4234 of them that make merry H7832 (8764).
031:005 Thou shalt yet plant H5193 (8799) vines H3754 upon the mountains H2022 of Samaria H8111: the planters H5193 (8802) shall plant H5193 (8804), and shall eat [them] as common things H2490 (8765).
031:006 For there shall be H3426 a day H3117, [that] the watchmen H5341 (8802) upon the mount H2022 Ephraim H0669 shall cry H7121 (8804), Arise H6965 (8798) ye, and let us go up H5927 (8799) to Zion H6726 unto the LORD H3068 our God H0430.
031:007 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Sing H7442 (8798) with gladness H8057 for Jacob H3290, and shout H6670 (8761) among the chief H7218 of the nations H1471: publish H8085 (8685) ye, praise H1984 (8761) ye, and say H0559 (8798), O LORD H3068, save H3467 (8685) thy people H5971, the remnant H7611 of Israel H3478.
031:008 Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) them from the north H6828 country H0776, and gather H6908 (8765) them from the coasts H3411 of the earth H0776, [and] with them the blind H5787 and the lame H6455, the woman with child H2030 and her that travaileth with child H3205 (8802) together H3162: a great H1419 company H6951 shall return H7725 (8799) thither.
031:009 They shall come H0935 (8799) with weeping H1065, and with supplications H8469 will I lead H2986 (8686) them: I will cause them to walk H3212 (8686) by the rivers H5158 of waters H4325 in a straight H3477 way H1870, wherein they shall not stumble H3782 (8735): for I am a father H0001 to Israel H3478, and Ephraim H0669 [is] my firstborn H1060.
031:010 Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, O ye nations H1471, and declare H5046 (8685) [it] in the isles H0339 afar off H4801, and say H0559 (8798), He that scattered H2219 (8764) Israel H3478 will gather H6908 (8762) him, and keep H8104 (8804) him, as a shepherd H7462 (8802) [doth] his flock H5739.
031:011 For the LORD H3068 hath redeemed H6299 (8804) Jacob H3290, and ransomed H1350 (8804) him from the hand H3027 of [him that was] stronger H2389 than he.
031:012 Therefore they shall come H0935 (8804) and sing H7442 (8765) in the height H4791 of Zion H6726, and shall flow together H5102 (8804) to the goodness H2898 of the LORD H3068, for wheat H1715, and for wine H8492, and for oil H3323, and for the young H1121 of the flock H6629 and of the herd H1241: and their soul H5315 shall be as a watered H7302 garden H1588; and they shall not sorrow H1669 (8800) any more H3254 (8686) at all.
031:013 Then shall the virgin H1330 rejoice H8055 (8799) in the dance H4234, both young men H0970 and old H2205 together H3162: for I will turn H2015 (8804) their mourning H0060 into joy H8342, and will comfort H5162 (8765) them, and make them rejoice H8055 (8765) from their sorrow H3015.
031:014 And I will satiate H7301 (8765) the soul H5315 of the priests H3548 with fatness H1880, and my people H5971 shall be satisfied H7646 (8799) with my goodness H2898, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
031:015 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; A voice H6963 was heard H8085 (8738) in Ramah H7414, lamentation H5092, [and] bitter H8563 weeping H1065; Rahel H7354 weeping H1058 (8764) for her children H1121 refused H3985 (8765) to be comforted H5162 (8736) for her children H1121, because they [were] not.
031:016 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Refrain H4513 (8798) thy voice H6963 from weeping H1065, and thine eyes H5869 from tears H1832: for thy work H6468 shall be H3426 rewarded H7939, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; and they shall come again H7725 (8804) from the land H0776 of the enemy H0341 (8802).
031:017 And there is H3426 hope H8615 in thine end H0319, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that thy children H1121 shall come again H7725 (8804) to their own border H1366.
031:018 I have surely H8085 (8800) heard H8085 (8804) Ephraim H0669 bemoaning H5110 (8711) himself [thus]; Thou hast chastised H3256 (8765) me, and I was chastised H3256 (8735), as a bullock H5695 unaccustomed H3808 H3925 (8795) [to the yoke]: turn H7725 (8685) thou me, and I shall be turned H7725 (8799); for thou [art] the LORD H3068 my God H0430.
031:019 Surely after H0310 that I was turned H7725 (8800), I repented H5162 (8738); and after H0310 that I was instructed H3045 (8736), I smote H5606 (8804) upon [my] thigh H3409: I was ashamed H0954 (8804), yea, even confounded H3637 (8738), because I did bear H5375 (8804) the reproach H2781 of my youth H5271.
031:020 [Is] Ephraim H0669 my dear H3357 son H1121? [is he] a pleasant H8191 child H3206? for since H1767 I spake H1696 (8763) against him, I do earnestly H2142 (8800) remember H2142 (8799) him still: therefore my bowels H4578 are troubled H1993 (8804) for him; I will surely H7355 (8763) have mercy H7355 (8762) upon him, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
031:021 Set thee up H5324 (8685) waymarks H6725, make H7760 (8798) thee high heaps H8564: set H7896 (8798) thine heart H3820 toward the highway H4546, [even] the way H1870 [which] thou wentest H1980 (8804): turn again H7725 (8798), O virgin H1330 of Israel H3478, turn again H7725 (8798) to these thy cities H5892.
031:022 How long wilt thou go about H2559 (8691), O thou backsliding H7728 daughter H1323? for the LORD H3068 hath created H1254 (8804) a new thing H2319 in the earth H0776, A woman H5347 shall compass H5437 (8779) a man H1397.
031:023 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; As yet they shall use H0559 (8799) this speech H1697 in the land H0776 of Judah H3063 and in the cities H5892 thereof, when I shall bring again H7725 (8800) their captivity H7622; The LORD H3068 bless H1288 (8762) thee, O habitation H5116 of justice H6664, [and] mountain H2022 of holiness H6944.
031:024 And there shall dwell H3427 (8804) in Judah H3063 itself, and in all the cities H5892 thereof together H3162, husbandmen H0406, and they [that] go forth H5265 (8804) with flocks H5739.
031:025 For I have satiated H7301 (8689) the weary H5889 soul H5315, and I have replenished H4390 (8765) every sorrowful H1669 (8804) soul H5315.
031:026 Upon this I awaked H6974 (8689), and beheld H7200 (8799); and my sleep H8142 was sweet H6149 (8804) unto me.
031:027 Behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I will sow H2232 (8804) the house H1004 of Israel H3478 and the house H1004 of Judah H3063 with the seed H2233 of man H0120, and with the seed H2233 of beast H0929.
031:028 And it shall come to pass, [that] like as I have watched over H8245 (8804) them, to pluck up H5428 (8800), and to break down H5422 (8800), and to throw down H2040 (8800), and to destroy H0006 (8687), and to afflict H7489 (8687); so will I watch over H8245 (8799) them, to build H1129 (8800), and to plant H5193 (8800), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
031:029 In those days H3117 they shall say H0559 (8799) no more, The fathers H0001 have eaten H0398 (8804) a sour grape H1155, and the children’s H1121 teeth H8127 are set on edge H6949 (8799).
031:030 But every one H0376 shall die H4191 (8799) for his own iniquity H5771: every man H0120 that eateth H0398 (8802) the sour grape H1155, his teeth H8127 shall be set on edge H6949 (8799).
031:031 Behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I will make H3772 (8804) a new H2319 covenant H1285 with the house H1004 of Israel H3478, and with the house H1004 of Judah H3063:
031:032 Not according to the covenant H1285 that I made H3772 (8804) with their fathers H0001 in the day H3117 [that] I took H2388 (8687) them by the hand H3027 to bring them out H3318 (8687) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714; which my covenant H1285 they brake H6565 (8689), although I was an husband H1166 (8804) unto them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068:
031:033 But this [shall be] the covenant H1285 that I will make H3772 (8799) with the house H1004 of Israel H3478; After H0310 those days H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, I will put H5414 (8804) my law H8451 in their inward parts H7130, and write H3789 (8799) it in their hearts H3820; and will be their God H0430, and they shall be my people H5971.
031:034 And they shall teach H3925 (8762) no more every man H0376 his neighbour H7453, and every man H0376 his brother H0251, saying H0559 (8800), Know H3045 (8798) the LORD H3068: for they shall all know H3045 (8799) me, from the least H6996 of them unto the greatest H1419 of them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: for I will forgive H5545 (8799) their iniquity H5771, and I will remember H2142 (8799) their sin H2403 no more.
031:035 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, which giveth H5414 (8802) the sun H8121 for a light H0216 by day H3119, [and] the ordinances H2708 of the moon H3394 and of the stars H3556 for a light H0216 by night H3915, which divideth H7280 (8802) the sea H3220 when the waves H1530 thereof roar H1993 (8799); The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] his name H8034:
031:036 If those ordinances H2706 depart H4185 (8799) from before H6440 me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, [then] the seed H2233 of Israel H3478 also shall cease H7673 (8799) from being a nation H1471 before H6440 me for ever H3117.
031:037 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; If heaven H8064 above H4605 can be measured H4058 (8735), and the foundations H4146 of the earth H0776 searched out H2713 (8735) beneath H4295, I will also cast off H3988 (8799) all the seed H2233 of Israel H3478 for all that they have done H6213 (8804), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
031:038 Behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that the city H5892 shall be built H1129 (8738) to the LORD H3068 from the tower H4026 of Hananeel H2606 unto the gate H8179 of the corner H6438.
031:039 And the measuring H4060 line H6957 (8675) H6961 shall yet go forth H3318 (8804) over against it upon the hill H1389 Gareb H1619, and shall compass about H5437 (8738) to Goath H1601.
031:040 And the whole valley H6010 of the dead bodies H6297, and of the ashes H1880, and all the fields H7709 (8675) H8309 unto the brook H5158 of Kidron H6939, unto the corner H6438 of the horse H5483 gate H8179 toward the east H4217, [shall be] holy H6944 unto the LORD H3068; it shall not be plucked up H5428 (8735), nor thrown down H2040 (8735) any more for ever H5769.
032:001 ¶  The word H1697 that came to Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068 in the tenth H6224 year H8141 of Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063, which [was] the eighteenth H8083 H6240 H8141 year H8141 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019.
032:002 For then the king H4428 of Babylon’s H0894 army H2428 besieged H6696 (8802) Jerusalem H3389: and Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 was shut up H3607 (8803) in the court H2691 of the prison H4307, which [was] in the king H4428 of Judah’s H3063 house H1004.
032:003 For Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063 had shut him up H3607 (8804), saying H0559 (8800), Wherefore dost thou prophesy H5012 (8737), and say H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will give H5414 (8802) this city H5892 into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and he shall take H3920 (8804) it;
032:004 And Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063 shall not escape H4422 (8735) out of the hand H3027 of the Chaldeans H3778, but shall surely H5414 (8736) be delivered H5414 (8735) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and shall speak H1696 (8765) with him mouth H6310 to mouth H6310, and his eyes H5869 shall behold H7200 (8799) his eyes H5869;
032:005 And he shall lead H3212 (8686) Zedekiah H6667 to Babylon H0894, and there shall he be until I visit H6485 (8800) him, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: though ye fight H3898 (8735) with the Chaldeans H3778, ye shall not prosper H6743 (8686).
032:006 And Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799), The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
032:007 Behold, Hanameel H2601 the son H1121 of Shallum H7967 thine uncle H1730 shall come H0935 (8802) unto thee, saying H0559 (8800), Buy H7069 (8798) thee my field H7704 that [is] in Anathoth H6068: for the right H4941 of redemption H1353 [is] thine to buy H7069 (8800) [it].
032:008 So Hanameel H2601 mine uncle’s H1730 son H1121 came H0935 (8799) to me in the court H2691 of the prison H4307 according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799) unto me, Buy H7069 (8798) my field H7704, I pray thee, that [is] in Anathoth H6068, which [is] in the country H0776 of Benjamin H1144: for the right H4941 of inheritance H3425 [is] thine, and the redemption H1353 [is] thine; buy H7069 (8798) [it] for thyself. Then I knew H3045 (8799) that this [was] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
032:009 And I bought H7069 (8799) the field H7704 of Hanameel H2601 my uncle’s H1730 son H1121, that [was] in Anathoth H6068, and weighed H8254 (8799) him the money H3701, [even] seventeen H7651 H6235 shekels H8255 of silver H3701.
032:010 And I subscribed H3789 (8799) the evidence H5612, and sealed H2856 (8799) [it], and took H5749 (8686) witnesses H5707, and weighed H8254 (8799) [him] the money H3701 in the balances H3976.
032:011 So I took H3947 (8799) the evidence H5612 of the purchase H4736, [both] that which was sealed H2856 (8803) [according] to the law H4687 and custom H2706, and that which was open H1540 (8803):
032:012 And I gave H5414 (8799) the evidence H5612 of the purchase H4736 unto Baruch H1263 the son H1121 of Neriah H5374, the son H1121 of Maaseiah H4271, in the sight H5869 of Hanameel H2601 mine uncle’s H1730 [son], and in the presence H5869 of the witnesses H5707 that subscribed H3789 (8802) the book H5612 of the purchase H4736, before H5869 all the Jews H3064 that sat H3427 (8802) in the court H2691 of the prison H4307.
032:013 And I charged H6680 (8762) Baruch H1263 before H5869 them, saying H0559 (8800),
032:014 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Take H3947 (8800) these evidences H5612, this evidence H5612 of the purchase H4736, both which is sealed H2856 (8803), and this evidence H5612 which is open H1540 (8803); and put H5414 (8804) them in an earthen H2789 vessel H3627, that they may continue H5975 (8799) many H7227 days H3117.
032:015 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Houses H1004 and fields H7704 and vineyards H3754 shall be possessed again H7069 (8735) in this land H0776.
032:016 Now when H0310 I had delivered H5414 (8800) the evidence H5612 of the purchase H4736 unto Baruch H1263 the son H1121 of Neriah H5374, I prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
032:017 Ah H0162 Lord H0136 GOD H3069! behold, thou hast made H6213 (8804) the heaven H8064 and the earth H0776 by thy great H1419 power H3581 and stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220, [and] there is nothing H1697 too hard H6381 (8735) for thee:
032:018 Thou shewest H6213 (8802) lovingkindness H2617 unto thousands H0505, and recompensest H7999 (8764) the iniquity H5771 of the fathers H0001 into the bosom H2436 of their children H1121 after H0310 them: the Great H1419, the Mighty H1368 God H0410, the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, [is] his name H8034,
032:019 Great H1419 in counsel H6098, and mighty H7227 in work H5950: for thine eyes H5869 [are] open H6491 (8803) upon all the ways H1870 of the sons H1121 of men H0120: to give H5414 (8800) every one H0376 according to his ways H1870, and according to the fruit H6529 of his doings H4611:
032:020 Which hast set H7760 (8804) signs H0226 and wonders H4159 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, [even] unto this day H3117, and in Israel H3478, and among [other] men H0120; and hast made H6213 (8799) thee a name H8034, as at this day H3117;
032:021 And hast brought forth H3318 (8686) thy people H5971 Israel H3478 out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 with signs H0226, and with wonders H4159, and with a strong H2389 hand H3027, and with a stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H0248, and with great H1419 terror H4172;
032:022 And hast given H5414 (8799) them this land H0776, which thou didst swear H7650 (8738) to their fathers H0001 to give H5414 (8800) them, a land H0776 flowing H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706;
032:023 And they came in H0935 (8799), and possessed H3423 (8799) it; but they obeyed H8085 (8804) not thy voice H6963, neither walked H1980 (8804) in thy law H8451; they have done H6213 (8804) nothing of all that thou commandedst H6680 (8765) them to do H6213 (8800): therefore thou hast caused all this evil H7451 to come H7122 (8686) upon them:
032:024 Behold the mounts H5550, they are come H0935 (8804) unto the city H5892 to take H3920 (8800) it; and the city H5892 is given H5414 (8738) into the hand H3027 of the Chaldeans H3778, that fight H3898 (8737) against it, because H6440 of the sword H2719, and of the famine H7458, and of the pestilence H1698: and what thou hast spoken H1696 (8765) is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest H7200 (8802) [it].
032:025 And thou hast said H0559 (8804) unto me, O Lord H0136 GOD H3069, Buy H7069 (8798) thee the field H7704 for money H3701, and take H5749 (8685) witnesses H5707; for the city H5892 is given H5414 (8738) into the hand H3027 of the Chaldeans H3778.
032:026 Then came the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 unto Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800),
032:027 Behold, I [am] the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of all flesh H1320: is there any thing H1697 too hard H6381 (8735) for me?
032:028 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I will give H5414 (8802) this city H5892 into the hand H3027 of the Chaldeans H3778, and into the hand H3027 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and he shall take H3920 (8804) it:
032:029 And the Chaldeans H3778, that fight H3898 (8737) against this city H5892, shall come H0935 (8804) and set H3341 (8689) fire H0784 on this city H5892, and burn H8313 (8804) it with the houses H1004, upon whose roofs H1406 they have offered incense H6999 (8765) unto Baal H1168, and poured out H5258 (8689) drink offerings H5262 unto other H0312 gods H0430, to provoke me to anger H3707 (8687).
032:030 For the children H1121 of Israel H3478 and the children H1121 of Judah H3063 have only done H6213 (8802) evil H7451 before H5869 me from their youth H5271: for the children H1121 of Israel H3478 have only provoked me to anger H3707 (8688) with the work H4639 of their hands H3027, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
032:031 For this city H5892 hath been to me [as] a provocation of mine anger H0639 and of my fury H2534 from the day H3117 that they built H1129 (8804) it even unto this day H3117; that I should remove H5493 (8687) it from before my face H6440,
032:032 Because of all the evil H7451 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 and of the children H1121 of Judah H3063, which they have done H6213 (8804) to provoke me to anger H3707 (8687), they, their kings H4428, their princes H8269, their priests H3548, and their prophets H5030, and the men H0376 of Judah H3063, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389.
032:033 And they have turned H6437 (8799) unto me the back H6203, and not the face H6440: though I taught H3925 (8763) them, rising up early H7925 (8687) and teaching H3925 (8763) [them], yet they have not hearkened H8085 (8802) to receive H3947 (8800) instruction H4148.
032:034 But they set H7760 (8799) their abominations H8251 in the house H1004, which is called H7121 (8738) by my name H8034, to defile H2930 (8763) it.
032:035 And they built H1129 (8799) the high places H1116 of Baal H1168, which [are] in the valley H1516 of the son H1121 of Hinnom H2011, to cause their sons H1121 and their daughters H1323 to pass H5674 (8687) through [the fire] unto Molech H4432; which I commanded H6680 (8765) them not, neither came H5927 (8804) it into my mind H3820, that they should do H6213 (8800) this abomination H8441, to cause Judah H3063 to sin H2398 (8687).
032:036 And now therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, concerning this city H5892, whereof ye say H0559 (8802), It shall be delivered H5414 (8738) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 by the sword H2719, and by the famine H7458, and by the pestilence H1698;
032:037 Behold, I will gather them out H6908 (8764) of all countries H0776, whither I have driven H5080 (8689) them in mine anger H0639, and in my fury H2534, and in great H1419 wrath H7110; and I will bring them again H7725 (8689) unto this place H4725, and I will cause them to dwell H3427 (8689) safely H0983:
032:038 And they shall be my people H5971, and I will be their God H0430:
032:039 And I will give H5414 (8804) them one H0259 heart H3820, and one H0259 way H1870, that they may fear H3372 (8800) me for ever H3117, for the good H2896 of them, and of their children H1121 after H0310 them:
032:040 And I will make H3772 (8804) an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285 with them, that I will not turn away H7725 (8799) from them H0310, to do them good H3190 (8687); but I will put H5414 (8799) my fear H3374 in their hearts H3824, that they shall not depart H5493 (8800) from me.
032:041 Yea, I will rejoice H7797 (8804) over them to do them good H2895 (8687), and I will plant H5193 (8804) them in this land H0776 assuredly H0571 with my whole heart H3820 and with my whole soul H5315.
032:042 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Like as I have brought H0935 (8689) all this great H1419 evil H7451 upon this people H5971, so will I bring H0935 (8688) upon them all the good H2896 that I have promised H1696 (8802) them.
032:043 And fields H7704 shall be bought H7069 (8738) in this land H0776, whereof ye say H0559 (8802), [It is] desolate H8077 without man H0120 or beast H0929; it is given H5414 (8738) into the hand H3027 of the Chaldeans H3778.
032:044 Men shall buy H7069 (8799) fields H7704 for money H3701, and subscribe H3789 (8800) evidences H5612, and seal H2856 (8800) [them], and take H5749 (8687) witnesses H5707 in the land H0776 of Benjamin H1144, and in the places about H5439 Jerusalem H3389, and in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and in the cities H5892 of the mountains H2022, and in the cities H5892 of the valley H8219, and in the cities H5892 of the south H5045: for I will cause their captivity H7622 to return H7725 (8686), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
033:001 ¶  Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto Jeremiah H3414 the second H8145 time, while he was yet shut up H6113 (8803) in the court H2691 of the prison H4307, saying H0559 (8800),
033:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 the maker H6213 (8802) thereof, the LORD H3068 that formed H3335 (8802) it, to establish H3559 (8687) it; the LORD H3068 [is] his name H8034;
033:003 Call H7121 (8798) unto me, and I will answer H6030 (8799) thee, and shew H5046 (8686) thee great H1419 and mighty things H1219 (8803), which thou knowest H3045 (8804) not.
033:004 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, concerning the houses H1004 of this city H5892, and concerning the houses H1004 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063, which are thrown down H5422 (8803) by the mounts H5550, and by the sword H2719;
033:005 They come H0935 (8802) to fight H3898 (8736) with the Chaldeans H3778, but [it is] to fill H4390 (8763) them with the dead bodies H6297 of men H0120, whom I have slain H5221 (8689) in mine anger H0639 and in my fury H2534, and for all whose wickedness H7451 I have hid H5641 (8689) my face H6440 from this city H5892.
033:006 Behold, I will bring H5927 (8688) it health H0724 and cure H4832, and I will cure H7495 (8804) them, and will reveal H1540 (8765) unto them the abundance H6283 of peace H7965 and truth H0571.
033:007 And I will cause the captivity H7622 of Judah H3063 and the captivity H7622 of Israel H3478 to return H7725 (8689), and will build H1129 (8804) them, as at the first H7223.
033:008 And I will cleanse H2891 (8765) them from all their iniquity H5771, whereby they have sinned H2398 (8804) against me; and I will pardon H5545 (8804) all their iniquities H5771, whereby they have sinned H2398 (8804), and whereby they have transgressed H6586 (8804) against me.
033:009 And it shall be to me a name H8034 of joy H8342, a praise H8416 and an honour H8597 before all the nations H1471 of the earth H0776, which shall hear H8085 (8799) all the good H2896 that I do H6213 (8802) unto them: and they shall fear H6342 (8804) and tremble H7264 (8804) for all the goodness H2896 and for all the prosperity H7965 that I procure H6213 (8802) unto it.
033:010 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Again there shall be heard H8085 (8735) in this place H4725, which ye say H0559 (8802) [shall be] desolate H2720 without man H0120 and without beast H0929, [even] in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and in the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389, that are desolate H8074 (8737), without man H0120, and without inhabitant H3427 (8802), and without beast H0929,
033:011 The voice H6963 of joy H8342, and the voice H6963 of gladness H8057, the voice H6963 of the bridegroom H2860, and the voice H6963 of the bride H3618, the voice H6963 of them that shall say H0559 (8802), Praise H3034 (8685) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635: for the LORD H3068 [is] good H2896; for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769: [and] of them that shall bring H0935 (8688) the sacrifice of praise H8426 into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068. For I will cause to return H7725 (8686) the captivity H7622 of the land H0776, as at the first H7223, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
033:012 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; Again in this place H4725, which is desolate H2720 without man H0120 and without beast H0929, and in all the cities H5892 thereof, shall be an habitation H5116 of shepherds H7462 (8802) causing [their] flocks H6629 to lie down H7257 (8688).
033:013 In the cities H5892 of the mountains H2022, in the cities H5892 of the vale H8219, and in the cities H5892 of the south H5045, and in the land H0776 of Benjamin H1144, and in the places about H5439 Jerusalem H3389, and in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, shall the flocks H6629 pass again H5674 (8799) under the hands H3027 of him that telleth H4487 (8802) [them], saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
033:014 Behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I will perform H6965 (8689) that good H2896 thing H1697 which I have promised H1696 (8765) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478 and to the house H1004 of Judah H3063.
033:015 In those days H3117, and at that time H6256, will I cause the Branch H6780 of righteousness H6666 to grow up H6779 (8686) unto David H1732; and he shall execute H6213 (8804) judgment H4941 and righteousness H6666 in the land H0776.
033:016 In those days H3117 shall Judah H3063 be saved H3467 (8735), and Jerusalem H3389 shall dwell H7931 (8799) safely H0983: and this [is the name] wherewith she shall be called H7121 (8799), The LORD our righteousness H3072.
033:017 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; David H1732 shall never H3808 want H3772 (8735) a man H0376 to sit H3427 (8802) upon the throne H3678 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478;
033:018 Neither shall the priests H3548 the Levites H3881 want H3772 (8735) a man H0376 before H6440 me to offer H5927 (8688) burnt offerings H5930, and to kindle H6999 (8688) meat offerings H4503, and to do H6213 (8802) sacrifice H2077 continually H3117.
033:019 And the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800),
033:020 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; If ye can break H6565 (8686) my covenant H1285 of the day H3117, and my covenant H1285 of the night H3915, and that there should not be day H3119 and night H3915 in their season H6256;
033:021 [Then] may also my covenant H1285 be broken H6565 (8714) with David H1732 my servant H5650, that he should not have a son H1121 to reign H4427 (8802) upon his throne H3678; and with the Levites H3881 the priests H3548, my ministers H8334 (8764).
033:022 As the host H6635 of heaven H8064 cannot be numbered H5608 (8735), neither the sand H2344 of the sea H3220 measured H4058 (8735): so will I multiply H7235 (8686) the seed H2233 of David H1732 my servant H5650, and the Levites H3881 that minister H8334 (8764) unto me.
033:023 Moreover the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800),
033:024 Considerest H7200 (8804) thou not what this people H5971 have spoken H1696 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), The two H8147 families H4940 which the LORD H3068 hath chosen H0977 (8804), he hath even cast them off H3988 (8799)? thus they have despised H5006 (8799) my people H5971, that they should be no more a nation H1471 before H6440 them.
033:025 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; If my covenant H1285 [be] not with day H3119 and night H3915, [and if] I have not appointed H7760 (8804) the ordinances H2708 of heaven H8064 and earth H0776;
033:026 Then H1571 will I cast away H3988 (8799) the seed H2233 of Jacob H3290, and David H1732 my servant H5650, [so] that I will not take H3947 (8800) [any] of his seed H2233 [to be] rulers H4910 (8802) over the seed H2233 of Abraham H0085, Isaac H3446, and Jacob H3290: for I will cause their captivity H7622 to return H7725 (8686) (8675) H7725 (8799), and have mercy H7355 (8765) on them.
034:001 ¶  The word H1697 which came unto Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, when Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and all his army H2428, and all the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776 of his dominion H3027 H4475, and all the people H5971, fought H3898 (8737) against Jerusalem H3389, and against all the cities H5892 thereof, saying H0559 (8800),
034:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Go H1980 (8800) and speak H0559 (8804) to Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063, and tell H0559 (8804) him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I will give H5414 (8802) this city H5892 into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and he shall burn H8313 (8804) it with fire H0784:
034:003 And thou shalt not escape out H4422 (8735) of his hand H3027, but shalt surely H8610 (8800) be taken H8610 (8735), and delivered H5414 (8735) into his hand H3027; and thine eyes H5869 shall behold H7200 (8799) the eyes H5869 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and he shall speak H1696 (8762) with thee mouth H6310 to mouth H6310, and thou shalt go H0935 (8799) to Babylon H0894.
034:004 Yet hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, O Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063; Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of thee, Thou shalt not die H4191 (8799) by the sword H2719:
034:005 [But] thou shalt die H4191 (8799) in peace H7965: and with the burnings H4955 of thy fathers H0001, the former H7223 kings H4428 which were before H6440 thee, so shall they burn H8313 (8799) [odours] for thee; and they will lament H5594 (8799) thee, [saying], Ah H1945 lord H0113! for I have pronounced H1696 (8765) the word H1697, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
034:006 Then Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 spake H1696 (8762) all these words H1697 unto Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063 in Jerusalem H3389,
034:007 When the king H4428 of Babylon’s H0894 army H2428 fought H3898 (8737) against Jerusalem H3389, and against all the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 that were left H3498 (8737), against Lachish H3923, and against Azekah H5825: for these defenced H4013 cities H5892 remained H7604 (8738) of the cities H5892 of Judah H3063.
034:008 [This is] the word H1697 that came unto Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, after H0310 that the king H4428 Zedekiah H6667 had made H3772 (8800) a covenant H1285 with all the people H5971 which [were] at Jerusalem H3389, to proclaim H7121 (8800) liberty H1865 unto them;
034:009 That every man H0376 should let his manservant H5650, and every man H0376 his maidservant H8198, [being] an Hebrew H5680 or an Hebrewess H5680, go H7971 (8763) free H2670; that none should serve H5647 (8800) himself of them, [to wit], of a Jew H3064 his brother H0251.
034:010 Now when all the princes H8269, and all the people H5971, which had entered H0935 (8804) into the covenant H1285, heard H8085 (8799) that every one H0376 should let his manservant H5650, and every one H0376 his maidservant H8198, go H7971 (8763) free H2670, that none should serve H5647 (8800) themselves of them any more, then they obeyed H8085 (8799), and let [them] go H7971 (8762).
034:011 But afterward H0310 they turned H7725 (8799), and caused the servants H5650 and the handmaids H8198, whom they had let go H7971 (8765) free H2670, to return H7725 (8686), and brought them into subjection H3533 (8799) (8675) H3533 (8686) for servants H5650 and for handmaids H8198.
034:012 Therefore the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
034:013 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; I made H3772 (8804) a covenant H1285 with your fathers H0001 in the day H3117 that I brought them forth H3318 (8687) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, out of the house H1004 of bondmen H5650, saying H0559 (8800),
034:014 At the end H7093 of seven H7651 years H8141 let ye go H7971 (8762) every man H0376 his brother H0251 an Hebrew H5680, which hath been sold H4376 (8735) unto thee; and when he hath served H5647 (8804) thee six H8337 years H8141, thou shalt let him go H7971 (8765) free H2670 from thee: but your fathers H0001 hearkened H8085 (8804) not unto me, neither inclined H5186 (8689) their ear H0241.
034:015 And ye were now H3117 turned H7725 (8799), and had done H6213 (8799) right H3477 in my sight H5869, in proclaiming H7121 (8800) liberty H1865 every man H0376 to his neighbour H7453; and ye had made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 before H6440 me in the house H1004 which is called H7121 (8738) by my name H8034:
034:016 But ye turned H7725 (8799) and polluted H2490 (8762) my name H8034, and caused every man H0376 his servant H5650, and every man H0376 his handmaid H8198, whom ye had set H7971 (8765) at liberty H2670 at their pleasure H5315, to return H7725 (8686), and brought them into subjection H3533 (8799), to be unto you for servants H5650 and for handmaids H8198.
034:017 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Ye have not hearkened H8085 (8804) unto me, in proclaiming H7121 (8800) liberty H1865, every one H0376 to his brother H0251, and every man H0376 to his neighbour H7453: behold, I proclaim H7121 (8802) a liberty H1865 for you, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, to the sword H2719, to the pestilence H1698, and to the famine H7458; and I will make H5414 (8804) you to be removed H2189 (8675) H2113 into all the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776.
034:018 And I will give H5414 (8804) the men H0582 that have transgressed H5674 (8802) my covenant H1285, which have not performed H6965 (8689) the words H1697 of the covenant H1285 which they had made H3772 (8804) before H6440 me, when they cut H3772 (8804) the calf H5695 in twain H8147, and passed H5674 (8799) between the parts H1335 thereof,
034:019 The princes H8269 of Judah H3063, and the princes H8269 of Jerusalem H3389, the eunuchs H5631, and the priests H3548, and all the people H5971 of the land H0776, which passed H5674 (8802) between the parts H1335 of the calf H5695;
034:020 I will even give H5414 (8804) them into the hand H3027 of their enemies H0341 (8802), and into the hand H3027 of them that seek H1245 (8764) their life H5315: and their dead bodies H5038 shall be for meat H3978 unto the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064, and to the beasts H0929 of the earth H0776.
034:021 And Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063 and his princes H8269 will I give H5414 (8799) into the hand H3027 of their enemies H0341 (8802), and into the hand H3027 of them that seek H1245 (8764) their life H5315, and into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon’s H0894 army H2428, which are gone up H5927 (8802) from you.
034:022 Behold, I will command H6680 (8764), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and cause them to return H7725 (8689) to this city H5892; and they shall fight H3898 (8738) against it, and take H3920 (8804) it, and burn H8313 (8804) it with fire H0784: and I will make H5414 (8799) the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 a desolation H8077 without an inhabitant H3427 (8802).
035:001 ¶  The word H1697 which came unto Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068 in the days H3117 of Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800),
035:002 Go H1980 (8800) unto the house H1004 of the Rechabites H7397, and speak H1696 (8765) unto them, and bring H0935 (8689) them into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, into one H0259 of the chambers H3957, and give them wine H3196 to drink H8248 (8689).
035:003 Then I took H3947 (8799) Jaazaniah H2970 the son H1121 of Jeremiah H3414, the son H1121 of Habaziniah H2262, and his brethren H0251, and all his sons H1121, and the whole house H1004 of the Rechabites H7397;
035:004 And I brought H0935 (8686) them into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, into the chamber H3957 of the sons H1121 of Hanan H2605, the son H1121 of Igdaliah H3012, a man H0376 of God H0430, which [was] by H0681 the chamber H3957 of the princes H8269, which [was] above H4605 the chamber H3957 of Maaseiah H4641 the son H1121 of Shallum H7967, the keeper H8104 (8802) of the door H5592:
035:005 And I set H5414 (8799) before H6440 the sons H1121 of the house H1004 of the Rechabites H7397 pots H1375 full H4392 of wine H3196, and cups H3563, and I said H0559 (8799) unto them, Drink H8354 (8798) ye wine H3196.
035:006 But they said H0559 (8799), We will drink H8354 (8799) no wine H3196: for Jonadab H3122 the son H1121 of Rechab H7394 our father H0001 commanded H6680 (8765) us, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall drink H8354 (8799) no wine H3196, [neither ye], nor your sons H1121 for H5704 ever H5769:
035:007 Neither shall ye build H1129 (8799) house H1004, nor sow H2232 (8799) seed H2233, nor plant H5193 (8799) vineyard H3754, nor have [any]: but all your days H3117 ye shall dwell H3427 (8799) in tents H0168; that ye may live H2421 (8799) many H7227 days H3117 in H6440 the land H0127 where ye [be] strangers H1481 (8802).
035:008 Thus have we obeyed H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of Jonadab H3082 the son H1121 of Rechab H7394 our father H0001 in all that he hath charged H6680 (8765) us, to drink H8354 (8800) no wine H3196 all our days H3117, we, our wives H0802, our sons H1121, nor our daughters H1323;
035:009 Nor to build H1129 (8800) houses H1004 for us to dwell in H3427 (8800): neither have we vineyard H3754, nor field H7704, nor seed H2233:
035:010 But we have dwelt in H3427 (8799) tents H0168, and have obeyed H8085 (8799), and done H6213 (8799) according to all that Jonadab H3122 our father H0001 commanded H6680 (8765) us.
035:011 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 came up H5927 (8800) into the land H0776, that we said H0559 (8799), Come H0935 (8798), and let us go H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389 for fear H6440 of the army H2428 of the Chaldeans H3778, and for fear H6440 of the army H2428 of the Syrians H0758: so we dwell H3427 (8799) at Jerusalem H3389.
035:012 Then came the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 unto Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800),
035:013 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Go H1980 (8800) and tell H0559 (8804) the men H0376 of Judah H3063 and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, Will ye not receive H3947 (8799) instruction H4148 to hearken H8085 (8800) to my words H1697? saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
035:014 The words H1697 of Jonadab H3082 the son H1121 of Rechab H7394, that he commanded H6680 (8765) his sons H1121 not to drink H8354 (8800) wine H3196, are performed H6965 (8717); for unto this day H3117 they drink H8354 (8804) none, but obey H8085 (8804) their father’s H0001 commandment H4687: notwithstanding I have spoken H1696 (8765) unto you, rising early H7925 (8687) and speaking H1696 (8763); but ye hearkened H8085 (8804) not unto me.
035:015 I have sent H7971 (8799) also unto you all my servants H5650 the prophets H5030, rising up early H7925 (8687) and sending H7971 (8800) [them], saying H0559 (8800), Return H7725 (8798) ye now every man H0376 from his evil H7451 way H1870, and amend H3190 (8685) your doings H4611, and go H3212 (8799) not after H0310 other H0312 gods H0430 to serve H5647 (8800) them, and ye shall dwell in H3427 (8798) the land H0127 which I have given H5414 (8804) to you and to your fathers H0001: but ye have not inclined H5186 (8689) your ear H0241, nor hearkened H8085 (8804) unto me.
035:016 Because the sons H1121 of Jonadab H3082 the son H1121 of Rechab H7394 have performed H6965 (8689) the commandment H4687 of their father H0001, which he commanded H6680 (8765) them; but this people H5971 hath not hearkened H8085 (8804) unto me:
035:017 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) upon Judah H3063 and upon all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 all the evil H7451 that I have pronounced H1696 (8765) against them: because I have spoken H1696 (8765) unto them, but they have not heard H8085 (8804); and I have called H7121 (8799) unto them, but they have not answered H6030 (8804).
035:018 And Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8804) unto the house H1004 of the Rechabites H7397, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Because ye have obeyed H8085 (8804) the commandment H4687 of Jonadab H3082 your father H0001, and kept H8104 (8799) all his precepts H4687, and done H6213 (8799) according unto all that he hath commanded H6680 (8765) you:
035:019 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Jonadab H3122 the son H1121 of Rechab H7394 shall not want H3772 (8735) a man H0376 to stand H5975 (8802) before H6440 me for ever H3117.
036:001 ¶  And it came to pass in the fourth H7243 year H8141 of Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063, [that] this word H1697 came unto Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
036:002 Take H3947 (8798) thee a roll H4039 of a book H5612, and write H3789 (8804) therein all the words H1697 that I have spoken H1696 (8765) unto thee against Israel H3478, and against Judah H3063, and against all the nations H1471, from the day H3117 I spake H1696 (8765) unto thee, from the days H3117 of Josiah H2977, even unto this day H3117.
036:003 It may be that the house H1004 of Judah H3063 will hear H8085 (8799) all the evil H7451 which I purpose H2803 (8802) to do H6213 (8800) unto them; that they may return H7725 (8799) every man H0376 from his evil H7451 way H1870; that I may forgive H5545 (8804) their iniquity H5771 and their sin H2403.
036:004 Then Jeremiah H3414 called H7121 (8799) Baruch H1263 the son H1121 of Neriah H5374: and Baruch H1263 wrote H3789 (8799) from the mouth H6310 of Jeremiah H3414 all the words H1697 of the LORD H3068, which he had spoken H1696 (8765) unto him, upon a roll H4039 of a book H5612.
036:005 And Jeremiah H3414 commanded H6680 (8762) Baruch H1263, saying H0559 (8800), I [am] shut up H6113 (8803); I cannot H3201 (8799) go H0935 (8800) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068:
036:006 Therefore go H0935 (8804) thou, and read H7121 (8804) in the roll H4039, which thou hast written H3789 (8804) from my mouth H6310, the words H1697 of the LORD H3068 in the ears H0241 of the people H5971 in the LORD’S H3068 house H1004 upon the fasting H6685 day H3117: and also thou shalt read H7121 (8799) them in the ears H0241 of all Judah H3063 that come out H0935 (8802) of their cities H5892.
036:007 It may be they will present H5307 (8799) their supplication H8467 before H6440 the LORD H3068, and will return H7725 (8799) every one H0376 from his evil H7451 way H1870: for great H1419 [is] the anger H0639 and the fury H2534 that the LORD H3068 hath pronounced H1696 (8765) against this people H5971.
036:008 And Baruch H1263 the son H1121 of Neriah H5374 did H6213 (8799) according to all that Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 commanded H6680 (8765) him, reading H7121 (8800) in the book H5612 the words H1697 of the LORD H3068 in the LORD’S H3068 house H1004.
036:009 And it came to pass in the fifth H2549 year H8141 of Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063, in the ninth H8671 month H2320, [that] they proclaimed H7121 (8804) a fast H6685 before H6440 the LORD H3068 to all the people H5971 in Jerusalem H3389, and to all the people H5971 that came H0935 (8802) from the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 unto Jerusalem H3389.
036:010 Then read H7121 (8799) Baruch H1263 in the book H5612 the words H1697 of Jeremiah H3414 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, in the chamber H3957 of Gemariah H1587 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227 the scribe H5608 (8802), in the higher H5945 court H2691, at the entry H6607 of the new H2319 gate H8179 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004, in the ears H0241 of all the people H5971.
036:011 When Michaiah H4321 the son H1121 of Gemariah H1587, the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, had heard H8085 (8799) out of the book H5612 all the words H1697 of the LORD H3068,
036:012 Then he went down H3381 (8799) into the king’s H4428 house H1004, into the scribe’s H5608 (8802) chamber H3957: and, lo, all the princes H8269 sat H3427 (8802) there, [even] Elishama H0476 the scribe H5608 (8802), and Delaiah H1806 the son H1121 of Shemaiah H8098, and Elnathan H0494 the son H1121 of Achbor H5907, and Gemariah H1587 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, and Zedekiah H6667 the son H1121 of Hananiah H2608, and all the princes H8269.
036:013 Then Michaiah H4321 declared H5046 (8686) unto them all the words H1697 that he had heard H8085 (8804), when Baruch H1263 read H7121 (8800) the book H5612 in the ears H0241 of the people H5971.
036:014 Therefore all the princes H8269 sent H7971 (8799) Jehudi H3065 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418, the son H1121 of Shelemiah H8018, the son H1121 of Cushi H3570, unto Baruch H1263, saying H0559 (8800), Take H3947 (8798) in thine hand H3027 the roll H4039 wherein thou hast read H7121 (8804) in the ears H0241 of the people H5971, and come H3212 (8798). So Baruch H1263 the son H1121 of Neriah H5374 took H3947 (8799) the roll H4039 in his hand H3027, and came H0935 (8799) unto them.
036:015 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Sit down H3427 (8798) now, and read H7121 (8798) it in our ears H0241. So Baruch H1263 read H7121 (8799) [it] in their ears H0241.
036:016 Now it came to pass, when they had heard H8085 (8800) all the words H1697, they were afraid H6342 (8804) both H0413 one H0376 and other H7453, and said H0559 (8799) unto Baruch H1263, We will surely H5046 (8687) tell H5046 (8686) the king H4428 of all these words H1697.
036:017 And they asked H7592 (8804) Baruch H1263, saying H0559 (8800), Tell H5046 (8685) us now, How didst thou write H3789 (8804) all these words H1697 at his mouth H6310?
036:018 Then Baruch H1263 answered H0559 (8799) them, He pronounced H7121 (8799) all these words H1697 unto me with his mouth H6310, and I wrote H3789 (8802) [them] with ink H1773 in the book H5612.
036:019 Then said H0559 (8799) the princes H8269 unto Baruch H1263, Go H3212 (8798), hide H5641 (8734) thee, thou and Jeremiah H3414; and let no man H0376 know H3045 (8799) where H0375 ye be.
036:020 And they went in H0935 (8799) to the king H4428 into the court H2691, but they laid up H6485 (8689) the roll H4039 in the chamber H3957 of Elishama H0476 the scribe H5608 (8802), and told H5046 (8686) all the words H1697 in the ears H0241 of the king H4428.
036:021 So the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799) Jehudi H3065 to fetch H3947 (8800) the roll H4039: and he took H3947 (8799) it out of Elishama H0476 the scribe’s H5608 (8802) chamber H3957. And Jehudi H3065 read H7121 (8799) it in the ears H0241 of the king H4428, and in the ears H0241 of all the princes H8269 which stood H5975 (8802) beside H5921 the king H4428.
036:022 Now the king H4428 sat H3427 (8802) in the winterhouse H1004 H2779 in the ninth H8671 month H2320: and [there was a fire] on the hearth H0254 burning H1197 (8794) before H6440 him.
036:023 And it came to pass, [that] when Jehudi H3065 had read H7121 (8800) three H7969 or four H0702 leaves H1817, he cut H7167 (8799) it with the penknife H8593 H5608 (8802), and cast H7993 (8687) [it] into the fire H0784 that [was] on the hearth H0254, until all the roll H4039 was consumed H8552 (8800) in the fire H0784 that [was] on the hearth H0254.
036:024 Yet they were not afraid H6342 (8804), nor rent H7167 (8804) their garments H0899, [neither] the king H4428, nor any of his servants H5650 that heard H8085 (8802) all these words H1697.
036:025 Nevertheless Elnathan H0494 and Delaiah H1806 and Gemariah H1587 had made intercession H6293 (8689) to the king H4428 that he would not burn H8313 (8800) the roll H4039: but he would not hear H8085 (8804) them.
036:026 But the king H4428 commanded H6680 (8762) Jerahmeel H3396 the son H1121 of Hammelech H4429, and Seraiah H8304 the son H1121 of Azriel H5837, and Shelemiah H8018 the son H1121 of Abdeel H5655, to take H3947 (8800) Baruch H1263 the scribe H5608 (8802) and Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030: but the LORD H3068 hid H5641 (8686) them.
036:027 Then the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to Jeremiah H3414, after H0310 that the king H4428 had burned H8313 (8800) the roll H4039, and the words H1697 which Baruch H1263 wrote H3789 (8804) at the mouth H6310 of Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800),
036:028 Take H3947 (8798) thee again H7725 (8798) another H0312 roll H4039, and write H3789 (8798) in it all the former H7223 words H1697 that were in the first H7223 roll H4039, which Jehoiakim H3079 the king H4428 of Judah H3063 hath burned H8313 (8804).
036:029 And thou shalt say H0559 (8799) to Jehoiakim H3079 king H4428 of Judah H3063, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Thou hast burned H8313 (8804) this roll H4039, saying H0559 (8800), Why hast thou written H3789 (8804) therein, saying H0559 (8800), The king H4428 of Babylon H0894 shall certainly H0935 (8800) come H0935 (8799) and destroy H7843 (8689) this land H0776, and shall cause to cease H7673 (8689) from thence man H0120 and beast H0929?
036:030 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of Jehoiakim H3079 king H4428 of Judah H3063; He shall have none to sit H3427 (8802) upon the throne H3678 of David H1732: and his dead body H5038 shall be cast out H7993 (8716) in the day H3117 to the heat H2721, and in the night H3915 to the frost H7140.
036:031 And I will punish H6485 (8804) him and his seed H2233 and his servants H5650 for their iniquity H5771; and I will bring H0935 (8689) upon them, and upon the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, and upon the men H0376 of Judah H3063, all the evil H7451 that I have pronounced H1696 (8765) against them; but they hearkened H8085 (8804) not.
036:032 Then took H3947 (8804) Jeremiah H3414 another H0312 roll H4039, and gave H5414 (8799) it to Baruch H1263 the scribe H5608 (8802), the son H1121 of Neriah H5374; who wrote H3789 (8799) therein from the mouth H6310 of Jeremiah H3414 all the words H1697 of the book H5612 which Jehoiakim H3079 king H4428 of Judah H3063 had burned H8313 (8804) in the fire H0784: and there were added H3254 (8738) besides unto them many H7227 like H1992 words H1697.
037:001 ¶  And king H4428 Zedekiah H6667 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 reigned H4427 (8799) instead of Coniah H3659 the son H1121 of Jehoiakim H3079, whom Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 made king H4427 (8689) in the land H0776 of Judah H3063.
037:002 But neither he, nor his servants H5650, nor the people H5971 of the land H0776, did hearken H8085 (8804) unto the words H1697 of the LORD H3068, which he spake H1696 (8765) by H3027 the prophet H5030 Jeremiah H3414.
037:003 And Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799) Jehucal H3081 the son H1121 of Shelemiah H8018 and Zephaniah H6846 the son H1121 of Maaseiah H4641 the priest H3548 to the prophet H5030 Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800), Pray H6419 (8690) now unto the LORD H3068 our God H0430 for us.
037:004 Now Jeremiah H3414 came in H0935 (8804) and went out H3318 (8802) among H8432 the people H5971: for they had not put H5414 (8804) him into prison H1004 H3628.
037:005 Then Pharaoh’s H6547 army H2428 was come forth H3318 (8804) out of Egypt H4714: and when the Chaldeans H3778 that besieged H6696 (8802) Jerusalem H3389 heard H8085 (8799) tidings H8088 of them, they departed H5927 (8735) from Jerusalem H3389.
037:006 Then came the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 unto the prophet H5030 Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800),
037:007 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Thus shall ye say H0559 (8799) to the king H4428 of Judah H3063, that sent H7971 (8802) you unto me to enquire H1875 (8800) of me; Behold, Pharaoh’s H6547 army H2428, which is come forth H3318 (8802) to help H5833 you, shall return H7725 (8804) to Egypt H4714 into their own land H0776.
037:008 And the Chaldeans H3778 shall come again H7725 (8804), and fight H3898 (8738) against this city H5892, and take H3920 (8804) it, and burn H8313 (8804) it with fire H0784.
037:009 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Deceive H5377 (8686) not yourselves H5315, saying H0559 (8800), The Chaldeans H3778 shall surely H1980 (8800) depart H3212 (8799) from us: for they shall not depart H3212 (8799).
037:010 For though ye had smitten H5221 (8689) the whole army H2428 of the Chaldeans H3778 that fight H3898 (8737) against you, and there remained H7604 (8738) [but] wounded H1856 (8794) men H0582 among them, [yet] should they rise up H6965 (8799) every man H0376 in his tent H0168, and burn H8313 (8804) this city H5892 with fire H0784.
037:011 And it came to pass, that when the army H2428 of the Chaldeans H3778 was broken up H5927 (8736) from Jerusalem H3389 for fear H6440 of Pharaoh’s H6547 army H2428,
037:012 Then Jeremiah H3414 went forth H3318 (8799) out of Jerusalem H3389 to go H3212 (8800) into the land H0776 of Benjamin H1144, to separate H2505 (8687) himself thence in the midst H8432 of the people H5971.
037:013 And when he was in the gate H8179 of Benjamin H1144, a captain H1167 of the ward H6488 [was] there, whose name H8034 [was] Irijah H3376, the son H1121 of Shelemiah H8018, the son H1121 of Hananiah H2608; and he took H8610 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030, saying H0559 (8800), Thou fallest away H5307 (8802) to the Chaldeans H3778.
037:014 Then said H0559 (8799) Jeremiah H3414, [It is] false H8267; I fall not away H5307 (8802) to the Chaldeans H3778. But he hearkened H8085 (8804) not to him: so Irijah H3376 took H8610 (8799) Jeremiah H3414, and brought H0935 (8686) him to the princes H8269.
037:015 Wherefore the princes H8269 were wroth H7107 (8799) with Jeremiah H3414, and smote H5221 (8689) him, and put H5414 (8804) him in prison H0612 in the house H1004 of Jonathan H3083 the scribe H5608 (8802): for they had made H6213 (8804) that the prison H3608.
037:016 When Jeremiah H3414 was entered H0935 (8804) into the dungeon H1004 H0953, and into the cabins H2588, and Jeremiah H3414 had remained H3427 (8799) there many H7227 days H3117;
037:017 Then Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799), and took him out H3947 (8799): and the king H4428 asked H7592 (8799) him secretly H5643 in his house H1004, and said H0559 (8799), Is there [any] word H1697 from the LORD H3068? And Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799), There is H3426: for, said H0559 (8799) he, thou shalt be delivered H5414 (8735) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894.
037:018 Moreover Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799) unto king H4428 Zedekiah H6667, What have I offended H2398 (8804) against thee, or against thy servants H5650, or against this people H5971, that ye have put H5414 (8804) me in prison H1004 H3608?
037:019 Where [are] now H0346 your prophets H5030 which prophesied H5012 (8738) unto you, saying H0559 (8800), The king H4428 of Babylon H0894 shall not come H0935 (8799) against you, nor against this land H0776?
037:020 Therefore hear H8085 (8798) now, I pray thee, O my lord H0113 the king H4428: let my supplication H8467, I pray thee, be accepted H5307 (8799) before H6440 thee; that thou cause me not to return H7725 (8686) to the house H1004 of Jonathan H3083 the scribe H5608 (8802), lest I die H4191 (8799) there.
037:021 Then Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 commanded H6680 (8762) that they should commit H6485 (8686) Jeremiah H3414 into the court H2691 of the prison H4307, and that they should give H5414 (8800) him daily H3117 a piece H3603 of bread H3899 out of the bakers H0644 (8802) ’ street H2351, until all the bread H3899 in the city H5892 were spent H8552 (8800). Thus Jeremiah H3414 remained H3427 (8799) in the court H2691 of the prison H4307.
038:001 ¶  Then Shephatiah H8203 the son H1121 of Mattan H4977, and Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Pashur H6583, and Jucal H3116 the son H1121 of Shelemiah H8018, and Pashur H6583 the son H1121 of Malchiah H4441, heard H8085 (8799) the words H1697 that Jeremiah H3414 had spoken H1696 (8764) unto all the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800),
038:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, He that remaineth H3427 (8802) in this city H5892 shall die H4191 (8799) by the sword H2719, by the famine H7458, and by the pestilence H1698: but he that goeth forth H3318 (8802) to the Chaldeans H3778 shall live H2421 (8804); for he shall have his life H5315 for a prey H7998, and shall live H2421 (8799) (8675) H2425 (8804).
038:003 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, This city H5892 shall surely H5414 (8736) be given H5414 (8735) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon’s H0894 army H2428, which shall take H3920 (8804) it.
038:004 Therefore the princes H8269 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428, We beseech thee, let this man H0376 be put to death H4191 (8714): for thus H3651 he weakeneth H7503 (8764) the hands H3027 of the men H0582 of war H4421 that remain H7604 (8737) in this city H5892, and the hands H3027 of all the people H5971, in speaking H1696 (8763) such words H1697 unto them: for this man H0376 seeketh H1875 (8802) not the welfare H7965 of this people H5971, but the hurt H7451.
038:005 Then Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), Behold, he [is] in your hand H3027: for the king H4428 [is] not [he that] can H3201 (8799) do [any] thing H1697 against you.
038:006 Then took H3947 (8799) they Jeremiah H3414, and cast H7993 (8686) him into the dungeon H0953 of Malchiah H4441 the son H1121 of Hammelech H4428, that [was] in the court H2691 of the prison H4307: and they let down H7971 (8762) Jeremiah H3414 with cords H2256. And in the dungeon H0953 [there was] no water H4325, but mire H2916: so Jeremiah H3414 sunk H2883 (8799) in the mire H2916.
038:007 Now when Ebedmelech H5663 the Ethiopian H3569, one H0376 of the eunuchs H5631 which was in the king’s H4428 house H1004, heard H8085 (8799) that they had put H5414 (8804) Jeremiah H3414 in the dungeon H0953; the king H4428 then sitting H3427 (8802) in the gate H8179 of Benjamin H1144;
038:008 Ebedmelech H5663 went forth H3318 (8799) out of the king’s H4428 house H1004, and spake H1696 (8762) to the king H4428, saying H0559 (8800),
038:009 My lord H0113 the king H4428, these men H0582 have done evil H7489 (8689) in all that they have done H6213 (8804) to Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030, whom they have cast H7993 (8689) into the dungeon H0953; and he is like to die H4191 (8799) for H6440 hunger H7458 in the place H8478 where he is: for [there is] no more bread H3899 in the city H5892.
038:010 Then the king H4428 commanded H6680 (8762) Ebedmelech H5663 the Ethiopian H3569, saying H0559 (8800), Take H3947 (8798) from hence thirty H7970 men H0582 with thee H3027, and take up H5927 (8689) Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 out of the dungeon H0953, before he die H4191 (8799).
038:011 So Ebedmelech H5663 took H3947 (8799) the men H0582 with him H3027, and went H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of the king H4428 under the treasury H0214, and took H3947 (8799) thence old H1094 cast clouts H5499 and old H1094 rotten rags H4418, and let them down H7971 (8762) by cords H2256 into the dungeon H0953 to Jeremiah H3414.
038:012 And Ebedmelech H5663 the Ethiopian H3569 said H0559 (8799) unto Jeremiah H3414, Put H7760 (8798) now [these] old H1094 cast clouts H5499 and rotten rags H4418 under thine armholes H0679 H3027 under the cords H2256. And Jeremiah H3414 did H6213 (8799) so.
038:013 So they drew up H4900 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 with cords H2256, and took him up H5927 (8686) out of the dungeon H0953: and Jeremiah H3414 remained H3427 (8799) in the court H2691 of the prison H4307.
038:014 Then Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799), and took H3947 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 unto him into the third H7992 entry H3996 that [is] in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: and the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Jeremiah H3414, I will ask H7592 (8802) thee a thing H1697; hide H3582 (8762) nothing from me.
038:015 Then Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799) unto Zedekiah H6667, If I declare H5046 (8686) [it] unto thee, wilt thou not surely H4191 (8687) put me to death H4191 (8686)? and if I give thee counsel H3289 (8799), wilt thou not hearken H8085 (8799) unto me?
038:016 So Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 sware H7650 (8735) secretly H5643 unto Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, that made H6213 (8804) us this soul H5315, I will not put thee to death H4191 (8686), neither will I give H5414 (8799) thee into the hand H3027 of these men H0582 that seek H1245 (8764) thy life H5315.
038:017 Then said H0559 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 unto Zedekiah H6667, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; If thou wilt assuredly H3318 (8800) go forth H3318 (8799) unto the king H4428 of Babylon’s H0894 princes H8269, then thy soul H5315 shall live H2421 (8804), and this city H5892 shall not be burned H8313 (8735) with fire H0784; and thou shalt live H2421 (8804), and thine house H1004:
038:018 But if thou wilt not go forth H3318 (8799) to the king H4428 of Babylon’s H0894 princes H8269, then shall this city H5892 be given H5414 (8738) into the hand H3027 of the Chaldeans H3778, and they shall burn H8313 (8804) it with fire H0784, and thou shalt not escape out H4422 (8735) of their hand H3027.
038:019 And Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto Jeremiah H3414, I am afraid H1672 (8802) of the Jews H3064 that are fallen H5307 (8804) to the Chaldeans H3778, lest they deliver H5414 (8799) me into their hand H3027, and they mock H5953 (8694) me.
038:020 But Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799), They shall not deliver H5414 (8799) [thee]. Obey H8085 (8798), I beseech thee, the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068, which I speak H1696 (8802) unto thee: so it shall be well H3190 (8799) unto thee, and thy soul H5315 shall live H2421 (8799).
038:021 But if thou refuse H3986 to go forth H3318 (8800), this [is] the word H1697 that the LORD H3068 hath shewed H7200 (8689) me:
038:022 And, behold, all the women H0802 that are left H7604 (8738) in the king H4428 of Judah’s H3063 house H1004 [shall be] brought forth H3318 (8716) to the king H4428 of Babylon’s H0894 princes H8269, and those [women] shall say H0559 (8802), Thy friends H0582 H7965 have set thee on H5496 (8689), and have prevailed H3201 (8804) against thee: thy feet H7272 are sunk H2883 (8717) in the mire H1206, [and] they are turned away H5472 (8738) back H0268.
038:023 So they shall bring out H3318 (8688) all thy wives H0802 and thy children H1121 to the Chaldeans H3778: and thou shalt not escape out H4422 (8735) of their hand H3027, but shalt be taken H8610 (8735) by the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894: and thou shalt cause this city H5892 to be burned H8313 (8799) with fire H0784.
038:024 Then said H0559 (8799) Zedekiah H6667 unto Jeremiah H3414, Let no man H0376 know H3045 (8799) of these words H1697, and thou shalt not die H4191 (8799).
038:025 But if the princes H8269 hear H8085 (8799) that I have talked H1696 (8765) with thee, and they come H0935 (8804) unto thee, and say H0559 (8804) unto thee, Declare H5046 (8685) unto us now what thou hast said H1696 (8765) unto the king H4428, hide H3582 (8762) it not from us, and we will not put thee to death H4191 (8686); also what the king H4428 said H1696 (8765) unto thee:
038:026 Then thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, I presented H5307 (8688) my supplication H8467 before H6440 the king H4428, that he would not cause me to return H7725 (8687) to Jonathan’s H3083 house H1004, to die H4191 (8800) there.
038:027 Then came H0935 (8799) all the princes H8269 unto Jeremiah H3414, and asked H7592 (8799) him: and he told H5046 (8686) them according to all these words H1697 that the king H4428 had commanded H6680 (8765). So they left off speaking H2790 (8686) with him; for the matter H1697 was not perceived H8085 (8738).
038:028 So Jeremiah H3414 abode H3427 (8799) in the court H2691 of the prison H4307 until the day H3117 that Jerusalem H3389 was taken H3920 (8738): and he was [there] when Jerusalem H3389 was taken H3920 (8738).
039:001 ¶  In the ninth H8671 year H8141 of Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063, in the tenth H6224 month H2320, came H0935 (8804) Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 and all his army H2428 against Jerusalem H3389, and they besieged H6696 (8799) it.
039:002 [And] in the eleventh H6249 H6240 year H8141 of Zedekiah H6667, in the fourth H7243 month H2320, the ninth H8672 [day] of the month H2320, the city H5892 was broken up H1234 (8717).
039:003 And all the princes H8269 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 came in H0935 (8799), and sat H3427 (8799) in the middle H8432 gate H8179, [even] Nergalsharezer H5371, Samgarnebo H5562, Sarsechim H8310, Rabsaris H7249, Nergalsharezer H5371, Rabmag H7248, with all the residue H7611 of the princes H8269 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894.
039:004 And it came to pass, [that] when Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 of Judah H3063 saw H7200 (8804) them, and all the men H0582 of war H4421, then they fled H1272 (8799), and went forth H3318 (8799) out of the city H5892 by night H3915, by the way H1870 of the king’s H4428 garden H1588, by the gate H8179 betwixt the two walls H2346: and he went out H3318 (8799) the way H1870 of the plain H6160.
039:005 But the Chaldeans H3778 ’ army H2428 pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 them, and overtook H5381 (8686) Zedekiah H6667 in the plains H6160 of Jericho H3405: and when they had taken H3947 (8799) him, they brought him up H5927 (8686) to Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 to Riblah H7247 in the land H0776 of Hamath H2574, where he gave H1696 (8762) judgment H4941 upon him.
039:006 Then the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 slew H7819 (8799) the sons H1121 of Zedekiah H6667 in Riblah H7247 before his eyes H5869: also the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 slew H7819 (8804) all the nobles H2715 of Judah H3063.
039:007 Moreover he put out H5786 (8765) Zedekiah’s H6667 eyes H5869, and bound H0631 (8799) him with chains H5178, to carry H0935 (8687) him to Babylon H0894.
039:008 And the Chaldeans H3778 burned H8313 (8804) the king’s H4428 house H1004, and the houses H1004 of the people H5971, with fire H0784, and brake down H5422 (8804) the walls H2346 of Jerusalem H3389.
039:009 Then Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 carried away captive H1540 (8689) into Babylon H0894 the remnant H3499 of the people H5971 that remained H7604 (8737) in the city H5892, and those that fell away H5307 (8802), that fell H5307 (8804) to him, with the rest H3499 of the people H5971 that remained H7604 (8737).
039:010 But Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 left H7604 (8689) of the poor H1800 of the people H5971, which had nothing H3972, in the land H0776 of Judah H3063, and gave H5414 (8799) them vineyards H3754 and fields H3010 at the same time H3117.
039:011 Now Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 gave charge H6680 (8762) concerning Jeremiah H3414 to H3027 Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876, saying H0559 (8800),
039:012 Take H3947 (8798) him, and look well H5869 H7760 (8798) to him, and do H6213 (8799) him no harm H3972 H7451; but do H6213 (8798) unto him even as he shall say H1696 (8762) unto thee.
039:013 So Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 sent H7971 (8799), and Nebushasban H5021, Rabsaris H7249, and Nergalsharezer H5371, Rabmag H7248, and all the king H4428 of Babylon’s H0894 princes H7227;
039:014 Even they sent H7971 (8799), and took H3947 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 out of the court H2691 of the prison H4307, and committed H5414 (8799) him unto Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, that he should carry H3318 (8687) him home H1004: so he dwelt H3427 (8799) among H8432 the people H5971.
039:015 Now the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto Jeremiah H3414, while he was shut up H6113 (8803) in the court H2691 of the prison H4307, saying H0559 (8800),
039:016 Go H1980 (8800) and speak H0559 (8804) to Ebedmelech H5663 the Ethiopian H3569, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) my words H1697 upon this city H5892 for evil H7451, and not for good H2896; and they shall be [accomplished] in that day H3117 before H6440 thee.
039:017 But I will deliver H5337 (8689) thee in that day H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: and thou shalt not be given H5414 (8735) into the hand H3027 of the men H0582 of whom H6440 thou [art] afraid H3016 (8801).
039:018 For I will surely H4422 (8763) deliver H4422 (8762) thee, and thou shalt not fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719, but thy life H5315 shall be for a prey H7998 unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust H0982 (8804) in me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
040:001 ¶  The word H1697 that came to Jeremiah H3414 from the LORD H3068, after H0310 that Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 had let him go H7971 (8763) from Ramah H7414, when he had taken H3947 (8800) him being bound H0631 (8803) in chains H0246 among H8432 all that were carried away captive H1546 of Jerusalem H3389 and Judah H3063, which were carried away captive H1540 (8716) unto Babylon H0894.
040:002 And the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 took H3947 (8799) Jeremiah H3414, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, The LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath pronounced H1696 (8765) this evil H7451 upon this place H4725.
040:003 Now the LORD H3068 hath brought H0935 (8686) [it], and done H6213 (8799) according as he hath said H1696 (8765): because ye have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068, and have not obeyed H8085 (8804) his voice H6963, therefore this thing H1697 is come upon you.
040:004 And now, behold, I loose H6605 (8765) thee this day H3117 from the chains H0246 which [were] upon thine hand H3027. If it seem good H2896 H5869 unto thee to come H0935 (8800) with me into Babylon H0894, come H0935 (8798); and I will look well H7760 (8799) H5869 unto thee: but if it seem ill H7489 (8804) H5869 unto thee to come H0935 (8800) with me into Babylon H0894, forbear H2308 (8798): behold H7200 (8798), all the land H0776 [is] before H6440 thee: whither it seemeth H0413 good H2896 and convenient H3477 H5869 for thee to go H3212 (8800), thither go H3212 (8798).
040:005 Now while he was not yet gone back H7725 (8799), [he said], Go back H7725 (8798) also to Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, whom the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 hath made governor H6485 (8689) over the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and dwell H3427 (8798) with him among H8432 the people H5971: or go H3212 (8798) wheresoever it seemeth convenient H3477 H5869 unto thee to go H3212 (8800). So the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 gave H5414 (8799) him victuals H0737 and a reward H4864, and let him go H7971 (8762).
040:006 Then went H0935 (8799) Jeremiah H3414 unto Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 to Mizpah H4708; and dwelt H3427 (8799) with him among H8432 the people H5971 that were left H7604 (8737) in the land H0776.
040:007 Now when all the captains H8269 of the forces H2428 which [were] in the fields H7704, [even] they and their men H0582, heard H8085 (8799) that the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 had made Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 governor H6485 (8689) in the land H0776, and had committed H6485 (8689) unto him men H0582, and women H0802, and children H2945, and of the poor H1803 of the land H0776, of them that were not carried away captive H1540 (8717) to Babylon H0894;
040:008 Then they came H0935 (8799) to Gedaliah H1436 to Mizpah H4708, even Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418, and Johanan H3110 and Jonathan H3129 the sons H1121 of Kareah H7143, and Seraiah H8304 the son H1121 of Tanhumeth H8576, and the sons H1121 of Ephai H5778 the Netophathite H5200, and Jezaniah H3153 the son H1121 of a Maachathite H4602, they and their men H0582.
040:009 And Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227 sware H7650 (8735) unto them and to their men H0582, saying H0559 (8800), Fear H3372 (8799) not to serve H5647 (8800) the Chaldeans H3778: dwell in H3427 (8798) the land H0776, and serve H5647 (8798) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and it shall be well H3190 (8799) with you.
040:010 As for me, behold, I will dwell H3427 (8802) at Mizpah H4709 to serve H5975 (8800) H6440 the Chaldeans H3778, which will come H0935 (8799) unto us: but ye, gather H0622 (8798) ye wine H3196, and summer fruits H7019, and oil H8081, and put H7760 (8798) [them] in your vessels H3627, and dwell H3427 (8798) in your cities H5892 that ye have taken H8610 (8804).
040:011 Likewise when all the Jews H3064 that [were] in Moab H4124, and among the Ammonites H5983, and in Edom H0123, and that [were] in all the countries H0776, heard H8085 (8804) that the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 had left H5414 (8804) a remnant H7611 of Judah H3063, and that he had set H6485 (8689) over them Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227;
040:012 Even all the Jews H3064 returned out H7725 (8799) of all places H4725 whither they were driven H5080 (8738), and came H0935 (8799) to the land H0776 of Judah H3063, to Gedaliah H1436, unto Mizpah H4708, and gathered H0622 (8799) wine H3196 and summer fruits H7019 very H3966 much H7235 (8687).
040:013 Moreover Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, and all the captains H8269 of the forces H2428 that [were] in the fields H7704, came H0935 (8804) to Gedaliah H1436 to Mizpah H4708,
040:014 And said H0559 (8799) unto him, Dost thou certainly H3045 (8800) know H3045 (8799) that Baalis H1185 the king H4428 of the Ammonites H1121 H5983 hath sent H7971 (8804) Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418 to slay H5221 (8687) H5315 thee? But Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 believed H0539 (8689) them not.
040:015 Then Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143 spake H0559 (8804) to Gedaliah H1436 in Mizpah H4709 secretly H5643, saying H0559 (8800), Let me go H3212 (8799), I pray thee, and I will slay H5221 (8686) Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418, and no man H0376 shall know H3045 (8799) [it]: wherefore should he slay H5221 (8686) H5315 thee, that all the Jews H3064 which are gathered H6908 (8737) unto thee should be scattered H6327 (8738), and the remnant H7611 in Judah H3063 perish H0006 (8804)?
040:016 But Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 said H0559 (8799) unto Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, Thou shalt not do H6213 (8799) this thing H1697: for thou speakest H1696 (8802) falsely H8267 of Ishmael H3458.
041:001 ¶  Now it came to pass in the seventh H7637 month H2320, [that] Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418 the son H1121 of Elishama H0476, of the seed H2233 royal H4410, and the princes H7227 of the king H4428, even ten H6235 men H0582 with him, came H0935 (8804) unto Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 to Mizpah H4709; and there they did eat H0398 (8799) bread H3899 together H3162 in Mizpah H4708.
041:002 Then arose H6965 (8799) Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418, and the ten H6235 men H0582 that were with him, and smote H5221 (8686) Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227 with the sword H2719, and slew H4191 (8686) him, whom the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 had made governor H6485 (8689) over the land H0776.
041:003 Ishmael H3458 also slew H5221 (8689) all the Jews H3064 that were with him, [even] with Gedaliah H1436, at Mizpah H4709, and the Chaldeans H3778 that were found H4672 (8738) there, [and] the men H0582 of war H4421.
041:004 And it came to pass the second H8145 day H3117 after he had slain H4191 (8687) Gedaliah H1436, and no man H0376 knew H3045 (8804) [it],
041:005 That there came H0935 (8799) certain H0582 from Shechem H7927, from Shiloh H7887, and from Samaria H8111, [even] fourscore H8084 men H0376, having their beards H2206 shaven H1548 (8794), and their clothes H0899 rent H7167 (8803), and having cut H1413 (8706) themselves, with offerings H4503 and incense H3828 in their hand H3027, to bring H0935 (8687) [them] to the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
041:006 And Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418 went forth H3318 (8799) from Mizpah H4709 to meet H7125 (8800) them, weeping H1058 (8802) all along H1980 (8800) as he went H1980 (8802): and it came to pass, as he met H6298 (8800) them, he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Come H0935 (8798) to Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296.
041:007 And it was [so], when they came H0935 (8800) into the midst H8432 of the city H5892, that Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418 slew H7819 (8799) them, [and cast them] into the midst H8432 of the pit H0953, he, and the men H0582 that [were] with him.
041:008 But ten H6235 men H0582 were found H4672 (8738) among them that said H0559 (8799) unto Ishmael H3458, Slay H4191 (8686) us not: for we have H3426 treasures H4301 in the field H7704, of wheat H2406, and of barley H8184, and of oil H8081, and of honey H1706. So he forbare H2308 (8799), and slew H4191 (8689) them not among H8432 their brethren H0251.
041:009 Now the pit H0953 wherein Ishmael H3458 had cast H7993 (8689) all the dead bodies H6297 of the men H0582, whom he had slain H5221 (8689) because H3027 of Gedaliah H1436, [was] it which Asa H0609 the king H4428 had made H6213 (8804) for fear H6440 of Baasha H1201 king H4428 of Israel H3478: [and] Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418 filled H4390 (8765) it with [them that were] slain H2491.
041:010 Then Ishmael H3458 carried away captive H7617 (8799) all the residue H7611 of the people H5971 that [were] in Mizpah H4709, [even] the king’s H4428 daughters H1323, and all the people H5971 that remained H7604 (8737) in Mizpah H4709, whom Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 had committed H6485 (8689) to Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296: and Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418 carried them away captive H7617 (8799), and departed H3212 (8799) to go over H5674 (8800) to the Ammonites H1121 H5983.
041:011 But when Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, and all the captains H8269 of the forces H2428 that [were] with him, heard H8085 (8799) of all the evil H7451 that Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418 had done H6213 (8804),
041:012 Then they took H3947 (8799) all the men H0582, and went H3212 (8799) to fight H3898 (8736) with Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418, and found H4672 (8799) him by the great H7227 waters H4325 that [are] in Gibeon H1391.
041:013 Now it came to pass, [that] when all the people H5971 which [were] with Ishmael H3458 saw H7200 (8800) Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, and all the captains H8269 of the forces H2428 that [were] with him, then they were glad H8055 (8799).
041:014 So all the people H5971 that Ishmael H3458 had carried away captive H7617 (8804) from Mizpah H4709 cast about H5437 (8799) and returned H7725 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) unto Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143.
041:015 But Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418 escaped H4422 (8738) from H6440 Johanan H3110 with eight H8083 men H0582, and went H3212 (8799) to the Ammonites H1121 H5983.
041:016 Then took H3947 (8799) Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, and all the captains H8269 of the forces H2428 that [were] with him, all the remnant H7611 of the people H5971 whom he had recovered H7725 (8689) from Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418, from Mizpah H4709, after H0310 [that] he had slain H5221 (8689) Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296, [even] mighty H1397 men H0582 of war H4421, and the women H0802, and the children H2945, and the eunuchs H5631, whom he had brought again H7725 (8689) from Gibeon H1391:
041:017 And they departed H3212 (8799), and dwelt in H3427 (8799) the habitation H1628 of Chimham H3643, which is by H0681 Bethlehem H1035, to go H3212 (8800) to enter H0935 (8800) into Egypt H4714,
041:018 Because H6440 of the Chaldeans H3778: for they were afraid H3372 (8804) of them, because Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Nethaniah H5418 had slain H5221 (8689) Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296, whom the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 made governor H6485 (8689) in the land H0776.
042:001 ¶  Then all the captains H8269 of the forces H2428, and Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, and Jezaniah H3153 the son H1121 of Hoshaiah H1955, and all the people H5971 from the least H6996 even unto the greatest H1419, came near H5066 (8799),
042:002 And said H0559 (8799) unto Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication H8467 be accepted H5307 (8799) before H6440 thee, and pray H6419 (8690) for us unto the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, [even] for all this remnant H7611; (for we are left H7604 (8738) [but] a few H4592 of many H7235 (8687), as thine eyes H5869 do behold H7200 (8802) us:)
042:003 That the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 may shew H5046 (8686) us the way H1870 wherein we may walk H3212 (8799), and the thing H1697 that we may do H6213 (8799).
042:004 Then Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 said H0559 (8799) unto them, I have heard H8085 (8804) [you]; behold, I will pray H6419 (8693) unto the LORD H3068 your God H0430 according to your words H1697; and it shall come to pass, [that] whatsoever thing H1697 the LORD H3068 shall answer H6030 (8799) you, I will declare H5046 (8686) [it] unto you; I will keep H4513 nothing H1697 back H4513 (8799) from you.
042:005 Then they said H0559 (8804) to Jeremiah H3414, The LORD H3068 be a true H0571 and faithful H0539 (8737) witness H5707 between us, if we do H6213 (8799) not even according to all things H1697 for the which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 shall send H7971 (8799) thee to us.
042:006 Whether [it be] good H2896, or whether [it be] evil H7451, we will obey H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430, to whom we H0580 send H7971 (8802) thee; that it may be well H3190 (8799) with us, when we obey H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430.
042:007 And it came to pass after H7093 ten H6235 days H3117, that the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came unto Jeremiah H3414.
042:008 Then called H7121 (8799) he Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, and all the captains H8269 of the forces H2428 which [were] with him, and all the people H5971 from the least H6996 even to the greatest H1419,
042:009 And said H0559 (8799) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, unto whom ye sent H7971 (8804) me to present H5307 (8687) your supplication H8467 before H6440 him;
042:010 If ye will still H7725 (8800) abide H3427 (8799) in this land H0776, then will I build H1129 (8804) you, and not pull [you] down H2040 (8799), and I will plant H5193 (8804) you, and not pluck [you] up H5428 (8799): for I repent H5162 (8738) me of the evil H7451 that I have done H6213 (8804) unto you.
042:011 Be not afraid H3372 (8799) of H6440 the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, of whom H6440 ye are afraid H3373; be not afraid H3372 (8799) of him, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: for I [am] with you to save H3467 (8687) you, and to deliver H5337 (8687) you from his hand H3027.
042:012 And I will shew H5414 (8799) mercies H7356 unto you, that he may have mercy H7355 (8765) upon you, and cause you to return H7725 (8689) to your own land H0127.
042:013 But if ye say H0559 (8802), We will not dwell H3427 (8799) in this land H0776, neither obey H8085 (8800) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430,
042:014 Saying H0559 (8800), No; but we will go H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, where we shall see H7200 (8799) no war H4421, nor hear H8085 (8799) the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782, nor have hunger H7456 (8799) of bread H3899; and there will we dwell H3427 (8799):
042:015 And now therefore hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, ye remnant H7611 of Judah H3063; Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; If ye wholly H7760 (8800) set H7760 (8799) your faces H6440 to enter H0935 (8800) into Egypt H4714, and go H0935 (8804) to sojourn H1481 (8800) there;
042:016 Then it shall come to pass, [that] the sword H2719, which ye feared H3373, shall overtake H5381 (8686) you there in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and the famine H7458, whereof ye were afraid H1672 (8802), shall follow close H1692 (8799) after H0310 you there in Egypt H4714; and there ye shall die H4191 (8799).
042:017 So shall it be with all the men H0582 that set H7760 (8804) their faces H6440 to go H0935 (8800) into Egypt H4714 to sojourn H1481 (8800) there; they shall die H4191 (8799) by the sword H2719, by the famine H7458, and by the pestilence H1698: and none of them shall remain H8300 or escape H6412 from H6440 the evil H7451 that I will bring H0935 (8688) upon them.
042:018 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; As mine anger H0639 and my fury H2534 hath been poured forth H5413 (8738) upon the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389; so shall my fury H2534 be poured forth H5413 (8799) upon you, when ye shall enter H0935 (8800) into Egypt H4714: and ye shall be an execration H0423, and an astonishment H8047, and a curse H7045, and a reproach H2781; and ye shall see H7200 (8799) this place H4725 no more.
042:019 The LORD H3068 hath said H1696 (8765) concerning you, O ye remnant H7611 of Judah H3063; Go H0935 (8799) ye not into Egypt H4714: know H3045 (8799) certainly H3045 (8800) that I have admonished H5749 (8689) you this day H3117.
042:020 For ye dissembled H8582 (8689) in your hearts H5315, when ye sent H7971 (8804) me unto the LORD H3068 your God H0430, saying H0559 (8800), Pray H6419 (8690) for us unto the LORD H3068 our God H0430; and according unto all that the LORD H3068 our God H0430 shall say H0559 (8799), so declare H5046 (8685) unto us, and we will do H6213 (8804) [it].
042:021 And [now] I have this day H3117 declared H5046 (8686) [it] to you; but ye have not obeyed H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, nor any [thing] for the which he hath sent H7971 (8804) me unto you.
042:022 Now therefore know H3045 (8799) certainly H3045 (8800) that ye shall die H4191 (8799) by the sword H2719, by the famine H7458, and by the pestilence H1698, in the place H4725 whither ye desire H2654 (8804) to go H0935 (8800) [and] to sojourn H1481 (8800).
043:001 ¶  And it came to pass, [that] when Jeremiah H3414 had made an end H3615 (8763) of speaking H1696 (8763) unto all the people H5971 all the words H1697 of the LORD H3068 their God H0430, for which the LORD H3068 their God H0430 had sent H7971 (8804) him to them, [even] all these words H1697,
043:002 Then spake H0559 (8799) Azariah H5838 the son H1121 of Hoshaiah H1955, and Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, and all the proud H2086 men H0582, saying H0559 (8802) unto Jeremiah H3414, Thou speakest H1696 (8764) falsely H8267: the LORD H3068 our God H0430 hath not sent H7971 (8804) thee to say H0559 (8800), Go H0935 (8799) not into Egypt H4714 to sojourn H1481 (8800) there:
043:003 But Baruch H1263 the son H1121 of Neriah H5374 setteth thee on H5496 (8688) against us, for to H4616 deliver H5414 (8800) us into the hand H3027 of the Chaldeans H3778, that they might put us to death H4191 (8687), and carry us away captives H1540 (8687) into Babylon H0894.
043:004 So Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, and all the captains H8269 of the forces H2428, and all the people H5971, obeyed H8085 (8804) not the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068, to dwell H3427 (8800) in the land H0776 of Judah H3063.
043:005 But Johanan H3110 the son H1121 of Kareah H7143, and all the captains H8269 of the forces H2428, took H3947 (8799) all the remnant H7611 of Judah H3063, that were returned H7725 (8804) from all nations H1471, whither they had been driven H5080 (8738), to dwell H1481 (8800) in the land H0776 of Judah H3063;
043:006 [Even] men H1397, and women H0802, and children H2945, and the king’s H4428 daughters H1323, and every person H5315 that Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 had left H3240 (8689) with Gedaliah H1436 the son H1121 of Ahikam H0296 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, and Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030, and Baruch H1263 the son H1121 of Neriah H5374.
043:007 So they came H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: for they obeyed H8085 (8804) not the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068: thus came H0935 (8799) they [even] to Tahpanhes H8471.
043:008 Then came the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 unto Jeremiah H3414 in Tahpanhes H8471, saying H0559 (8800),
043:009 Take H3947 (8798) great H1419 stones H0068 in thine hand H3027, and hide H2934 (8804) them in the clay H4423 in the brickkiln H4404, which [is] at the entry H6607 of Pharaoh’s H6547 house H1004 in Tahpanhes H8471, in the sight H5869 of the men H0582 of Judah H3064;
043:010 And say H0559 (8804) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will send H7971 (8802) and take H3947 (8804) Nebuchadrezzar H5019 the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, my servant H5650, and will set H7760 (8804) his throne H3678 upon H4605 these stones H0068 that I have hid H2934 (8804); and he shall spread H5186 (8804) his royal pavilion H8237 over them.
043:011 And when he cometh H0935 (8804), he shall smite H5221 (8689) the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, [and deliver] such [as are] for death H4194 to death H4194; and such [as are] for captivity H7628 to captivity H7628; and such [as are] for the sword H2719 to the sword H2719.
043:012 And I will kindle H3341 (8689) a fire H0784 in the houses H1004 of the gods H0430 of Egypt H4714; and he shall burn H8313 (8804) them, and carry them away captives H7617 (8804): and he shall array H5844 (8804) himself with the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, as a shepherd H7462 (8802) putteth on H5844 (8799) his garment H0899; and he shall go forth H3318 (8804) from thence in peace H7965.
043:013 He shall break H7665 (8765) also the images H4676 of Bethshemesh H1053, that [is] in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714; and the houses H1004 of the gods H0430 of the Egyptians H4714 shall he burn H8313 (8799) with fire H0784.
044:001 ¶  The word H1697 that came to Jeremiah H3414 concerning all the Jews H3064 which dwell H3427 (8802) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, which dwell H3427 (8802) at Migdol H4024, and at Tahpanhes H8471, and at Noph H5297, and in the country H0776 of Pathros H6624, saying H0559 (8800),
044:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Ye have seen H7200 (8804) all the evil H7451 that I have brought H0935 (8689) upon Jerusalem H3389, and upon all the cities H5892 of Judah H3063; and, behold, this day H3117 they [are] a desolation H2723, and no man dwelleth H3427 (8802) therein,
044:003 Because H6440 of their wickedness H7451 which they have committed H6213 (8804) to provoke me to anger H3707 (8687), in that they went H3212 (8800) to burn incense H6999 (8763), [and] to serve H5647 (8800) other H0312 gods H0430, whom they knew H3045 (8804) not, [neither] they, ye, nor your fathers H0001.
044:004 Howbeit I sent H7971 (8799) unto you all my servants H5650 the prophets H5030, rising early H7925 (8687) and sending H7971 (8800) [them], saying H0559 (8800), Oh, do H6213 (8799) not this abominable H8441 thing H1697 that I hate H8130 (8804).
044:005 But they hearkened H8085 (8804) not, nor inclined H5186 (8689) their ear H0241 to turn H7725 (8800) from their wickedness H7451, to burn no incense H6999 (8763) unto other H0312 gods H0430.
044:006 Wherefore my fury H2534 and mine anger H0639 was poured forth H5413 (8799), and was kindled H1197 (8799) in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 and in the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389; and they are wasted H2723 [and] desolate H8077, as at this day H3117.
044:007 Therefore now thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Wherefore commit H6213 (8802) ye [this] great H1419 evil H7451 against your souls H5315, to cut off H3772 (8687) from you man H0376 and woman H0802, child H5768 and suckling H3243 (8802), out H8432 of Judah H3063, to leave H3498 (8687) you none to remain H7611;
044:008 In that ye provoke me unto wrath H3707 (8687) with the works H4639 of your hands H3027, burning incense H6999 (8763) unto other H0312 gods H0430 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, whither ye be gone H0935 (8802) to dwell H1481 (8800), that ye might cut yourselves off H3772 (8687), and that ye might be a curse H7045 and a reproach H2781 among all the nations H1471 of the earth H0776?
044:009 Have ye forgotten H7911 (8804) the wickedness H7451 of your fathers H0001, and the wickedness H7451 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063, and the wickedness H7451 of their wives H0802, and your own wickedness H7451, and the wickedness H7451 of your wives H0802, which they have committed H6213 (8804) in the land H0776 of Judah H3063, and in the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389?
044:010 They are not humbled H1792 (8795) [even] unto this day H3117, neither have they feared H3372 (8804), nor walked H1980 (8804) in my law H8451, nor in my statutes H2708, that I set H5414 (8804) before H6440 you and before H6440 your fathers H0001.
044:011 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will set H7760 (8802) my face H6440 against you for evil H7451, and to cut off H3772 (8687) all Judah H3063.
044:012 And I will take H3947 (8804) the remnant H7611 of Judah H3063, that have set H7760 (8804) their faces H6440 to go H0935 (8800) into the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 to sojourn H1481 (8800) there, and they shall all be consumed H8552 (8804), [and] fall H5307 (8799) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714; they shall [even] be consumed H8552 (8735) by the sword H2719 [and] by the famine H7458: they shall die H4191 (8799), from the least H6996 even unto the greatest H1419, by the sword H2719 and by the famine H7458: and they shall be an execration H0423, [and] an astonishment H8047, and a curse H7045, and a reproach H2781.
044:013 For I will punish H6485 (8804) them that dwell H3427 (8802) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, as I have punished H6485 (8804) Jerusalem H3389, by the sword H2719, by the famine H7458, and by the pestilence H1698:
044:014 So that none of the remnant H7611 of Judah H3063, which are gone H0935 (8802) into the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 to sojourn H1481 (8800) there, shall escape H6412 or remain H8300, that they should return H7725 (8800) into the land H0776 of Judah H3063, to the which they have H5375 (8764) a desire H5315 to return H7725 (8800) to dwell H3427 (8800) there: for none shall return H7725 (8799) but such as shall escape H6405.
044:015 Then all the men H0582 which knew H3045 (8802) that their wives H0802 had burned incense H6999 (8764) unto other H0312 gods H0430, and all the women H0802 that stood by H5975 (8802), a great H1419 multitude H6951, even all the people H5971 that dwelt H3427 (8802) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, in Pathros H6624, answered H6030 (8799) Jeremiah H3414, saying H0559 (8800),
044:016 [As for] the word H1697 that thou hast spoken H1696 (8765) unto us in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, we will not hearken H8085 (8802) unto thee.
044:017 But we will certainly H6213 (8800) do H6213 (8799) whatsoever thing H1697 goeth forth H3318 (8804) out of our own mouth H6310, to burn incense H6999 (8763) unto the queen H4446 of heaven H8064, and to pour out H5258 (8687) drink offerings H5262 unto her, as we have done H6213 (8804), we, and our fathers H0001, our kings H4428, and our princes H8269, in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and in the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389: for [then] had we plenty H7646 (8799) of victuals H3899, and were well H2896, and saw H7200 (8804) no evil H7451.
044:018 But since we left off H2308 (8804) to burn incense H6999 (8763) to the queen H4446 of heaven H8064, and to pour out H5258 (8687) drink offerings H5262 unto her, we have wanted H2637 (8804) all [things], and have been consumed H8552 (8804) by the sword H2719 and by the famine H7458.
044:019 And when we burned incense H6999 (8764) to the queen H4446 of heaven H8064, and poured out H5258 (8687) drink offerings H5262 unto her, did we make H6213 (8804) her cakes H3561 to worship H6087 (8687) her, and pour out H5258 (8687) drink offerings H5262 unto her, without H1107 our men H0582?
044:020 Then Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799) unto all the people H5971, to the men H1397, and to the women H0802, and to all the people H5971 which had given him [that] answer H1697 H6030 (8802), saying H0559 (8800),
044:021 The incense H7002 that ye burned H6999 (8765) in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and in the streets H2351 of Jerusalem H3389, ye, and your fathers H0001, your kings H4428, and your princes H8269, and the people H5971 of the land H0776, did not the LORD H3068 remember H2142 (8804) them, and came H5927 (8799) it [not] into his mind H3820?
044:022 So that the LORD H3068 could H3201 (8799) no longer bear H5375 (8800), because H6440 of the evil H7455 of your doings H4611, [and] because H6440 of the abominations H8441 which ye have committed H6213 (8804); therefore is your land H0776 a desolation H2723, and an astonishment H8047, and a curse H7045, without an inhabitant H3427 (8802), as at this day H3117.
044:023 Because H6440 H0834 ye have burned incense H6999 (8765), and because ye have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068, and have not obeyed H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068, nor walked H1980 (8804) in his law H8451, nor in his statutes H2708, nor in his testimonies H5715; therefore this evil H7451 is happened H7122 (8804) unto you, as at this day H3117.
044:024 Moreover Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799) unto all the people H5971, and to all the women H0802, Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, all Judah H3063 that [are] in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714:
044:025 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800); Ye and your wives H0802 have both spoken H1696 (8762) with your mouths H6310, and fulfilled H4390 (8765) with your hand H3027, saying H0559 (8800), We will surely H6213 (8800) perform H6213 (8799) our vows H5088 that we have vowed H5087 (8804), to burn incense H6999 (8763) to the queen H4446 of heaven H8064, and to pour out H5258 (8687) drink offerings H5262 unto her: ye will surely H6965 (8687) accomplish H6965 (8686) your vows H5088, and surely H6213 (8800) perform H6213 (8799) your vows H5088.
044:026 Therefore hear H8085 (8798) ye the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, all Judah H3063 that dwell H3427 (8802) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714; Behold, I have sworn H7650 (8738) by my great H1419 name H8034, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, that my name H8034 shall no more be named H7121 (8737) in the mouth H6310 of any man H0376 of Judah H3063 in all the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, saying H0559 (8802), The Lord H0136 GOD H3069 liveth H2416.
044:027 Behold, I will watch H8245 (8802) over them for evil H7451, and not for good H2896: and all the men H0376 of Judah H3063 that [are] in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 shall be consumed H8552 (8804) by the sword H2719 and by the famine H7458, until there be an end H3615 (8800) of them.
044:028 Yet a small H4962 number H4557 that escape H6412 the sword H2719 shall return out H7725 (8799) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 into the land H0776 of Judah H3063, and all the remnant H7611 of Judah H3063, that are gone H0935 (8802) into the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 to sojourn H1481 (8800) there, shall know H3045 (8804) whose words H1697 shall stand H6965 (8799), mine, or theirs.
044:029 And this [shall be] a sign H0226 unto you, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I will punish H6485 (8802) you in this place H4725, that ye may know H3045 (8799) that my words H1697 shall surely H6965 (8800) stand H6965 (8799) against you for evil H7451:
044:030 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I will give H5414 (8802) Pharaohhophra H6548 king H4428 of Egypt H4714 into the hand H3027 of his enemies H0341 (8802), and into the hand H3027 of them that seek H1245 (8764) his life H5315; as I gave H5414 (8804) Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063 into the hand H3027 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, his enemy H0341 (8802), and that sought H1245 (8764) his life H5315.
045:001 ¶  The word H1697 that Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 spake H1696 (8765) unto Baruch H1263 the son H1121 of Neriah H5374, when he had written H3789 (8800) these words H1697 in a book H5612 at the mouth H6310 of Jeremiah H3414, in the fourth H7243 year H8141 of Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800),
045:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, unto thee, O Baruch H1263;
045:003 Thou didst say H0559 (8804), Woe H0188 is me now! for the LORD H3068 hath added H3254 (8804) grief H3015 to my sorrow H4341; I fainted H3021 (8804) in my sighing H0585, and I find H4672 (8804) no rest H4496.
045:004 Thus shalt thou say H0559 (8799) unto him, The LORD H3068 saith H0559 (8804) thus; Behold, [that] which I have built H1129 (8804) will I break down H2040 (8802), and that which I have planted H5193 (8804) I will pluck up H5428 (8802), even this whole land H0776.
045:005 And seekest H1245 (8762) thou great things H1419 for thyself? seek H1245 (8762) [them] not: for, behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) evil H7451 upon all flesh H1320, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: but thy life H5315 will I give H5414 (8804) unto thee for a prey H7998 in all places H4725 whither thou goest H3212 (8799).
046:001 ¶  The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 which came to Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 against the Gentiles H1471;
046:002 Against Egypt H4714, against the army H2428 of Pharaohnecho H6549 king H4428 of Egypt H4714, which was by the river H5104 Euphrates H6578 in Carchemish H3751, which Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 smote H5221 (8689) in the fourth H7243 year H8141 of Jehoiakim H3079 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977 king H4428 of Judah H3063.
046:003 Order H6186 (8798) ye the buckler H4043 and shield H6793, and draw near H5066 (8798) to battle H4421.
046:004 Harness H0631 (8798) the horses H5483; and get up H5927 (8798), ye horsemen H6571, and stand forth H3320 (8690) with [your] helmets H3553; furbish H4838 (8798) the spears H7420, [and] put on H3847 (8798) the brigandines H5630.
046:005 Wherefore have I seen H7200 (8804) them dismayed H2844 [and] turned H5472 (8737) away back H0268? and their mighty ones H1368 are beaten down H3807 (8714), and are fled H5127 (8804) apace H4498, and look not back H6437 (8689): [for] fear H4032 [was] round about H5439, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
046:006 Let not the swift H7031 flee away H5127 (8799), nor the mighty man H1368 escape H4422 (8735); they shall stumble H3782 (8804), and fall H5307 (8804) toward the north H6828 by H3027 the river H5104 Euphrates H6578.
046:007 Who [is] this [that] cometh up H5927 (8799) as a flood H2975, whose waters H4325 are moved H1607 (8691) as the rivers H5104?
046:008 Egypt H4714 riseth up H5927 (8799) like a flood H2975, and [his] waters H4325 are moved H1607 (8704) like the rivers H5104; and he saith H0559 (8799), I will go up H5927 (8799), [and] will cover H3680 (8762) the earth H0776; I will destroy H0006 (8686) the city H5892 and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof.
046:009 Come up H5927 (8798), ye horses H5483; and rage H1984 (8703), ye chariots H7393; and let the mighty men H1368 come forth H3318 (8799); the Ethiopians H3568 and the Libyans H6316, that handle H8610 (8802) the shield H4043; and the Lydians H3866, that handle H8610 (8802) [and] bend H1869 (8802) the bow H7198.
046:010 For this [is] the day H3117 of the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635, a day H3117 of vengeance H5360, that he may avenge H5358 (8736) him of his adversaries H6862: and the sword H2719 shall devour H0398 (8804), and it shall be satiate H7646 (8804) and made drunk H7301 (8804) with their blood H1818: for the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635 hath a sacrifice H2077 in the north H6828 country H0776 by the river H5104 Euphrates H6578.
046:011 Go up H5927 (8798) into Gilead H1568, and take H3947 (8798) balm H6875, O virgin H1330, the daughter H1323 of Egypt H4714: in vain H7723 shalt thou use many H7235 (8689) medicines H7499; [for] thou shalt not be cured H8585.
046:012 The nations H1471 have heard H8085 (8804) of thy shame H7036, and thy cry H6682 hath filled H4390 (8804) the land H0776: for the mighty man H1368 hath stumbled H3782 (8804) against the mighty H1368, [and] they are fallen H5307 (8804) both H8147 together H3162.
046:013 The word H1697 that the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) to Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030, how Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 should come H0935 (8800) [and] smite H5221 (8687) the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
046:014 Declare H5046 (8685) ye in Egypt H4714, and publish H8085 (8685) in Migdol H4024, and publish H8085 (8685) in Noph H5297 and in Tahpanhes H8471: say H0559 (8798) ye, Stand fast H3320 (8690), and prepare H3559 (8685) thee; for the sword H2719 shall devour H0398 (8804) round about H5439 thee.
046:015 Why are thy valiant H0047 [men] swept away H5502 (8738)? they stood H5975 (8804) not, because the LORD H3068 did drive H1920 (8804) them.
046:016 He made many H7235 (8689) to fall H3782 (8802), yea, one H0376 fell H5307 (8804) upon another H7453: and they said H0559 (8799), Arise H6965 (8798), and let us go again H7725 (8799) to our own people H5971, and to the land H0776 of our nativity H4138, from H6440 the oppressing H3238 (8802) sword H2719.
046:017 They did cry H7121 (8804) there, Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714 [is but] a noise H7588; he hath passed H5674 (8689) the time appointed H4150.
046:018 [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the King H4428, whose name H8034 [is] the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, Surely as Tabor H8396 [is] among the mountains H2022, and as Carmel H3760 by the sea H3220, [so] shall he come H0935 (8799).
046:019 O thou daughter H1323 dwelling H3427 (8802) in Egypt H4714, furnish H6213 (8798) thyself to go into captivity H3627 H1473: for Noph H5297 shall be waste H8047 and desolate H3341 (8738) without an inhabitant H3427 (8802).
046:020 Egypt H4714 [is like] a very fair H3304 heifer H5697, [but] destruction H7171 cometh H0935 (8804); it cometh out H0935 (8804) of the north H6828.
046:021 Also her hired men H7916 [are] in the midst H7130 of her like fatted H4770 bullocks H5695; for they also are turned back H6437 (8689), [and] are fled away H5127 (8804) together H3162: they did not stand H5975 (8804), because the day H3117 of their calamity H0343 was come H0935 (8804) upon them, [and] the time H6256 of their visitation H6486.
046:022 The voice H6963 thereof shall go H3212 (8799) like a serpent H5175; for they shall march H3212 (8799) with an army H2428, and come H0935 (8804) against her with axes H7134, as hewers H2404 (8802) of wood H6086.
046:023 They shall cut down H3772 (8804) her forest H3293, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, though it cannot be searched H2713 (8735); because they are more H7231 (8804) than the grasshoppers H0697, and [are] innumerable H0369 H4557.
046:024 The daughter H1323 of Egypt H4714 shall be confounded H3001 (8689); she shall be delivered H5414 (8738) into the hand H3027 of the people H5971 of the north H6828.
046:025 The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, saith H0559 (8804); Behold, I will punish H6485 (8802) the multitude H0527 (8676) H0528 of No H4996, and Pharaoh H6547, and Egypt H4714, with their gods H0430, and their kings H4428; even Pharaoh H6547, and [all] them that trust H0982 (8802) in him:
046:026 And I will deliver H5414 (8804) them into the hand H3027 of those that seek H1245 (8764) their lives H5315, and into the hand H3027 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and into the hand H3027 of his servants H5650: and afterward H0310 it shall be inhabited H7931 (8799), as in the days H3117 of old H6924, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
046:027 But fear H3372 (8799) not thou, O my servant H5650 Jacob H3290, and be not dismayed H2865 (8735), O Israel H3478: for, behold, I will save H3467 (8688) thee from afar off H7350, and thy seed H2233 from the land H0776 of their captivity H7628; and Jacob H3290 shall return H7725 (8804), and be in rest H8252 (8804) and at ease H7599 (8768), and none shall make [him] afraid H2729 (8688).
046:028 Fear H3372 (8799) thou not, O Jacob H3290 my servant H5650, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: for I [am] with thee; for I will make H6213 (8799) a full end H3617 of all the nations H1471 whither I have driven H5080 (8689) thee: but I will not make H6213 (8799) a full end H3617 of thee, but correct H3256 (8765) thee in measure H4941; yet will I not leave thee wholly H5352 (8763) unpunished H5352 (8762).
047:001 ¶  The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 that came to Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 against the Philistines H6430, before that Pharaoh H6547 smote H5221 (8686) Gaza H5804.
047:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, waters H4325 rise up H5927 (8802) out of the north H6828, and shall be an overflowing H7857 (8802) flood H5158, and shall overflow H7857 (8799) the land H0776, and all that is therein H4393; the city H5892, and them that dwell H3427 (8802) therein: then the men H0120 shall cry H2199 (8804), and all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776 shall howl H3213 (8689).
047:003 At the noise H6963 of the stamping H8161 of the hoofs H6541 of his strong H0047 [horses], at the rushing H7494 of his chariots H7393, [and at] the rumbling H1995 of his wheels H1534, the fathers H0001 shall not look back H6437 (8689) to [their] children H1121 for feebleness H7510 of hands H3027;
047:004 Because of the day H3117 that cometh H0935 (8802) to spoil H7703 (8800) all the Philistines H6430, [and] to cut off H3772 (8687) from Tyrus H6865 and Zidon H6721 every helper H5826 (8802) that remaineth H8300: for the LORD H3068 will spoil H7703 (8802) the Philistines H6430, the remnant H7611 of the country H0339 of Caphtor H3731.
047:005 Baldness H7144 is come H0935 (8804) upon Gaza H5804; Ashkelon H0831 is cut off H1820 (8738) [with] the remnant H7611 of their valley H6010: how long wilt thou cut H1413 (8704) thyself?
047:006 O H1945 thou sword H2719 of the LORD H3068, how long [will it be] ere H3808 thou be quiet H8252 (8799)? put up H0622 (8734) thyself into thy scabbard H8593, rest H7280 (8734), and be still H1826 (8798).
047:007 How can it be quiet H8252 (8799), seeing the LORD H3068 hath given it a charge H6680 (8765) against Ashkelon H0831, and against the sea H3220 shore H2348? there hath he appointed H3259 (8804) it.
048:001 ¶  Against Moab H4124 thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Woe H1945 unto Nebo H5015! for it is spoiled H7703 (8795): Kiriathaim H7156 is confounded H3001 (8689) [and] taken H3920 (8738): Misgab H4869 is confounded H3001 (8689) and dismayed H2865 (8804).
048:002 [There shall be] no more praise H8416 of Moab H4124: in Heshbon H2809 they have devised H2803 (8804) evil H7451 against it; come H3212 (8798), and let us cut it off H3772 (8686) from [being] a nation H1471. Also thou shalt be cut down H1826 (8735), O Madmen H4086; the sword H2719 shall pursue H3212 (8799) thee H0310.
048:003 A voice H6963 of crying H6818 [shall be] from Horonaim H2773, spoiling H7701 and great H1419 destruction H7667.
048:004 Moab H4124 is destroyed H7665 (8738); her little ones H6810 have caused a cry H2201 to be heard H8085 (8689).
048:005 For in the going up H4608 of Luhith H3872 continual H1065 weeping H1065 shall go up H5927 (8799); for in the going down H4174 of Horonaim H2773 the enemies H6862 have heard H8085 (8804) a cry H6818 of destruction H7667.
048:006 Flee H5127 (8798), save H4422 (8761) your lives H5315, and be H1961 (8799) like the heath H6176 in the wilderness H4057.
048:007 For because thou hast trusted H0982 (8800) in thy works H4639 and in thy treasures H0214, thou shalt also be taken H3920 (8735): and Chemosh H3645 shall go forth H3318 (8804) into captivity H1473 [with] his priests H3548 and his princes H8269 together H3162.
048:008 And the spoiler H7703 (8802) shall come H0935 (8799) upon every city H5892, and no city H5892 shall escape H4422 (8735): the valley H6010 also shall perish H0006 (8804), and the plain H4334 shall be destroyed H8045 (8738), as the LORD H3068 hath spoken H0559 (8804).
048:009 Give H5414 (8798) wings H6731 unto Moab H4124, that it may flee H5323 (8800) and get away H3318 (8799): for the cities H5892 thereof shall be desolate H8047, without any to dwell H3427 (8802) therein H2004.
048:010 Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] he that doeth H6213 (8802) the work H4399 of the LORD H3068 deceitfully H7423, and cursed H0779 (8803) [be] he that keepeth back H4513 (8802) his sword H2719 from blood H1818.
048:011 Moab H4124 hath been at ease H7599 (8768) from his youth H5271, and he hath settled H8252 (8802) on his lees H8105, and hath not been emptied H7324 (8717) from vessel H3627 to vessel H3627, neither hath he gone H1980 (8804) into captivity H1473: therefore his taste H2940 remained H5975 (8804) in him, and his scent H7381 is not changed H4171 (8738).
048:012 Therefore, behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I will send H7971 (8765) unto him wanderers H6808 (8802), that shall cause him to wander H6808 (8765), and shall empty H7324 (8686) his vessels H3627, and break H5310 (8762) their bottles H5035.
048:013 And Moab H4124 shall be ashamed H0954 (8804) of Chemosh H3645, as the house H1004 of Israel H3478 was ashamed H0954 (8804) of Bethel H1008 their confidence H4009.
048:014 How say H0559 (8799) ye, We [are] mighty H1368 and strong H2428 men H0582 for the war H4421?
048:015 Moab H4124 is spoiled H7703 (8795), and gone up H5927 (8804) [out of] her cities H5892, and his chosen H4005 young men H0970 are gone down H3381 (8804) to the slaughter H2874, saith H5002 (8803) the King H4428, whose name H8034 [is] the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
048:016 The calamity H0343 of Moab H4124 [is] near H7138 to come H0935 (8800), and his affliction H7451 hasteth H4116 (8765) fast H3966.
048:017 All ye that are about H5439 him, bemoan H5110 (8798) him; and all ye that know H3045 (8802) his name H8034, say H0559 (8798), How is the strong H5797 staff H4294 broken H7665 (8738), [and] the beautiful H8597 rod H4731!
048:018 Thou daughter H1323 that dost inhabit H3427 (8802) Dibon H1769, come down H3381 (8798) from [thy] glory H3519, and sit H3427 (8798) in thirst H6772; for the spoiler H7703 (8802) of Moab H4124 shall come H5927 (8804) upon thee, [and] he shall destroy H7843 (8765) thy strong holds H4013.
048:019 O inhabitant H3427 (8802) of Aroer H6177, stand H5975 (8798) by the way H1870, and espy H6822 (8761); ask H7592 (8798) him that fleeth H5127 (8801), and her that escapeth H4422 (8737), [and] say H0559 (8798), What is done H1961 (8738)?
048:020 Moab H4124 is confounded H3001 (8689); for it is broken down H2865 (8804): howl H3213 (8685) and cry H2199 (8798); tell H5046 (8685) ye it in Arnon H0769, that Moab H4124 is spoiled H7703 (8795),
048:021 And judgment H4941 is come H0935 (8804) upon the plain H4334 country H0776; upon Holon H2473, and upon Jahazah H3096, and upon Mephaath H4158,
048:022 And upon Dibon H1769, and upon Nebo H5015, and upon Bethdiblathaim H1015,
048:023 And upon Kiriathaim H7156, and upon Bethgamul H1014, and upon Bethmeon H1010,
048:024 And upon Kerioth H7152, and upon Bozrah H1224, and upon all the cities H5892 of the land H0776 of Moab H4124, far H7350 or near H7138.
048:025 The horn H7161 of Moab H4124 is cut off H1438 (8738), and his arm H2220 is broken H7665 (8738), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
048:026 Make ye him drunken H7937 (8685): for he magnified H1431 (8689) [himself] against the LORD H3068: Moab H4124 also shall wallow H5606 (8804) in his vomit H6892, and he also shall be in derision H7814.
048:027 For was not Israel H3478 a derision H7814 unto thee? was he found H4672 (8738) among thieves H1590? for since H1767 thou spakest H1697 of him, thou skippedst H5110 (8709) for joy.
048:028 O ye that dwell H3427 (8802) in Moab H4124, leave H5800 (8798) the cities H5892, and dwell H7931 (8798) in the rock H5553, and be like the dove H3123 [that] maketh her nest H7077 (8762) in the sides H5676 of the hole’s H6354 mouth H6310.
048:029 We have heard H8085 (8804) the pride H1347 of Moab H4124, (he is exceeding H3966 proud H1343 ) his loftiness H1363, and his arrogancy H1346, and his pride H1347, and the haughtiness H7312 of his heart H3820.
048:030 I know H3045 (8804) his wrath H5678, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; but [it shall] not [be] so; his lies H0907 shall not so effect H6213 (8804) [it].
048:031 Therefore will I howl H3213 (8686) for Moab H4124, and I will cry out H2199 (8799) for all Moab H4124; [mine heart] shall mourn H1897 (8799) for the men H0582 of Kirheres H7025.
048:032 O vine H1612 of Sibmah H7643, I will weep H1058 (8799) for thee with the weeping H1065 of Jazer H3270: thy plants H5189 are gone over H5674 (8804) the sea H3220, they reach H5060 (8804) [even] to the sea H3220 of Jazer H3270: the spoiler H7703 (8802) is fallen H5307 (8804) upon thy summer fruits H7019 and upon thy vintage H1210.
048:033 And joy H8057 and gladness H1524 is taken H0622 (8738) from the plentiful field H3759, and from the land H0776 of Moab H4124; and I have caused wine H3196 to fail H7673 (8689) from the winepresses H3342: none shall tread H1869 (8799) with shouting H1959; [their] shouting H1959 [shall be] no shouting H1959.
048:034 From the cry H2201 of Heshbon H2809 [even] unto Elealeh H0500, [and even] unto Jahaz H3096, have they uttered H5414 (8804) their voice H6963, from Zoar H6820 [even] unto Horonaim H2773, [as] an heifer H5697 of three years old H7992: for the waters H4325 also of Nimrim H5249 shall be desolate H4923.
048:035 Moreover I will cause to cease H7673 (8689) in Moab H4124, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, him that offereth H5927 (8688) in the high places H1116, and him that burneth incense H6999 (8688) to his gods H0430.
048:036 Therefore mine heart H3820 shall sound H1993 (8799) for Moab H4124 like pipes H2485, and mine heart H3820 shall sound H1993 (8799) like pipes H2485 for the men H0582 of Kirheres H7025: because the riches H3502 [that] he hath gotten H6213 (8804) are perished H0006 (8804).
048:037 For every head H7218 [shall be] bald H7144, and every beard H2206 clipped H1639 (8803): upon all the hands H3027 [shall be] cuttings H1417, and upon the loins H4975 sackcloth H8242.
048:038 [There shall be] lamentation H4553 generally upon all the housetops H1406 of Moab H4124, and in the streets H7339 thereof: for I have broken H7665 (8804) Moab H4124 like a vessel H3627 wherein [is] no pleasure H2656, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
048:039 They shall howl H3213 (8685), [saying], How is it broken down H2865 (8804)! how hath Moab H4124 turned H6437 (8689) the back H6203 with shame H0954 (8804)! so shall Moab H4124 be a derision H7814 and a dismaying H4288 to all them about H5439 him.
048:040 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, he shall fly H1675 (8799) as an eagle H5404, and shall spread H6566 (8804) his wings H3671 over Moab H4124.
048:041 Kerioth H7152 is taken H3920 (8738), and the strong holds H4679 are surprised H8610 (8738), and the mighty men’s H1368 hearts H3820 in Moab H4124 at that day H3117 shall be as the heart H3820 of a woman H0802 in her pangs H6887 (8688).
048:042 And Moab H4124 shall be destroyed H8045 (8738) from [being] a people H5971, because he hath magnified H1431 (8689) [himself] against the LORD H3068.
048:043 Fear H6343, and the pit H6354, and the snare H6341, [shall be] upon thee, O inhabitant H3427 (8802) of Moab H4124, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
048:044 He that fleeth H5127 (8801) (8675) H5211 from H6440 the fear H6343 shall fall H5307 (8799) into the pit H6354; and he that getteth up H5927 (8802) out of the pit H6354 shall be taken H3920 (8735) in the snare H6341: for I will bring H0935 (8686) upon it, [even] upon Moab H4124, the year H8141 of their visitation H6486, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
048:045 They that fled H5127 (8801) stood H5975 (8804) under the shadow H6738 of Heshbon H2809 because of the force H3581: but a fire H0784 shall come forth H3318 (8804) out of Heshbon H2809, and a flame H3852 from the midst H0996 of Sihon H5511, and shall devour H0398 (8799) the corner H6285 of Moab H4124, and the crown of the head H6936 of the tumultuous H7588 ones H1121.
048:046 Woe H0188 be unto thee, O Moab H4124! the people H5971 of Chemosh H3645 perisheth H0006 (8804): for thy sons H1121 are taken H3947 (8795) captives H7628, and thy daughters H1323 captives H7633.
048:047 Yet will I bring again H7725 (8804) the captivity H7622 of Moab H4124 in the latter H0319 days H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068. Thus far H2008 [is] the judgment H4941 of Moab H4124.
049:001 ¶  Concerning the Ammonites H1121 H5983, thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Hath Israel H3478 no sons H1121? hath he no heir H3423 (8802)? why [then] doth their king H4428 inherit H3423 (8804) Gad H1410, and his people H5971 dwell H3427 (8804) in his cities H5892?
049:002 Therefore, behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, that I will cause an alarm H8643 of war H4421 to be heard H8085 (8689) in Rabbah H7237 of the Ammonites H1121 H5983; and it shall be a desolate H8077 heap H8510, and her daughters H1323 shall be burned H3341 (8799) with fire H0784: then shall Israel H3478 be heir H3423 (8804) unto them that were his heirs H3423 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
049:003 Howl H3213 (8685), O Heshbon H2809, for Ai H5857 is spoiled H7703 (8795): cry H6817 (8798), ye daughters H1323 of Rabbah H7237, gird H2296 (8798) you with sackcloth H8242; lament H5594 (8798), and run to and fro H7751 (8708) by the hedges H1448; for their king H4428 shall go H3212 (8799) into captivity H1473, [and] his priests H3548 and his princes H8269 together H3162.
049:004 Wherefore gloriest H1984 (8691) thou in the valleys H6010, thy flowing H2100 (8802) valley H6010, O backsliding H7728 daughter H1323? that trusted H0982 (8802) in her treasures H0214, [saying], Who shall come H0935 (8799) unto me?
049:005 Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) a fear H6343 upon thee, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635, from all those that be about H5439 thee; and ye shall be driven out H5080 (8738) every man H0376 right forth H6440; and none shall gather up H6908 (8764) him that wandereth H5074 (8802).
049:006 And afterward H0310 I will bring again H7725 (8686) the captivity H7622 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
049:007 Concerning Edom H0123, thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; [Is] wisdom H2451 no more in Teman H8487? is counsel H6098 perished H0006 (8804) from the prudent H0995 (8801)? is their wisdom H2451 vanished H5628 (8738)?
049:008 Flee H5127 (8798) ye, turn back H6437 (8717), dwell H3427 (8800) deep H6009 (8689), O inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Dedan H1719; for I will bring H0935 (8689) the calamity H0343 of Esau H6215 upon him, the time H6256 [that] I will visit H6485 (8804) him.
049:009 If grapegatherers H1219 (8802) come H0935 (8804) to thee, would they not leave H7604 (8686) [some] gleaning grapes H5955? if thieves H1590 by night H3915, they will destroy H7843 (8689) till they have enough H1767.
049:010 But I have made Esau H6215 bare H2834 (8804), I have uncovered H1540 (8765) his secret places H4565, and he shall not be able H3201 (8799) to hide H2247 (8736) himself: his seed H2233 is spoiled H7703 (8795), and his brethren H0251, and his neighbours H7934, and he [is] not.
049:011 Leave H5800 (8798) thy fatherless children H3490, I will preserve [them] alive H2421 (8762); and let thy widows H0490 trust H0982 (8799) in me.
049:012 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, they whose judgment H4941 [was] not to drink H8354 (8800) of the cup H3563 have assuredly H8354 (8800) drunken H8354 (8799); and [art] thou he [that] shall altogether H5352 (8800) go unpunished H5352 (8735)? thou shalt not go unpunished H5352 (8735), but thou shalt surely H8354 (8800) drink H8354 (8799) [of it].
049:013 For I have sworn H7650 (8738) by myself, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that Bozrah H1224 shall become a desolation H8047, a reproach H2781, a waste H2721, and a curse H7045; and all the cities H5892 thereof shall be perpetual H5769 wastes H2723.
049:014 I have heard H8085 (8804) a rumour H8052 from the LORD H3068, and an ambassador H6735 is sent H7971 (8803) unto the heathen H1471, [saying], Gather ye together H6908 (8690), and come H0935 (8798) against her, and rise up H6965 (8798) to the battle H4421.
049:015 For, lo, I will make H5414 (8804) thee small H6996 among the heathen H1471, [and] despised H0959 (8803) among men H0120.
049:016 Thy terribleness H8606 hath deceived H5377 (8689) thee, [and] the pride H2087 of thine heart H3820, O thou that dwellest H7931 (8802) in the clefts H2288 of the rock H5553, that holdest H8610 (8802) the height H4791 of the hill H1389: though thou shouldest make thy nest H7064 as high H1361 (8686) as the eagle H5404, I will bring thee down H3381 (8686) from thence, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
049:017 Also Edom H0123 shall be a desolation H8047: every one that goeth H5674 (8802) by it shall be astonished H8074 (8799), and shall hiss H8319 (8799) at all the plagues H4347 thereof.
049:018 As in the overthrow H4114 of Sodom H5467 and Gomorrah H6017 and the neighbour H7934 [cities] thereof, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, no man H0376 shall abide H3427 (8799) there, neither shall a son H1121 of man H0120 dwell H1481 (8799) in it.
049:019 Behold, he shall come up H5927 (8799) like a lion H0738 from the swelling H1347 of Jordan H3383 against the habitation H5116 of the strong H0386: but I will suddenly H7280 (8686) make him run away H7323 (8686) from her: and who [is] a chosen H0977 (8803) [man, that] I may appoint H6485 (8799) over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time H3259 (8686)? and who [is] that shepherd H7462 (8802) that will stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 me?
049:020 Therefore hear H8085 (8798) the counsel H6098 of the LORD H3068, that he hath taken H3289 (8804) against Edom H0123; and his purposes H4284, that he hath purposed H2803 (8804) against the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Teman H8487: Surely the least H6810 of the flock H6629 shall draw them out H5498 (8799): surely he shall make their habitations H5116 desolate H8074 (8686) with them.
049:021 The earth H0776 is moved H7493 (8804) at the noise H6963 of their fall H5307 (8800), at the cry H6818 the noise H6963 thereof was heard H8085 (8738) in the Red H5488 sea H3220.
049:022 Behold, he shall come up H5927 (8799) and fly H1675 (8799) as the eagle H5404, and spread H6566 (8799) his wings H3671 over Bozrah H1224: and at that day H3117 shall the heart H3820 of the mighty men H1368 of Edom H0123 be as the heart H3820 of a woman H0802 in her pangs H6887 (8688).
049:023 Concerning Damascus H1834. Hamath H2574 is confounded H0954 (8804), and Arpad H0774: for they have heard H8085 (8804) evil H7451 tidings H8052: they are fainthearted H4127 (8738); [there is] sorrow H1674 on the sea H3220; it cannot H3201 (8799) be quiet H8252 (8687).
049:024 Damascus H1834 is waxed feeble H7503 (8804), [and] turneth H6437 (8689) herself to flee H5127 (8800), and fear H7374 hath seized H2388 (8689) on [her]: anguish H6869 and sorrows H2256 have taken H0270 (8804) her, as a woman in travail H3205 (8802).
049:025 How is the city H5892 of praise H8416 not left H5800 (8795), the city H7151 of my joy H4885!
049:026 Therefore her young men H0970 shall fall H5307 (8799) in her streets H7339, and all the men H0582 of war H4421 shall be cut off H1826 (8735) in that day H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
049:027 And I will kindle H3341 (8689) a fire H0784 in the wall H2346 of Damascus H1834, and it shall consume H0398 (8804) the palaces H0759 of Benhadad H1130.
049:028 Concerning Kedar H6938, and concerning the kingdoms H4467 of Hazor H2674, which Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 shall smite H5221 (8689), thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Arise H6965 (8798) ye, go up H5927 (8798) to Kedar H6938, and spoil H7703 (8798) the men H1121 of the east H6924.
049:029 Their tents H0168 and their flocks H6629 shall they take away H3947 (8799): they shall take H5375 (8799) to themselves their curtains H3407, and all their vessels H3627, and their camels H1581; and they shall cry H7121 (8804) unto them, Fear H4032 [is] on every side H5439.
049:030 Flee H5127 (8798), get H5110 (8798) you far off H3966, dwell H3427 (8800) deep H6009 (8689), O ye inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Hazor H2674, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; for Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 hath taken counsel H6098 H3289 (8804) against you, and hath conceived H2803 (8804) a purpose H4284 against you.
049:031 Arise H6965 (8798), get you up H5927 (8798) unto the wealthy H7961 nation H1471, that dwelleth H3427 (8802) without care H0983, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, which have neither gates H1817 nor bars H1280, [which] dwell H7931 (8799) alone H0910.
049:032 And their camels H1581 shall be a booty H0957, and the multitude H1995 of their cattle H4735 a spoil H7998: and I will scatter H2219 (8765) into all winds H7307 them [that are] in the utmost H7112 (8803) corners H6285; and I will bring H0935 (8686) their calamity H0343 from all sides H5676 thereof, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
049:033 And Hazor H2674 shall be a dwelling H4583 for dragons H8577, [and] a desolation H8077 for H5704 ever H5769: there shall no man H0376 abide H3427 (8799) there, nor [any] son H1121 of man H0120 dwell H1481 (8799) in it.
049:034 The word H1697 of the LORD H3068 that came to Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 against Elam H5867 in the beginning H7225 of the reign H4438 of Zedekiah H6667 king H4428 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800),
049:035 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; Behold, I will break H7665 (8799) the bow H7198 of Elam H5867, the chief H7225 of their might H1369.
049:036 And upon Elam H5867 will I bring H0935 (8689) the four H0702 winds H7307 from the four H0702 quarters H7098 of heaven H8064, and will scatter H2219 (8765) them toward all those winds H7307; and there shall be no nation H1471 whither the outcasts H5080 (8737) of Elam H5867 (8675) H5769 shall not come H0935 (8799).
049:037 For I will cause Elam H5867 to be dismayed H2865 (8689) before H6440 their enemies H0341 (8802), and before H6440 them that seek H1245 (8764) their life H5315: and I will bring H0935 (8689) evil H7451 upon them, [even] my fierce H2740 anger H0639, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; and I will send H7971 (8765) the sword H2719 after H0310 them, till I have consumed H3615 (8763) them:
049:038 And I will set H7760 (8804) my throne H3678 in Elam H5867, and will destroy H0006 (8689) from thence the king H4428 and the princes H8269, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
049:039 But it shall come to pass in the latter H0319 days H3117, [that] I will bring again H7725 (8686) (8675) H7725 (8799) the captivity H7622 (8675) H7622 of Elam H5867, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
050:001 ¶  The word H1697 that the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) against Babylon H0894 [and] against the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778 by H3027 Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030.
050:002 Declare H5046 (8685) ye among the nations H1471, and publish H8085 (8685), and set up H5375 (8798) a standard H5251; publish H8085 (8685), [and] conceal H3582 (8762) not: say H0559 (8798), Babylon H0894 is taken H3920 (8738), Bel H1078 is confounded H3001 (8689), Merodach H4781 is broken in pieces H2865 (8804); her idols H6091 are confounded H3001 (8689), her images H1544 are broken in pieces H2865 (8804).
050:003 For out of the north H6828 there cometh up H5927 (8804) a nation H1471 against her, which shall make H7896 (8799) her land H0776 desolate H8047, and none shall dwell H3427 (8802) therein: they shall remove H5110 (8804), they shall depart H1980 (8804), both man H0120 and beast H0929.
050:004 In those days H3117, and in that time H6256, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, the children H1121 of Israel H3478 shall come H0935 (8799), they and the children H1121 of Judah H3063 together H3162, going H1980 (8800) and weeping H1058 (8800): they shall go H3212 (8799), and seek H1245 (8762) the LORD H3068 their God H0430.
050:005 They shall ask H7592 (8799) the way H1870 to Zion H6726 with their faces H6440 thitherward H2008, [saying], Come H0935 (8798), and let us join H3867 (8738) ourselves to the LORD H3068 in a perpetual H5769 covenant H1285 [that] shall not be forgotten H7911 (8735).
050:006 My people H5971 hath been lost H0006 (8802) sheep H6629: their shepherds H7462 (8802) have caused them to go astray H8582 (8689), they have turned them away H7725 (8790) (8675) H7726 [on] the mountains H2022: they have gone H1980 (8804) from mountain H2022 to hill H1389, they have forgotten H7911 (8804) their restingplace H7258.
050:007 All that found H4672 (8802) them have devoured H0398 (8804) them: and their adversaries H6862 said H0559 (8804), We offend H0816 (8799) not, because they have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068, the habitation H5116 of justice H6664, even the LORD H3068, the hope H4723 of their fathers H0001.
050:008 Remove H5110 (8798) out of the midst H8432 of Babylon H0894, and go forth H3318 (8798) (8675) H3318 (8799) out of the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778, and be as the he goats H6260 before H6440 the flocks H6629.
050:009 For, lo, I will raise H5782 (8688) and cause to come up H5927 (8688) against Babylon H0894 an assembly H6951 of great H1419 nations H1471 from the north H6828 country H0776: and they shall set themselves in array H6186 (8804) against her; from thence she shall be taken H3920 (8735): their arrows H2671 [shall be] as of a mighty H1368 expert man H7919 (8688) (8676) H7921 (8688); none shall return H7725 (8799) in vain H7387.
050:010 And Chaldea H3778 shall be a spoil H7998: all that spoil H7997 (8802) her shall be satisfied H7646 (8799), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
050:011 Because ye were glad H8055 (8799), because ye rejoiced H5937 (8799), O ye destroyers H8154 (8802) of mine heritage H5159, because ye are grown fat H6335 (8799) as the heifer H5697 at grass H1877 (8676) H1758 (8801), and bellow H6670 (8799) as bulls H0047;
050:012 Your mother H0517 shall be sore H3966 confounded H0954 (8804); she that bare H3205 (8802) you shall be ashamed H2659 (8804): behold, the hindermost H0319 of the nations H1471 [shall be] a wilderness H4057, a dry land H6723, and a desert H6160.
050:013 Because of the wrath H7110 of the LORD H3068 it shall not be inhabited H3427 (8799), but it shall be wholly desolate H8077: every one that goeth H5674 (8802) by Babylon H0894 shall be astonished H8074 (8799), and hiss H8319 (8799) at all her plagues H4347.
050:014 Put yourselves in array H6186 (8798) against Babylon H0894 round about H5439: all ye that bend H1869 (8802) the bow H7198, shoot H3034 (8798) at her, spare H2550 (8799) no arrows H2671: for she hath sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068.
050:015 Shout H7321 (8685) against her round about H5439: she hath given H5414 (8804) her hand H3027: her foundations H0803 are fallen H5307 (8804), her walls H2346 are thrown down H2040 (8738): for it [is] the vengeance H5360 of the LORD H3068: take vengeance H5358 (8734) upon her; as she hath done H6213 (8804), do H6213 (8798) unto her.
050:016 Cut off H3772 (8798) the sower H2232 (8802) from Babylon H0894, and him that handleth H8610 (8802) the sickle H4038 in the time H6256 of harvest H7105: for fear H6440 of the oppressing H3238 (8802) sword H2719 they shall turn H6437 (8799) every one H0376 to his people H5971, and they shall flee H5127 (8799) every one H0376 to his own land H0776.
050:017 Israel H3478 [is] a scattered H6340 (8801) sheep H7716; the lions H0738 have driven [him] away H5080 (8689): first H7223 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 hath devoured H0398 (8804) him; and last H0314 this Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 hath broken his bones H6105 (8765).
050:018 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; Behold, I will punish H6485 (8802) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 and his land H0776, as I have punished H6485 (8804) the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
050:019 And I will bring H7725 Israel H3478 again H7725 (8790) to his habitation H5116, and he shall feed H7462 (8804) on Carmel H3760 and Bashan H1316, and his soul H5315 shall be satisfied H7646 (8799) upon mount H2022 Ephraim H0669 and Gilead H1568.
050:020 In those days H3117, and in that time H6256, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, the iniquity H5771 of Israel H3478 shall be sought for H1245 (8792), and [there shall be] none; and the sins H2403 of Judah H3063, and they shall not be found H4672 (8735): for I will pardon H5545 (8799) them whom I reserve H7604 (8686).
050:021 Go up H5927 (8798) against the land H0776 of Merathaim H4850, [even] against it, and against the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Pekod H6489: waste H2717 (8798) and utterly destroy H2763 (8687) after H0310 them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and do H6213 (8798) according to all that I have commanded H6680 (8765) thee.
050:022 A sound H6963 of battle H4421 [is] in the land H0776, and of great H1419 destruction H7667.
050:023 How is the hammer H6360 of the whole earth H0776 cut asunder H1438 (8738) and broken H7665 (8735)! how is Babylon H0894 become a desolation H8047 among the nations H1471!
050:024 I have laid a snare H3369 (8804) for thee, and thou art also taken H3920 (8738), O Babylon H0894, and thou wast not aware H3045 (8804): thou art found H4672 (8738), and also caught H8610 (8738), because thou hast striven H1624 (8694) against the LORD H3068.
050:025 The LORD H3068 hath opened H6605 (8804) his armoury H0214, and hath brought forth H3318 (8686) the weapons H3627 of his indignation H2195: for this [is] the work H4399 of the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635 in the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778.
050:026 Come H0935 (8798) against her from the utmost border H7093, open H6605 (8798) her storehouses H3965: cast her up H5549 (8798) as heaps H6194, and destroy her utterly H2763 (8685): let nothing of her be left H7611.
050:027 Slay H2717 (8798) all her bullocks H6499; let them go down H3381 (8799) to the slaughter H2874: woe H1945 unto them! for their day H3117 is come H0935 (8802), the time H6256 of their visitation H6486.
050:028 The voice H6963 of them that flee H5127 (8801) and escape out H6405 of the land H0776 of Babylon H0894, to declare H5046 (8687) in Zion H6726 the vengeance H5360 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430, the vengeance H5360 of his temple H1964.
050:029 Call together H8085 (8685) the archers H7228 against Babylon H0894: all ye that bend H1869 (8802) the bow H7198, camp H2583 (8798) against it round about H5439; let none thereof escape H6413: recompense H7999 (8761) her according to her work H6467; according to all that she hath done H6213 (8804), do H6213 (8798) unto her: for she hath been proud H2102 (8804) against the LORD H3068, against the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
050:030 Therefore shall her young men H0970 fall H5307 (8799) in the streets H7339, and all her men H0582 of war H4421 shall be cut off H1826 (8735) in that day H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
050:031 Behold, I [am] against thee, [O thou] most proud H2087, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635: for thy day H3117 is come H0935 (8802), the time H6256 [that] I will visit H6485 (8804) thee.
050:032 And the most proud H2087 shall stumble H3782 (8804) and fall H5307 (8804), and none shall raise him up H6965 (8688): and I will kindle H3341 (8689) a fire H0784 in his cities H5892, and it shall devour H0398 (8804) all round about H5439 him.
050:033 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; The children H1121 of Israel H3478 and the children H1121 of Judah H3063 [were] oppressed H6231 (8803) together H3162: and all that took them captives H7617 (8802) held them fast H2388 (8689); they refused H3985 (8765) to let them go H7971 (8763).
050:034 Their Redeemer H1350 (8802) [is] strong H2389; the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] his name H8034: he shall throughly H7378 (8800) plead H7378 (8799) their cause H7379, that he may give rest H7280 (8689) to the land H0776, and disquiet H7264 (8689) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Babylon H0894.
050:035 A sword H2719 [is] upon the Chaldeans H3778, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and upon the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Babylon H0894, and upon her princes H8269, and upon her wise H2450 [men].
050:036 A sword H2719 [is] upon the liars H0907; and they shall dote H2973 (8738): a sword H2719 [is] upon her mighty men H1368; and they shall be dismayed H2865 (8804).
050:037 A sword H2719 [is] upon their horses H5483, and upon their chariots H7393, and upon all the mingled people H6153 that [are] in the midst H8432 of her; and they shall become as women H0802: a sword H2719 [is] upon her treasures H0214; and they shall be robbed H0962 (8795).
050:038 A drought H2721 [is] upon her waters H4325; and they shall be dried up H3001 (8804): for it [is] the land H0776 of graven images H6456, and they are mad H1984 (8704) upon [their] idols H0367.
050:039 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert H6728 with the wild beasts of the islands H0338 shall dwell H3427 (8799) [there], and the owls H1323 H3284 shall dwell H3427 (8804) therein: and it shall be no more inhabited H3427 (8799) for ever H5331; neither shall it be dwelt H7931 (8799) in from generation H1755 to generation H1755.
050:040 As God H0430 overthrew H4114 Sodom H5467 and Gomorrah H6017 and the neighbour H7934 [cities] thereof, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; [so] shall no man H0376 abide H3427 (8799) there, neither shall any son H1121 of man H0120 dwell H1481 (8799) therein.
050:041 Behold, a people H5971 shall come H0935 (8802) from the north H6828, and a great H1419 nation H1471, and many H7227 kings H4428 shall be raised up H5782 (8735) from the coasts H3411 of the earth H0776.
050:042 They shall hold H2388 (8686) the bow H7198 and the lance H3591: they [are] cruel H0394, and will not shew mercy H7355 (8762): their voice H6963 shall roar H1993 (8799) like the sea H3220, and they shall ride H7392 (8799) upon horses H5483, [every one] put in array H6186 (8803), like a man H0376 to the battle H4421, against thee, O daughter H1323 of Babylon H0894.
050:043 The king H4428 of Babylon H0894 hath heard H8085 (8804) the report H8088 of them, and his hands H3027 waxed feeble H7503 (8804): anguish H6869 took hold H2388 (8689) of him, [and] pangs H2427 as of a woman in travail H3205 (8802).
050:044 Behold, he shall come up H5927 (8799) like a lion H0738 from the swelling H1347 of Jordan H3383 unto the habitation H5116 of the strong H0386: but I will make H7323 them suddenly H7280 (8686) run away H7323 (8686) (8675) H7323 (8799) from her: and who [is] a chosen H0977 (8803) [man, that] I may appoint H6485 (8799) over her? for who [is] like me? and who will appoint me the time H3259 (8686)? and who [is] that shepherd H7462 (8802) that will stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 me?
050:045 Therefore hear H8085 (8798) ye the counsel H6098 of the LORD H3068, that he hath taken H3289 (8804) against Babylon H0894; and his purposes H4284, that he hath purposed H2803 (8804) against the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778: Surely the least H6810 of the flock H6629 shall draw them out H5498 (8799): surely he shall make [their] habitation H5116 desolate H8074 (8686) with them.
050:046 At the noise H6963 of the taking H8610 (8738) of Babylon H0894 the earth H0776 is moved H7493 (8735), and the cry H2201 is heard H8085 (8738) among the nations H1471.
051:001 ¶  Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I will raise up H5782 (8688) against Babylon H0894, and against them that dwell H3427 (8802) in the midst H3820 of them that rise up H6965 (8801) against me, a destroying H7843 (8688) wind H7307;
051:002 And will send H7971 (8765) unto Babylon H0894 fanners H2114 (8801), that shall fan H2219 (8765) her, and shall empty H1238 (8787) her land H0776: for in the day H3117 of trouble H7451 they shall be against her round about H5439.
051:003 Against [him that] bendeth H1869 let the archer H1869 (8802) bend H1869 (8799) his bow H7198, and against [him that] lifteth himself up H5927 (8691) in his brigandine H5630: and spare H2550 (8799) ye not her young men H0970; destroy ye utterly H2763 (8685) all her host H6635.
051:004 Thus the slain H2491 shall fall H5307 (8804) in the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778, and [they that are] thrust through H1856 (8794) in her streets H2351.
051:005 For Israel H3478 [hath] not [been] forsaken H0488, nor Judah H3063 of his God H0430, of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; though their land H0776 was filled H4390 (8804) with sin H0817 against the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
051:006 Flee out H5127 (8798) of the midst H8432 of Babylon H0894, and deliver H4422 (8761) every man H0376 his soul H5315: be not cut off H1826 (8735) in her iniquity H5771; for this [is] the time H6256 of the LORD’S H3068 vengeance H5360; he will render H7999 (8764) unto her a recompence H1576.
051:007 Babylon H0894 [hath been] a golden H2091 cup H3563 in the LORD’S H3068 hand H3027, that made all the earth H0776 drunken H7937 (8764): the nations H1471 have drunken H8354 (8804) of her wine H3196; therefore the nations H1471 are mad H1984 (8704).
051:008 Babylon H0894 is suddenly H6597 fallen H5307 (8804) and destroyed H7665 (8735): howl H3213 (8685) for her; take H3947 (8798) balm H6875 for her pain H4341, if so be she may be healed H7495 (8735).
051:009 We would have healed H7495 (8765) Babylon H0894, but she is not healed H7495 (8738): forsake H5800 (8798) her, and let us go H3212 (8799) every one H0376 into his own country H0776: for her judgment H4941 reacheth H5060 (8804) unto heaven H8064, and is lifted up H5375 (8738) [even] to the skies H7834.
051:010 The LORD H3068 hath brought forth H3318 (8689) our righteousness H6666: come H0935 (8798), and let us declare H5608 (8762) in Zion H6726 the work H4639 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430.
051:011 Make bright H1305 (8685) the arrows H2671; gather H4390 (8798) the shields H7982: the LORD H3068 hath raised up H5782 (8689) the spirit H7307 of the kings H4428 of the Medes H4074: for his device H4209 [is] against Babylon H0894, to destroy H7843 (8687) it; because it [is] the vengeance H5360 of the LORD H3068, the vengeance H5360 of his temple H1964.
051:012 Set up H5375 (8798) the standard H5251 upon the walls H2346 of Babylon H0894, make the watch H4929 strong H2388 (8685), set up H6965 (8685) the watchmen H8104 (8802), prepare H3559 (8685) the ambushes H0693 (8802): for the LORD H3068 hath both devised H2161 (8804) and done H6213 (8804) that which he spake H1696 (8765) against the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Babylon H0894.
051:013 O thou that dwellest H7931 (8802) (8675) H7931 (8804) upon many H7227 waters H4325, abundant H7227 in treasures H0214, thine end H7093 is come H0935 (8802), [and] the measure H0520 of thy covetousness H1215.
051:014 The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 hath sworn H7650 (8738) by himself H5315, [saying], Surely I will fill H4390 (8765) thee with men H0120, as with caterpillers H3218; and they shall lift up H6030 (8804) a shout H1959 against thee.
051:015 He hath made H6213 (8802) the earth H0776 by his power H3581, he hath established H3559 (8688) the world H8398 by his wisdom H2451, and hath stretched out H5186 (8804) the heaven H8064 by his understanding H8394.
051:016 When he uttereth H5414 (8800) [his] voice H6963, [there is] a multitude H1995 of waters H4325 in the heavens H8064; and he causeth the vapours H5387 to ascend H5927 (8686) from the ends H7097 of the earth H0776: he maketh H6213 (8804) lightnings H1300 with rain H4306, and bringeth forth H3318 (8686) the wind H7307 out of his treasures H0214.
051:017 Every man H0120 is brutish H1197 (8738) by [his] knowledge H1847; every founder H6884 (8802) is confounded H3001 (8689) by the graven image H6459: for his molten image H5262 [is] falsehood H8267, and [there is] no breath H7307 in them.
051:018 They [are] vanity H1892, the work H4639 of errors H8595: in the time H6256 of their visitation H6486 they shall perish H0006 (8799).
051:019 The portion H2506 of Jacob H3290 [is] not like them; for he [is] the former H3335 (8802) of all things: and [Israel is] the rod H7626 of his inheritance H5159: the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] his name H8034.
051:020 Thou [art] my battle axe H4661 [and] weapons H3627 of war H4421: for with thee will I break in pieces H5310 (8765) the nations H1471, and with thee will I destroy H7843 (8689) kingdoms H4467;
051:021 And with thee will I break in pieces H5310 (8765) the horse H5483 and his rider H7392 (8802); and with thee will I break in pieces H5310 (8765) the chariot H7393 and his rider H7392 (8802);
051:022 With thee also will I break in pieces H5310 (8765) man H0376 and woman H0802; and with thee will I break in pieces H5310 (8765) old H2205 and young H5288; and with thee will I break in pieces H5310 (8765) the young man H0970 and the maid H1330;
051:023 I will also break in pieces H5310 (8765) with thee the shepherd H7462 (8802) and his flock H5739; and with thee will I break in pieces H5310 (8765) the husbandman H0406 and his yoke of oxen H6776; and with thee will I break in pieces H5310 (8765) captains H6346 and rulers H5461.
051:024 And I will render H7999 (8765) unto Babylon H0894 and to all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Chaldea H3778 all their evil H7451 that they have done H6213 (8804) in Zion H6726 in your sight H5869, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
051:025 Behold, I [am] against thee, O destroying H4889 mountain H2022, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, which destroyest H7843 (8688) all the earth H0776: and I will stretch out H5186 (8804) mine hand H3027 upon thee, and roll thee down H1556 (8773) from the rocks H5553, and will make H5414 (8804) thee a burnt H8316 mountain H2022.
051:026 And they shall not take H3947 (8799) of thee a stone H0068 for a corner H6438, nor a stone H0068 for foundations H4146; but thou shalt be desolate H8077 for ever H5769, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
051:027 Set ye up H5375 (8798) a standard H5251 in the land H0776, blow H8628 (8798) the trumpet H7782 among the nations H1471, prepare H6942 (8761) the nations H1471 against her, call together H8085 (8685) against her the kingdoms H4467 of Ararat H0780, Minni H4508, and Ashchenaz H0813; appoint H6485 (8798) a captain H2951 against her; cause the horses H5483 to come up H5927 (8685) as the rough H5569 caterpillers H3218.
051:028 Prepare H6942 (8761) against her the nations H1471 with the kings H4428 of the Medes H4074, the captains H6346 thereof, and all the rulers H5461 thereof, and all the land H0776 of his dominion H4475.
051:029 And the land H0776 shall tremble H7493 (8799) and sorrow H2342 (8799): for every purpose H4284 of the LORD H3068 shall be performed H6965 (8804) against Babylon H0894, to make H7760 (8800) the land H0776 of Babylon H0894 a desolation H8047 without an inhabitant H3427 (8802).
051:030 The mighty men H1368 of Babylon H0894 have forborn H2308 (8804) to fight H3898 (8736), they have remained H3427 (8804) in [their] holds H4679: their might H1369 hath failed H5405 (8804); they became as women H0802: they have burned H3341 (8689) her dwellingplaces H4908; her bars H1280 are broken H7665 (8738).
051:031 One post H7323 (8801) shall run H7323 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) another H7323 (8801), and one messenger H5046 (8688) to meet H7125 (8800) another H5046 (8688), to shew H5046 (8687) the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 that his city H5892 is taken H3920 (8738) at [one] end H7097,
051:032 And that the passages H4569 are stopped H8610 (8738), and the reeds H0098 they have burned H8313 (8804) with fire H0784, and the men H0582 of war H4421 are affrighted H0926 (8738).
051:033 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478; The daughter H1323 of Babylon H0894 [is] like a threshingfloor H1637, [it is] time H6256 to thresh H1869 (8687) her: yet a little while H4592, and the time H6256 of her harvest H7105 shall come H0935 (8804).
051:034 Nebuchadrezzar H5019 the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 hath devoured H0398 (8804) me, he hath crushed H2000 (8804) me, he hath made H3322 (8689) me an empty H7385 vessel H3627, he hath swallowed me up H1104 (8804) like a dragon H8577, he hath filled H4390 (8765) his belly H3770 with my delicates H5730, he hath cast me out H1740 (8689).
051:035 The violence H2555 done to me and to my flesh H7607 [be] upon Babylon H0894, shall the inhabitant H3427 (8802) of Zion H6726 say H0559 (8799); and my blood H1818 upon the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Chaldea H3778, shall Jerusalem H3389 say H0559 (8799).
051:036 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; Behold, I will plead H7378 (8801) thy cause H7379, and take vengeance H5358 (8765) for thee H5360; and I will dry up H2717 (8689) her sea H3220, and make her springs H4726 dry H3001 (8689).
051:037 And Babylon H0894 shall become heaps H1530, a dwellingplace H4583 for dragons H8577, an astonishment H8047, and an hissing H8322, without an inhabitant H3427 (8802).
051:038 They shall roar H7580 (8799) together H3162 like lions H3715: they shall yell H5286 (8804) as lions H0738 ’ whelps H1484.
051:039 In their heat H2527 I will make H7896 (8799) their feasts H4960, and I will make them drunken H7937 (8689), that they may rejoice H5937 (8799), and sleep H3462 (8804) a perpetual H5769 sleep H8142, and not wake H6974 (8686), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
051:040 I will bring them down H3381 (8686) like lambs H3733 to the slaughter H2873 (8800), like rams H0352 with he goats H6260.
051:041 How is Sheshach H8347 taken H3920 (8738)! and how is the praise H8416 of the whole earth H0776 surprised H8610 (8735)! how is Babylon H0894 become an astonishment H8047 among the nations H1471!
051:042 The sea H3220 is come up H5927 (8804) upon Babylon H0894: she is covered H3680 (8738) with the multitude H1995 of the waves H1530 thereof.
051:043 Her cities H5892 are a desolation H8047, a dry H6723 land H0776, and a wilderness H6160, a land H0776 wherein no man H0376 dwelleth H3427 (8799), neither doth [any] son H1121 of man H0120 pass H5674 (8799) thereby H2004.
051:044 And I will punish H6485 (8804) Bel H1078 in Babylon H0894, and I will bring forth H3318 (8689) out of his mouth H6310 that which he hath swallowed up H1105: and the nations H1471 shall not flow together H5102 (8799) any more unto him: yea, the wall H2346 of Babylon H0894 shall fall H5307 (8804).
051:045 My people H5971, go ye out H3318 (8798) of the midst H8432 of her, and deliver H4422 (8761) ye every man H0376 his soul H5315 from the fierce H2740 anger H0639 of the LORD H3068.
051:046 And lest your heart H3824 faint H7401 (8735), and ye fear H3372 (8799) for the rumour H8052 that shall be heard H8085 (8737) in the land H0776; a rumour H8052 shall both come H0935 (8804) [one] year H8141, and after H0310 that in [another] year H8141 [shall come] a rumour H8052, and violence H2555 in the land H0776, ruler H4910 (8802) against ruler H4910 (8802).
051:047 Therefore, behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), that I will do judgment H6485 (8804) upon the graven images H6456 of Babylon H0894: and her whole land H0776 shall be confounded H0954 (8799), and all her slain H2491 shall fall H5307 (8799) in the midst H8432 of her.
051:048 Then the heaven H8064 and the earth H0776, and all that [is] therein, shall sing H7442 (8765) for Babylon H0894: for the spoilers H7703 (8802) shall come H0935 (8799) unto her from the north H6828, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
051:049 As H1571 Babylon H0894 [hath caused] the slain H2491 of Israel H3478 to fall H5307 (8800), so at Babylon H0894 shall fall H5307 (8804) the slain H2491 of all the earth H0776.
051:050 Ye that have escaped H6405 the sword H2719, go away H1980 (8798), stand not still H5975 (8799): remember H2142 (8798) the LORD H3068 afar off H7350, and let Jerusalem H3389 come H5927 (8799) into your mind H3824.
051:051 We are confounded H0954 (8804), because we have heard H8085 (8804) reproach H2781: shame H3639 hath covered H3680 (8765) our faces H6440: for strangers H2114 (8801) are come H0935 (8804) into the sanctuaries H4720 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004.
051:052 Wherefore, behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I will do judgment H6485 (8804) upon her graven images H6456: and through all her land H0776 the wounded H2491 shall groan H0602 (8799).
051:053 Though Babylon H0894 should mount up H5927 (8799) to heaven H8064, and though she should fortify H1219 (8762) the height H4791 of her strength H5797, [yet] H0227 from me shall spoilers H7703 (8802) come H0935 (8799) unto her, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
051:054 A sound H6963 of a cry H2201 [cometh] from Babylon H0894, and great H1419 destruction H7667 from the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778:
051:055 Because the LORD H3068 hath spoiled H7703 (8802) Babylon H0894, and destroyed H0006 (8765) out of her the great H1419 voice H6963; when her waves H1530 do roar H1993 (8804) like great H7227 waters H4325, a noise H7588 of their voice H6963 is uttered H5414 (8738):
051:056 Because the spoiler H7703 (8802) is come H0935 (8804) upon her, [even] upon Babylon H0894, and her mighty men H1368 are taken H3920 (8738), every one of their bows H7198 is broken H2865 (8765): for the LORD H3068 God H0410 of recompences H1578 shall surely H7999 (8763) requite H7999 (8762).
051:057 And I will make drunk H7937 (8689) her princes H8269, and her wise H2450 [men], her captains H6346, and her rulers H5461, and her mighty men H1368: and they shall sleep H3462 (8804) a perpetual H5769 sleep H8142, and not wake H6974 (8686), saith H5002 (8803) the King H4428, whose name H8034 [is] the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
051:058 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; The broad H7342 walls H2346 of Babylon H0894 shall be utterly H6209 (8771) broken H6209 (8698), and her high H1364 gates H8179 shall be burned H3341 (8799) with fire H0784; and the people H5971 shall labour H3021 (8799) in vain H7385, and the folk H3816 in H1767 the fire H0784, and they shall be weary H3286 (8804).
051:059 The word H1697 which Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 commanded H6680 (8765) Seraiah H8304 the son H1121 of Neriah H5374, the son H1121 of Maaseiah H4271, when he went H3212 (8800) with Zedekiah H6667 the king H4428 of Judah H3063 into Babylon H0894 in the fourth H7243 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800). And [this] Seraiah H8304 [was] a quiet H4496 prince H8269.
051:060 So Jeremiah H3414 wrote H3789 (8799) in a H0259 book H5612 all the evil H7451 that should come H0935 (8799) upon Babylon H0894, [even] all these words H1697 that are written H3789 (8803) against Babylon H0894.
051:061 And Jeremiah H3414 said H0559 (8799) to Seraiah H8304, When thou comest H0935 (8800) to Babylon H0894, and shalt see H7200 (8804), and shalt read H7121 (8804) all these words H1697;
051:062 Then shalt thou say H0559 (8804), O LORD H3068, thou hast spoken H1696 (8765) against this place H4725, to cut it off H3772 (8687), that none shall remain H3427 (8802) in it, neither man H0120 nor beast H0929, but that it shall be desolate H8077 for ever H5769.
051:063 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end H3615 (8763) of reading H7121 (8800) this book H5612, [that] thou shalt bind H7194 (8799) a stone H0068 to it, and cast H7993 (8689) it into the midst H8432 of Euphrates H6578:
051:064 And thou shalt say H0559 (8804), Thus shall Babylon H0894 sink H8257 (8799), and shall not rise H6965 (8799) from H6440 the evil H7451 that I will bring H0935 (8688) upon her: and they shall be weary H3286 (8804). Thus far [are] the words H1697 of Jeremiah H3414.
052:001 ¶  Zedekiah H6667 [was] one H0259 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) eleven H0259 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Hamutal H2537 the daughter H1323 of Jeremiah H3414 of Libnah H3841.
052:002 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that Jehoiakim H3079 had done H6213 (8804).
052:003 For through H5921 the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 it came to pass in Jerusalem H3389 and Judah H3063, till he had cast them out H7993 (8687) from his presence H6440, that Zedekiah H6667 rebelled H4775 (8799) against the king H4428 of Babylon H0894.
052:004 And it came to pass in the ninth H8671 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800), in the tenth H6224 month H2320, in the tenth H6218 [day] of the month H2320, [that] Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 came H0935 (8804), he and all his army H2428, against Jerusalem H3389, and pitched H2583 (8799) against it, and built H1129 (8799) forts H1785 against it round about H5439.
052:005 So H0935 (8799) the city H5892 was besieged H4692 unto the eleventh H6249 H6240 year H8141 of king H4428 Zedekiah H6667.
052:006 And in the fourth H7243 month H2320, in the ninth H8672 [day] of the month H2320, the famine H7458 was sore H2388 (8799) in the city H5892, so that there was no bread H3899 for the people H5971 of the land H0776.
052:007 Then the city H5892 was broken up H1234 (8735), and all the men H0582 of war H4421 fled H1272 (8799), and went forth H3318 (8799) out of the city H5892 by night H3915 by the way H1870 of the gate H8179 between the two walls H2346, which [was] by the king’s H4428 garden H1588; (now the Chaldeans H3778 [were] by the city H5892 round about H5439:) and they went H3212 (8799) by the way H1870 of the plain H6160.
052:008 But the army H2428 of the Chaldeans H3778 pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 the king H4428, and overtook H5381 (8686) Zedekiah H6667 in the plains H6160 of Jericho H3405; and all his army H2428 was scattered H6327 (8738) from him.
052:009 Then they took H8610 (8799) the king H4428, and carried him up H5927 (8686) unto the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 to Riblah H7247 in the land H0776 of Hamath H2574; where he gave H1696 (8762) judgment H4941 upon him.
052:010 And the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 slew H7819 (8799) the sons H1121 of Zedekiah H6667 before his eyes H5869: he slew H7819 (8804) also all the princes H8269 of Judah H3063 in Riblah H7247.
052:011 Then he put out H5786 (8765) the eyes H5869 of Zedekiah H6667; and the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 bound H0631 (8799) him in chains H5178, and carried H0935 (8686) him to Babylon H0894, and put H5414 (8799) him in prison H1004 H6486 till the day H3117 of his death H4194.
052:012 Now in the fifth H2549 month H2320, in the tenth H6218 [day] of the month H2320, which [was] the nineteenth H8672 H6240 H8141 year H8141 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, came H0935 (8804) Nebuzaradan H5018, captain H7227 of the guard H2876, [which] served H5975 (8804) H6440 the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, into Jerusalem H3389,
052:013 And burned H8313 (8799) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and the king’s H4428 house H1004; and all the houses H1004 of Jerusalem H3389, and all the houses H1004 of the great H1419 [men], burned H8313 (8804) he with fire H0784:
052:014 And all the army H2428 of the Chaldeans H3778, that [were] with the captain H7227 of the guard H2876, brake down H5422 (8804) all the walls H2346 of Jerusalem H3389 round about H5439.
052:015 Then Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 carried away captive H1540 (8689) [certain] of the poor H1803 of the people H5971, and the residue H3499 of the people H5971 that remained H7604 (8737) in the city H5892, and those that fell away H5307 (8802), that fell H5307 (8804) to the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and the rest H3499 of the multitude H0527.
052:016 But Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 left H7604 (8689) [certain] of the poor H1803 of the land H0776 for vinedressers H3755 and for husbandmen H3009 (8802).
052:017 Also the pillars H5982 of brass H5178 that [were] in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and the bases H4350, and the brasen H5178 sea H3220 that [was] in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, the Chaldeans H3778 brake H7665 (8765), and carried H5375 (8799) all the brass H5178 of them to Babylon H0894.
052:018 The caldrons H5518 also, and the shovels H3257, and the snuffers H4212, and the bowls H4219, and the spoons H3709, and all the vessels H3627 of brass H5178 wherewith they ministered H8334 (8762), took they away H3947 (8804).
052:019 And the basons H5592, and the firepans H4289, and the bowls H4219, and the caldrons H5518, and the candlesticks H4501, and the spoons H3709, and the cups H4518; [that] which [was] of gold H2091 [in] gold H2091, and [that] which [was] of silver H3701 [in] silver H3701, took H3947 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 away H3947 (8804).
052:020 The two H8147 pillars H5982, one H0259 sea H3220, and twelve H8147 H6240 brasen H5178 bulls H1241 that [were] under the bases H4350, which king H4428 Solomon H8010 had made H6213 (8804) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: the brass H5178 of all these vessels H3627 was without weight H4948.
052:021 And [concerning] the pillars H5982, the height H6967 of one H0259 pillar H5982 [was] eighteen H8083 H6240 cubits H0520; and a fillet H2339 of twelve H8147 H6240 cubits H0520 did compass H5437 (8799) it; and the thickness H5672 thereof [was] four H0702 fingers H0676: [it was] hollow H5014 (8803).
052:022 And a chapiter H3805 of brass H5178 [was] upon it; and the height H6967 of one H0259 chapiter H3805 [was] five H2568 cubits H0520, with network H7639 and pomegranates H7416 upon the chapiters H3805 round about H5439, all [of] brass H5178. The second H8145 pillar H5982 also and the pomegranates H7416 [were] like unto these.
052:023 And there were ninety H8673 and six H8337 pomegranates H7416 on a side H7307; [and] all the pomegranates H7416 upon the network H7639 [were] an hundred H3967 round about H5439.
052:024 And the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 took H3947 (8799) Seraiah H8304 the chief H7218 priest H3548, and Zephaniah H6846 the second H4932 priest H3548, and the three H7969 keepers H8104 (8802) of the door H5592:
052:025 He took H3947 (8804) also out of the city H5892 an H0259 eunuch H5631, which had the charge H6496 of the men H0582 of war H4421; and seven H7651 men H0582 of them that were near H7200 (8802) the king’s H4428 person H6440, which were found H4672 (8738) in the city H5892; and the principal H8269 scribe H5608 (8802) of the host H6635, who mustered H6633 (8688) the people H5971 of the land H0776; and threescore H8346 men H0376 of the people H5971 of the land H0776, that were found H4672 (8737) in the midst H8432 of the city H5892.
052:026 So Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 took H3947 (8799) them, and brought H3212 (8686) them to the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 to Riblah H7247.
052:027 And the king H4428 of Babylon H0894 smote H5221 (8686) them, and put them to death H4191 (8686) in Riblah H7247 in the land H0127 of Hamath H2574. Thus Judah H3063 was carried away captive H1540 (8799) out of his own land H0776.
052:028 This [is] the people H5971 whom Nebuchadrezzar H5019 carried away captive H1540 (8689): in the seventh H7651 year H8141 three H7969 thousand H0505 Jews H3064 and three H7969 and twenty H6242:
052:029 In the eighteenth H8083 H6240 year H8141 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 he carried away captive H1540 (8689) from Jerusalem H3389 eight H8083 hundred H3967 thirty H7970 and two H8147 persons H5315:
052:030 In the three H7969 and twentieth H6242 year H8141 of Nebuchadrezzar H5019 Nebuzaradan H5018 the captain H7227 of the guard H2876 carried away captive H1540 (8689) of the Jews H3064 seven H7651 hundred H3967 forty H0705 and five H2568 persons H5315: all the persons H5315 [were] four H0702 thousand H0505 and six H8337 hundred H3967.
052:031 And it came to pass in the seven H7651 and thirtieth H7970 year H8141 of the captivity H1546 of Jehoiachin H3078 king H4428 of Judah H3063, in the twelfth H8147 H6240 month H2320, in the five H2568 and twentieth H6242 [day] of the month H2320, [that] Evilmerodach H0192 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 in the [first] year H8141 of his reign H4438 lifted up H5375 (8804) the head H7218 of Jehoiachin H3078 king H4428 of Judah H3063, and brought him forth H3318 (8686) out of prison H1004 H3628,
052:032 And spake H1696 (8762) kindly H2896 unto him, and set H5414 (8799) his throne H3678 above H4605 the throne H3678 of the kings H4428 that [were] with him in Babylon H0894,
052:033 And changed H8138 (8765) his prison H3608 garments H0899: and he did continually H8548 eat H0398 (8804) bread H3899 before H6440 him all the days H3117 of his life H2416.
052:034 And [for] his diet H0737, there was a continual H8548 diet H0737 given H5414 (8738) him of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, every H3117 day H3117 a portion H1697 until the day H3117 of his death H4194, all the days H3117 of his life H2416.
