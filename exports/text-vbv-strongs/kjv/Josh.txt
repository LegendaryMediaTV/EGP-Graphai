001:001 ¶  Now after H0310 the death H4194 of Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 it came to pass, that the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, Moses H4872 ’ minister H8334 (8764), saying H0559 (8800),
001:002 Moses H4872 my servant H5650 is dead H4191 (8804); now therefore arise H6965 (8798), go over H5674 (8798) this Jordan H3383, thou, and all this people H5971, unto the land H0776 which I do give H5414 (8802) to them, [even] to the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
001:003 Every place H4725 that the sole H3709 of your foot H7272 shall tread upon H1869 (8799), that have I given H5414 (8804) unto you, as I said H1696 (8765) unto Moses H4872.
001:004 From the wilderness H4057 and this Lebanon H3844 even unto the great H1419 river H5104, the river H5104 Euphrates H6578, all the land H0776 of the Hittites H2850, and unto the great H1419 sea H3220 toward the going down H3996 of the sun H8121, shall be your coast H1366.
001:005 There shall not any man H0376 be able to stand H3320 (8691) before H6440 thee all the days H3117 of thy life H2416: as I was with Moses H4872, [so] I will be with thee: I will not fail H7503 (8686) thee, nor forsake H5800 (8799) thee.
001:006 Be strong H2388 (8798) and of a good courage H0553 (8798): for unto this people H5971 shalt thou divide for an inheritance H5157 (8686) the land H0776, which I sware H7650 (8738) unto their fathers H0001 to give H5414 (8800) them.
001:007 Only be thou strong H2388 (8798) and very H3966 courageous H0553 (8798), that thou mayest observe H8104 (8800) to do H6213 (8800) according to all the law H8451, which Moses H4872 my servant H5650 commanded H6680 (8765) thee: turn H5493 (8799) not from it [to] the right hand H3225 or [to] the left H8040, that thou mayest prosper H7919 (8686) whithersoever thou goest H3212 (8799).
001:008 This book H5612 of the law H8451 shall not depart H4185 (8799) out of thy mouth H6310; but thou shalt meditate H1897 (8804) therein day H3119 and night H3915, that thou mayest observe H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) according to all that is written H3789 (8803) therein: for then thou shalt make H6743 thy way H1870 prosperous H6743 (8686), and then thou shalt have good success H7919 (8686).
001:009 Have not I commanded H6680 (8765) thee? Be strong H2388 (8798) and of a good courage H0553 (8798); be not afraid H6206 (8799), neither be thou dismayed H2865 (8735): for the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 [is] with thee whithersoever thou goest H3212 (8799).
001:010 Then Joshua H3091 commanded H6680 (8762) the officers H7860 (8802) of the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800),
001:011 Pass H5674 (8798) through H7130 the host H4264, and command H6680 (8761) the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Prepare H3559 (8685) you victuals H6720; for within three H7969 days H3117 ye shall pass over H5674 (8802) this Jordan H3383, to go in H0935 (8800) to possess H3423 (8800) the land H0776, which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) you to possess H3423 (8800) it.
001:012 And to the Reubenites H7206, and to the Gadites H1425, and to half H2677 the tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519, spake H0559 (8804) Joshua H3091, saying H0559 (8800),
001:013 Remember H2142 (8800) the word H1697 which Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) you, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath given you rest H5117 (8688), and hath given H5414 (8804) you this land H0776.
001:014 Your wives H0802, your little ones H2945, and your cattle H4735, shall remain H3427 (8799) in the land H0776 which Moses H4872 gave H5414 (8804) you on this side H5676 Jordan H3383; but ye shall pass H5674 (8799) before H6440 your brethren H0251 armed H2571, all the mighty H1368 men of valour H2428, and help H5826 (8804) them;
001:015 Until the LORD H3068 have given H5117 your brethren H0251 rest H5117 (8686), as [he hath given] you, and they also have possessed H3423 (8804) the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 giveth H5414 (8802) them: then ye shall return H7725 (8804) unto the land H0776 of your possession H3425, and enjoy H3423 (8804) it, which Moses H4872 the LORD’S H3068 servant H5650 gave H5414 (8804) you on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 toward the sunrising H4217 H8121.
001:016 And they answered H6030 (8799) Joshua H3091, saying H0559 (8800), All that thou commandest H6680 (8765) us we will do H6213 (8799), and whithersoever H0834 thou sendest H7971 (8799) us, we will go H3212 (8799).
001:017 According as we hearkened H8085 (8804) unto Moses H4872 in all things, so will we hearken H8085 (8799) unto thee: only the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 be with thee, as he was with Moses H4872.
001:018 Whosoever H0376 [he be] that doth rebel H4784 (8686) against thy commandment H6310, and will not hearken H8085 (8799) unto thy words H1697 in all that thou commandest H6680 (8762) him, he shall be put to death H4191 (8714): only be strong H2388 (8798) and of a good courage H0553 (8798).
002:001 ¶  And Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126 sent H7971 (8799) out of Shittim H7851 two H8147 men H0582 to spy H7270 (8764) secretly H2791, saying H0559 (8800), Go H3212 (8798) view H7200 (8798) the land H0776, even Jericho H3405. And they went H3212 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) into an harlot’s H2181 (8802) house H0802 H1004, named H8034 Rahab H7343, and lodged H7901 (8799) there.
002:002 And it was told H0559 (8735) the king H4428 of Jericho H3405, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, there came H0935 (8804) men H0582 in hither to night H3915 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 to search out H2658 (8800) the country H0776.
002:003 And the king H4428 of Jericho H3405 sent H7971 (8799) unto Rahab H7343, saying H0559 (8800), Bring forth H3318 (8685) the men H0582 that are come H0935 (8802) to thee, which are entered H0935 (8804) into thine house H1004: for they be come H0935 (8804) to search out H2658 (8800) all the country H0776.
002:004 And the woman H0802 took H3947 (8799) the two H8147 men H0582, and hid H6845 (8799) them, and said H0559 (8799) thus, There came H0935 (8804) men H0582 unto me, but I wist H3045 (8804) not whence H0370 they [were]:
002:005 And it came to pass [about the time] of shutting H5462 (8800) of the gate H8179, when it was dark H2822, that the men H0582 went out H3318 (8804): whither the men H0582 went H1980 (8804) I wot H3045 (8804) not: pursue H7291 (8798) after H0310 them quickly H4118; for ye shall overtake H5381 (8686) them.
002:006 But she had brought them up H5927 (8689) to the roof H1406 of the house, and hid H2934 (8799) them with the stalks H6086 of flax H6593, which she had laid in order H6186 (8803) upon the roof H1406.
002:007 And the men H0582 pursued H7291 (8804) after H0310 them the way H1870 to Jordan H3383 unto the fords H4569: and as soon as they which pursued H7291 (8802) after H0310 them were gone out H3318 (8804), they shut H5462 (8804) the gate H8179.
002:008 And before they were laid down H7901 (8799), she came up H5927 (8804) unto them upon the roof H1406;
002:009 And she said H0559 (8799) unto the men H0582, I know H3045 (8804) that the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8804) you the land H0776, and that your terror H0367 is fallen H5307 (8804) upon us, and that all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776 faint H4127 (8738) because H6440 of you.
002:010 For we have heard H8085 (8804) how the LORD H3068 dried up H3001 (8689) the water H4325 of the Red H5488 sea H3220 for you H6440, when ye came out H3318 (8800) of Egypt H4714; and what ye did H6213 (8804) unto the two H8147 kings H4428 of the Amorites H0567, that [were] on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383, Sihon H5511 and Og H5747, whom ye utterly destroyed H2763 (8689).
002:011 And as soon as we had heard H8085 (8799) [these things], our hearts H3824 did melt H4549 (8735), neither did there remain H6965 (8804) any more courage H7307 in any man H0376, because H6440 of you: for the LORD H3068 your God H0430, he [is] God H0430 in heaven H8064 above H4605, and in earth H0776 beneath.
002:012 Now therefore, I pray you, swear H7650 (8734) unto me by the LORD H3068, since H3588 I have shewed H6213 (8804) you kindness H2617, that ye will also shew H6213 (8804) kindness H2617 unto my father’s H0001 house H1004, and give H5414 (8804) me a true H0571 token H0226:
002:013 And [that] ye will save alive H2421 (8689) my father H0001, and my mother H0517, and my brethren H0251, and my sisters H0269, and all that they have, and deliver H5337 (8689) our lives H5315 from death H4194.
002:014 And the men H0582 answered H0559 (8799) her, Our life H5315 for yours H4191 (8800), if ye utter H5046 (8686) not this our business H1697. And it shall be, when the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8800) us the land H0776, that we will deal H6213 (8804) kindly H2617 and truly H0571 with thee.
002:015 Then she let them down H3381 (8686) by a cord H2256 through H1157 the window H2474: for her house H1004 [was] upon the town H7023 wall H2346, and she dwelt H3427 (8802) upon the wall H2346.
002:016 And she said H0559 (8799) unto them, Get H3212 (8798) you to the mountain H2022, lest the pursuers H7291 (8802) meet H6293 (8799) you; and hide H2247 (8738) yourselves there three H7969 days H3117, until the pursuers H7291 (8802) be returned H7725 (8800): and afterward H0310 may ye go H3212 (8799) your way H1870.
002:017 And the men H0582 said H0559 (8799) unto her, We [will be] blameless H5355 of this thine oath H7621 which thou hast made us swear H7650 (8689).
002:018 Behold, [when] we come H0935 (8802) into the land H0776, thou shalt bind H7194 (8799) this line H8615 of scarlet H8144 thread H2339 in the window H2474 which thou didst let us down by H3381 (8689): and thou shalt bring H0622 (8799) thy father H0001, and thy mother H0517, and thy brethren H0251, and all thy father’s H0001 household H1004, home H1004 unto thee.
002:019 And it shall be, [that] whosoever H0834 shall go out H3318 (8799) of the doors H1817 of thy house H1004 into the street H2351, his blood H1818 [shall be] upon his head H7218, and we [will be] guiltless H5355: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house H1004, his blood H1818 [shall be] on our head H7218, if [any] hand H3027 be upon him.
002:020 And if thou utter H5046 (8686) this our business H1697, then we will be quit H5355 of thine oath H7621 which thou hast made us to swear H7650 (8689).
002:021 And she said H0559 (8799), According unto your words H1697, so [be] it. And she sent them away H7971 (8762), and they departed H3212 (8799): and she bound H7194 (8799) the scarlet H8144 line H8615 in the window H2474.
002:022 And they went H3212 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) unto the mountain H2022, and abode H3427 (8799) there three H7969 days H3117, until the pursuers H7291 (8802) were returned H7725 (8804): and the pursuers H7291 (8802) sought H1245 (8762) [them] throughout all the way H1870, but found H4672 (8804) [them] not.
002:023 So the two H8147 men H0582 returned H7725 (8799), and descended H3381 (8799) from the mountain H2022, and passed over H5674 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) to Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, and told H5608 (8762) him all [things] that befell H4672 (8802) them:
002:024 And they said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, Truly H3588 the LORD H3068 hath delivered H5414 (8804) into our hands H3027 all the land H0776; for even all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the country H0776 do faint H4127 (8738) because H6440 of us.
003:001 ¶  And Joshua H3091 rose early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242; and they removed H5265 (8799) from Shittim H7851, and came H0935 (8799) to Jordan H3383, he and all the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and lodged H3885 (8799) there before they passed over H5674 (8799).
003:002 And it came to pass after H7097 three H7969 days H3117, that the officers H7860 (8802) went H5674 (8799) through H7130 the host H4264;
003:003 And they commanded H6680 (8762) the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), When ye see H7200 (8800) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and the priests H3548 the Levites H3881 bearing H5375 (8802) it, then ye shall remove H5265 (8799) from your place H4725, and go H1980 (8804) after H0310 it.
003:004 Yet there shall be a space H7350 between you and it, about two thousand H0505 cubits H0520 by measure H4060: come not near H7126 (8799) unto it, that ye may know H3045 (8799) the way H1870 by which ye must go H3212 (8799): for ye have not passed H5674 (8804) [this] way H1870 heretofore H8543 H8032.
003:005 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971, Sanctify H6942 (8690) yourselves: for to morrow H4279 the LORD H3068 will do H6213 (8799) wonders H6381 (8737) among H7130 you.
003:006 And Joshua H3091 spake H0559 (8799) unto the priests H3548, saying H0559 (8800), Take up H5375 (8798) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285, and pass over H5674 (8798) before H6440 the people H5971. And they took up H5375 (8799) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285, and went H3212 (8799) before H6440 the people H5971.
003:007 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, This day H3117 will I begin H2490 (8686) to magnify H1431 (8763) thee in the sight H5869 of all Israel H3478, that they may know H3045 (8799) that, as I was with Moses H4872, [so] I will be with thee.
003:008 And thou shalt command H6680 (8762) the priests H3548 that bear H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285, saying H0559 (8800), When ye are come H0935 (8800) to the brink H7097 of the water H4325 of Jordan H3383, ye shall stand still H5975 (8799) in Jordan H3383.
003:009 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, Come hither H5066 (8798), and hear H8085 (8798) the words H1697 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
003:010 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799), Hereby ye shall know H3045 (8799) that the living H2416 God H0410 [is] among H7130 you, and [that] he will without fail H3423 (8687) drive out H3423 (8686) from before H6440 you the Canaanites H3669, and the Hittites H2850, and the Hivites H2340, and the Perizzites H6522, and the Girgashites H1622, and the Amorites H0567, and the Jebusites H2983.
003:011 Behold, the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the Lord H0113 of all the earth H0776 passeth over H5674 (8802) before H6440 you into Jordan H3383.
003:012 Now therefore take H3947 (8798) you twelve H8147 H6240 men H0376 out of the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, out of every H0259 tribe H7626 a man H0376.
003:013 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles H3709 of the feet H7272 of the priests H3548 that bear H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068, the Lord H0113 of all the earth H0776, shall rest H5117 (8800) in the waters H4325 of Jordan H3383, [that] the waters H4325 of Jordan H3383 shall be cut off H3772 (8735) [from] the waters H4325 that come down H3381 (8802) from above H4605; and they shall stand H5975 (8799) upon an H0259 heap H5067.
003:014 And it came to pass, when the people H5971 removed H5265 (8800) from their tents H0168, to pass over H5674 (8800) Jordan H3383, and the priests H3548 bearing H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 before H6440 the people H5971;
003:015 And as they that bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 were come H0935 (8800) unto Jordan H3383, and the feet H7272 of the priests H3548 that bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 were dipped H2881 (8738) in the brim H7097 of the water H4325, (for Jordan H3383 overfloweth H4390 (8804) all his banks H1415 all the time H3117 of harvest H7105,)
003:016 That the waters H4325 which came down H3381 (8802) from above H4605 stood H5975 (8799) [and] rose up H6965 (8804) upon an H0259 heap H5067 very H3966 far H7368 (8687) from the city H5892 Adam H0121, that [is] beside H6654 Zaretan H6891: and those that came down H3381 (8802) toward the sea H3220 of the plain H6160, [even] the salt H4417 sea H3220, failed H8552 (8804), [and] were cut off H3772 (8738): and the people H5971 passed over H5674 (8804) right against Jericho H3405.
003:017 And the priests H3548 that bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 stood H5975 (8799) firm H3559 (8687) on dry ground H2724 in the midst H8432 of Jordan H3383, and all the Israelites H3478 passed over H5674 (8802) on dry ground H2724, until all the people H1471 were passed H5674 clean H8552 (8804) over H5674 (8800) Jordan H3383.
004:001 ¶  And it came to pass, when all the people H1471 were clean H8552 (8804) passed over H5674 (8800) Jordan H3383, that the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, saying H0559 (8800),
004:002 Take H3947 (8798) you twelve H8147 H6240 men H0582 out of the people H5971, out of every H0259 tribe H7626 a man H0376,
004:003 And command H6680 (8761) ye them, saying H0559 (8800), Take H5375 (8798) you hence out of the midst H8432 of Jordan H3383, out of the place where the priests H3548 ’ feet H7272 stood H4673 firm H3559 (8687), twelve H8147 H6240 stones H0068, and ye shall carry them over H5674 (8689) with you, and leave H3240 (8689) them in the lodging place H4411, where ye shall lodge H3885 (8799) this night H3915.
004:004 Then Joshua H3091 called H7121 (8799) the twelve H8147 H6240 men H0376, whom he had prepared H3559 (8689) of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, out of every H0259 tribe H7626 a man H0376:
004:005 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Pass over H5674 (8798) before H6440 the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430 into the midst H8432 of Jordan H3383, and take ye up H7311 (8685) every H0259 man H0376 of you a stone H0068 upon his shoulder H7926, according unto the number H4557 of the tribes H7626 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478:
004:006 That this may be a sign H0226 among H7130 you, [that] when your children H1121 ask H7592 (8799) [their fathers] in time to come H4279, saying H0559 (8800), What [mean] ye by these stones H0068?
004:007 Then ye shall answer H0559 (8804) them, That the waters H4325 of Jordan H3383 were cut off H3772 (8738) before H6440 the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068; when it passed over H5674 (8800) Jordan H3383, the waters H4325 of Jordan H3383 were cut off H3772 (8738): and these stones H0068 shall be for a memorial H2146 unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478 for H5704 ever H5769.
004:008 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8799) so as Joshua H3091 commanded H6680 (8765), and took up H5375 (8799) twelve H8147 H6240 stones H0068 out of the midst H8432 of Jordan H3383, as the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) unto Joshua H3091, according to the number H4557 of the tribes H7626 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and carried them over H5674 (8686) with them unto the place where they lodged H4411, and laid them down H3240 (8686) there.
004:009 And Joshua H3091 set up H6965 (8689) twelve H8147 H6240 stones H0068 in the midst H8432 of Jordan H3383, in the place where the feet H7272 of the priests H3548 which bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 stood H4673: and they are there unto this day H3117.
004:010 For the priests H3548 which bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 stood H5975 (8802) in the midst H8432 of Jordan H3383, until every thing H1697 was finished H8552 (8800) that the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Joshua H3091 to speak H1696 (8763) unto the people H5971, according to all that Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8765) Joshua H3091: and the people H5971 hasted H4116 (8762) and passed over H5674 (8799).
004:011 And it came to pass, when all the people H5971 were clean H8552 (8804) passed over H5674 (8800), that the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 passed over H5674 (8799), and the priests H3548, in the presence H6440 of the people H5971.
004:012 And the children H1121 of Reuben H7205, and the children H1121 of Gad H1410, and half H2677 the tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519, passed over H5674 (8799) armed H2571 before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, as Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8765) unto them:
004:013 About forty H0705 thousand H0505 prepared H2502 (8803) for war H6635 passed over H5674 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068 unto battle H4421, to the plains H6160 of Jericho H3405.
004:014 On that day H3117 the LORD H3068 magnified H1431 (8765) Joshua H3091 in the sight H5869 of all Israel H3478; and they feared H3372 (8799) him, as they feared H3372 (8804) Moses H4872, all the days H3117 of his life H2416.
004:015 And the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, saying H0559 (8800),
004:016 Command H6680 (8761) the priests H3548 that bear H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the testimony H5715, that they come up H5927 (8799) out of Jordan H3383.
004:017 Joshua H3091 therefore commanded H6680 (8762) the priests H3548, saying H0559 (8800), Come ye up H5927 (8798) out of Jordan H3383.
004:018 And it came to pass, when the priests H3548 that bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 were come up H5927 (8800) out of the midst H8432 of Jordan H3383, [and] the soles H3709 of the priests H3548 ’ feet H7272 were lifted up H5423 (8738) unto the dry land H2724, that the waters H4325 of Jordan H3383 returned H7725 (8799) unto their place H4725, and flowed H3212 (8799) over all his banks H1415, as H8543 [they did] before H8032.
004:019 And the people H5971 came up H5927 (8804) out of Jordan H3383 on the tenth H6218 [day] of the first H7223 month H2320, and encamped H2583 (8799) in Gilgal H1537, in the east H4217 border H7097 of Jericho H3405.
004:020 And those twelve H8147 H6240 stones H0068, which they took out H3947 (8804) of Jordan H3383, did Joshua H3091 pitch H6965 (8689) in Gilgal H1537.
004:021 And he spake H0559 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), When your children H1121 shall ask H7592 (8799) their fathers H0001 in time to come H4279, saying H0559 (8800), What [mean] these stones H0068?
004:022 Then ye shall let your children H1121 know H3045 (8689), saying H0559 (8800), Israel H3478 came over H5674 (8804) this Jordan H3383 on dry land H3004.
004:023 For the LORD H3068 your God H0430 dried up H3001 (8689) the waters H4325 of Jordan H3383 from before H6440 you, until ye were passed over H5674 (8800), as the LORD H3068 your God H0430 did H6213 (8804) to the Red H5488 sea H3220, which he dried up H3001 (8689) from before H6440 us, until we were gone over H5674 (8800):
004:024 That all the people H5971 of the earth H0776 might know H3045 (8800) the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068, that it [is] mighty H2389: that ye might fear H3372 (8804) the LORD H3068 your God H0430 for ever H3117.
005:001 ¶  And it came to pass, when all the kings H4428 of the Amorites H0567, which [were] on the side H5676 of Jordan H3383 westward H3220, and all the kings H4428 of the Canaanites H3669, which [were] by the sea H3220, heard H8085 (8800) that the LORD H3068 had dried up H3001 (8689) the waters H4325 of Jordan H3383 from before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, until we were passed over H5674 (8800), that their heart H3824 melted H4549 (8735), neither was there spirit H7307 in them any more, because H6440 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
005:002 At that time H6256 the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804) unto Joshua H3091, Make H6213 (8798) thee sharp H6697 knives H2719, and circumcise H4135 (8798) again H7725 (8798) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 the second time H8145.
005:003 And Joshua H3091 made H6213 (8799) him sharp H6697 knives H2719, and circumcised H4135 (8799) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 at the hill H1389 of the foreskins H6190.
005:004 And this [is] the cause H1697 why Joshua H3091 did circumcise H4135 (8804): All the people H5971 that came out H3318 (8802) of Egypt H4714, [that were] males H2145, [even] all the men H0582 of war H4421, died H4191 (8804) in the wilderness H4057 by the way H1870, after they came out H3318 (8800) of Egypt H4714.
005:005 Now H3588 all the people H5971 that came out H3318 (8802) were circumcised H4135 (8803): but all the people H5971 [that were] born H3209 in the wilderness H4057 by the way H1870 as they came forth H3318 (8800) out of Egypt H4714, [them] they had not circumcised H4135 (8804).
005:006 For the children H1121 of Israel H3478 walked H1980 (8804) forty H0705 years H8141 in the wilderness H4057, till all the people H1471 [that were] men H0582 of war H4421, which came out H3318 (8802) of Egypt H4714, were consumed H8552 (8800), because they obeyed H8085 (8804) not the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068: unto whom the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) that he would not shew H7200 (8687) them the land H0776, which the LORD H3068 sware H7650 (8738) unto their fathers H0001 that he would give H5414 (8800) us, a land H0776 that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706.
005:007 And their children H1121, [whom] he raised up H6965 (8689) in their stead, them Joshua H3091 circumcised H4135 (8804): for they were uncircumcised H6189, because they had not circumcised H4135 (8804) them by the way H1870.
005:008 And it came to pass, when they had done H8552 (8804) circumcising H4135 (8736) all the people H1471, that they abode H3427 (8799) in their places in the camp H4264, till they were whole H2421 (8800).
005:009 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, This day H3117 have I rolled away H1556 (8804) the reproach H2781 of Egypt H4714 from off you. Wherefore the name H8034 of the place H4725 is called H7121 (8799) Gilgal H1537 unto this day H3117.
005:010 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 encamped H2583 (8799) in Gilgal H1537, and kept H6213 (8799) the passover H6453 on the fourteenth H0702 H6240 day H3117 of the month H2320 at even H6153 in the plains H6160 of Jericho H3405.
005:011 And they did eat H0398 (8799) of the old corn H5669 of the land H0776 on the morrow H4283 after the passover H6453, unleavened cakes H4682, and parched H7033 (8803) [corn] in the selfsame H6106 day H3117.
005:012 And the manna H4478 ceased H7673 (8799) on the morrow H4283 after they had eaten H0398 (8800) of the old corn H5669 of the land H0776; neither had the children H1121 of Israel H3478 manna H4478 any more; but they did eat H0398 (8799) of the fruit H8393 of the land H0776 of Canaan H3667 that year H8141.
005:013 And it came to pass, when Joshua H3091 was by Jericho H3405, that he lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869 and looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, there stood H5975 (8802) a man H0376 over against him with his sword H2719 drawn H8025 (8803) in his hand H3027: and Joshua H3091 went H3212 (8799) unto him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, [Art] thou for us, or for our adversaries H6862?
005:014 And he said H0559 (8799), Nay; but [as] captain H8269 of the host H6635 of the LORD H3068 am I now come H0935 (8804). And Joshua H3091 fell H5307 (8799) on his face H6440 to the earth H0776, and did worship H7812 (8691), and said H0559 (8799) unto him, What saith H1696 (8764) my lord H0113 unto his servant H5650?
005:015 And the captain H8269 of the LORD’S H3068 host H6635 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, Loose H5394 (8798) thy shoe H5275 from off thy foot H7272; for the place H4725 whereon thou standest H5975 (8802) [is] holy H6944. And Joshua H3091 did H6213 (8799) so.
006:001 ¶  Now Jericho H3405 was straitly H5462 (8802) shut up H5462 (8794) because H6440 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478: none went out H3318 (8802), and none came in H0935 (8802).
006:002 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, See H7200 (8798), I have given H5414 (8804) into thine hand H3027 Jericho H3405, and the king H4428 thereof, [and] the mighty men H1368 of valour H2428.
006:003 And ye shall compass H5437 (8804) the city H5892, all [ye] men H0582 of war H4421, [and] go round about H5362 (8687) the city H5892 once H6471 H0259. Thus shalt thou do H6213 (8799) six H8337 days H3117.
006:004 And seven H7651 priests H3548 shall bear H5375 (8799) before H6440 the ark H0727 seven H7651 trumpets H7782 of rams’ horns H3104: and the seventh H7637 day H3117 ye shall compass H5437 (8799) the city H5892 seven H7651 times H6471, and the priests H3548 shall blow H8628 (8799) with the trumpets H7782.
006:005 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long H4900 (8800) [blast] with the ram’s H3104 horn H7161, [and] when ye hear H8085 (8800) the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782, all the people H5971 shall shout H7321 (8686) with a great H1419 shout H8643; and the wall H2346 of the city H5892 shall fall down H5307 (8804) flat H8478, and the people H5971 shall ascend up H5927 (8804) every man H0376 straight before him.
006:006 And Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126 called H7121 (8799) the priests H3548, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Take up H5375 (8798) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285, and let seven H7651 priests H3548 bear H5375 (8799) seven H7651 trumpets H7782 of rams’ horns H3104 before H6440 the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068.
006:007 And he said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971, Pass on H5674 (8798), and compass H5437 (8798) the city H5892, and let him that is armed H2502 (8803) pass on H5674 (8799) before H6440 the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068.
006:008 And it came to pass, when Joshua H3091 had spoken H0559 (8800) unto the people H5971, that the seven H7651 priests H3548 bearing H5375 (8802) the seven H7651 trumpets H7782 of rams’ horns H3104 passed on H5674 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and blew H8628 (8804) with the trumpets H7782: and the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 followed H1980 (8802) them H0310.
006:009 And the armed H2502 (8803) men went H1980 (8802) before H6440 the priests H3548 that blew H8628 (8802) (8675) H8628 (8804) with the trumpets H7782, and the rereward H0622 (8764) came H1980 (8802) after H0310 the ark H0727, [the priests] going on H1980 (8800), and blowing H8628 (8800) with the trumpets H7782.
006:010 And Joshua H3091 had commanded H6680 (8765) the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall not shout H7321 (8686), nor make any noise H8085 (8686) with your voice H6963, neither shall [any] word H1697 proceed H3318 (8799) out of your mouth H6310, until the day H3117 I bid H0559 (8800) you shout H7321 (8685); then shall ye shout H7321 (8689).
006:011 So the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 compassed H5437 (8686) the city H5892, going about H5362 (8687) [it] once H6471 H0259: and they came H0935 (8799) into the camp H4264, and lodged H3885 (8799) in the camp H4264.
006:012 And Joshua H3091 rose early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and the priests H3548 took up H5375 (8799) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068.
006:013 And seven H7651 priests H3548 bearing H5375 (8802) seven H7651 trumpets H7782 of rams’ horns H3104 before H6440 the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 went on H1980 (8802) continually H1980 (8800), and blew H8628 (8804) with the trumpets H7782: and the armed men H2502 (8803) went H1980 (8802) before H6440 them; but the rereward H0622 (8764) came H1980 (8802) after H0310 the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068, [the priests] going on H1980 (8800), and blowing H8628 (8800) with the trumpets H7782.
006:014 And the second H8145 day H3117 they compassed H5437 (8799) the city H5892 once H6471 H0259, and returned H7725 (8799) into the camp H4264: so they did H6213 (8804) six H8337 days H3117.
006:015 And it came to pass on the seventh H7637 day H3117, that they rose early H7925 (8686) about the dawning H5927 (8800) of the day H7837, and compassed H5437 (8799) the city H5892 after the same manner H4941 seven H7651 times H6471: only on that day H3117 they compassed H5437 (8804) the city H5892 seven H7651 times H6471.
006:016 And it came to pass at the seventh H7637 time H6471, when the priests H3548 blew H8628 (8804) with the trumpets H7782, Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971, Shout H7321 (8685); for the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8804) you the city H5892.
006:017 And the city H5892 shall be accursed H2764, [even] it, and all that [are] therein, to the LORD H3068: only Rahab H7343 the harlot H2181 (8802) shall live H2421 (8799), she and all that [are] with her in the house H1004, because she hid H2244 (8689) the messengers H4397 that we sent H7971 (8804).
006:018 And ye, in any wise H7535 keep H8104 (8798) [yourselves] from the accursed thing H2764, lest ye make [yourselves] accursed H2763 (8686), when ye take H3947 (8804) of the accursed thing H2764, and make H7760 (8804) the camp H4264 of Israel H3478 a curse H2764, and trouble H5916 (8804) it.
006:019 But all the silver H3701, and gold H2091, and vessels H3627 of brass H5178 and iron H1270, [are] consecrated H6944 unto the LORD H3068: they shall come H0935 (8799) into the treasury H0214 of the LORD H3068.
006:020 So the people H5971 shouted H7321 (8686) when [the priests] blew H8628 (8799) with the trumpets H7782: and it came to pass, when the people H5971 heard H8085 (8800) the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782, and the people H5971 shouted H7321 (8686) with a great H1419 shout H8643, that the wall H2346 fell down flat H5307 (8799), so that the people H5971 went up H5927 (8799) into the city H5892, every man H0376 straight before him, and they took H3920 (8799) the city H5892.
006:021 And they utterly destroyed H2763 (8686) all that [was] in the city H5892, both man H0376 and woman H0802, young H5288 and old H2205, and ox H7794, and sheep H7716, and ass H2543, with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719.
006:022 But Joshua H3091 had said H0559 (8804) unto the two H8147 men H0582 that had spied out H7270 (8764) the country H0776, Go H0935 (8798) into the harlot’s H2181 (8802) house H1004, and bring out H3318 (8685) thence the woman H0802, and all that she hath, as ye sware H7650 (8738) unto her.
006:023 And the young men H5288 that were spies H7270 (8764) went in H0935 (8799), and brought out H3318 (8686) Rahab H7343, and her father H0001, and her mother H0517, and her brethren H0251, and all that she had; and they brought out H3318 (8689) all her kindred H4940, and left H3240 (8686) them without H2351 the camp H4264 of Israel H3478.
006:024 And they burnt H8313 (8804) the city H5892 with fire H0784, and all that [was] therein: only the silver H3701, and the gold H2091, and the vessels H3627 of brass H5178 and of iron H1270, they put H5414 (8804) into the treasury H0214 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
006:025 And Joshua H3091 saved H2421 Rahab H7343 the harlot H2181 (8802) alive H2421 (8689), and her father’s H0001 household H1004, and all that she had; and she dwelleth H3427 (8799) in H7130 Israel H3478 [even] unto this day H3117; because she hid H2244 (8689) the messengers H4397, which Joshua H3091 sent H7971 (8804) to spy out H7270 (8763) Jericho H3405.
006:026 And Joshua H3091 adjured H7650 (8686) [them] at that time H6256, saying H0559 (8800), Cursed H0779 (8803) [be] the man H0376 before H6440 the LORD H3068, that riseth up H6965 (8799) and buildeth H1129 (8804) this city H5892 Jericho H3405: he shall lay the foundation H3245 (8762) thereof in his firstborn H1060, and in his youngest H6810 [son] shall he set up H5324 (8686) the gates H1817 of it.
006:027 So the LORD H3068 was with Joshua H3091; and his fame H8089 was [noised] throughout all the country H0776.
007:001 ¶  But the children H1121 of Israel H3478 committed H4603 (8799) a trespass H4604 in the accursed thing H2764: for Achan H5912, the son H1121 of Carmi H3756, the son H1121 of Zabdi H2067, the son H1121 of Zerah H2226, of the tribe H4294 of Judah H3063, took H3947 (8799) of the accursed thing H2764: and the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8799) against the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
007:002 And Joshua H3091 sent H7971 (8799) men H0582 from Jericho H3405 to Ai H5857, which [is] beside H5973 Bethaven H1007, on the east side H6924 of Bethel H1008, and spake H0559 (8799) unto them, saying H0559 (8800), Go up H5927 (8798) and view H7270 (8761) the country H0776. And the men H0582 went up H5927 (8799) and viewed H7270 (8762) Ai H5857.
007:003 And they returned H7725 (8799) to Joshua H3091, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Let not all the people H5971 go up H5927 (8799); but let about two or three H7969 thousand H0505 men H0376 go up H5927 (8799) and smite H5221 (8686) Ai H5857; [and] make not all the people H5971 to labour H3021 (8762) thither; for they [are but] few H4592.
007:004 So there went up H5927 (8799) thither of the people H5971 about three H7969 thousand H0505 men H0376: and they fled H5127 (8799) before H6440 the men H0582 of Ai H5857.
007:005 And the men H0582 of Ai H5857 smote H5221 (8686) of them about thirty H7970 and six H8337 men H0376: for they chased H7291 (8799) them [from] before H6440 the gate H8179 [even] unto Shebarim H7671, and smote H5221 (8686) them in the going down H4174: wherefore the hearts H3824 of the people H5971 melted H4549 (8735), and became as water H4325.
007:006 And Joshua H3091 rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H8071, and fell H5307 (8799) to the earth H0776 upon his face H6440 before H6440 the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 until the eventide H6153, he and the elders H2205 of Israel H3478, and put H5927 (8686) dust H6083 upon their heads H7218.
007:007 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799), Alas, O H0162 Lord H0136 GOD H3069, wherefore hast thou at all H5674 (8687) brought H5674 this people H5971 over H5674 (8689) Jordan H3383, to deliver H5414 (8800) us into the hand H3027 of the Amorites H0567, to destroy H0006 (8687) us? would to God H3863 we had been content H2974 (8689), and dwelt H3427 (8799) on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383!
007:008 O H0994 Lord H0136, what shall I say H0559 (8799), when H0310 Israel H3478 turneth H2015 (8804) their backs H6203 before H6440 their enemies H0341 (8802)!
007:009 For the Canaanites H3669 and all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776 shall hear H8085 (8799) [of it], and shall environ us round H5437 (8738), and cut off H3772 (8689) our name H8034 from the earth H0776: and what wilt thou do H6213 (8799) unto thy great H1419 name H8034?
007:010 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, Get thee up H6965 (8798); wherefore liest H5307 (8802) thou thus upon thy face H6440?
007:011 Israel H3478 hath sinned H2398 (8804), and they have also transgressed H5674 (8804) my covenant H1285 which I commanded H6680 (8765) them: for they have even taken H3947 (8804) of the accursed thing H2764, and have also stolen H1589 (8804), and dissembled H3584 (8765) also, and they have put H7760 (8804) [it] even among their own stuff H3627.
007:012 Therefore the children H1121 of Israel H3478 could H3201 (8799) not stand H6965 (8800) before H6440 their enemies H0341 (8802), [but] turned H6437 (8799) [their] backs H6203 before H6440 their enemies H0341 (8802), because they were accursed H2764: neither will I be with you any more H3254 (8686), except H3808 ye destroy H8045 (8686) the accursed H2764 from among H7130 you.
007:013 Up H6965 (8798), sanctify H6942 (8761) the people H5971, and say H0559 (8804), Sanctify H6942 (8690) yourselves against to morrow H4279: for thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, [There is] an accursed thing H2764 in the midst H7130 of thee, O Israel H3478: thou canst H3201 (8799) not stand H6965 (8800) before H6440 thine enemies H0341 (8802), until ye take away H5493 (8687) the accursed thing H2764 from among H7130 you.
007:014 In the morning H1242 therefore ye shall be brought H7126 (8738) according to your tribes H7626: and it shall be, [that] the tribe H7626 which the LORD H3068 taketh H3920 (8799) shall come H7126 (8799) according to the families H4940 [thereof]; and the family H4940 which the LORD H3068 shall take H3920 (8799) shall come H7126 (8799) by households H1004; and the household H1004 which the LORD H3068 shall take H3920 (8799) shall come H7126 (8799) man H1397 by man H1397.
007:015 And it shall be, [that] he that is taken H3920 (8737) with the accursed thing H2764 shall be burnt H8313 (8735) with fire H0784, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed H5674 (8804) the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, and because he hath wrought H6213 (8804) folly H5039 in Israel H3478.
007:016 So Joshua H3091 rose up early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and brought H7126 (8686) Israel H3478 by their tribes H7626; and the tribe H7626 of Judah H3063 was taken H3920 (8735):
007:017 And he brought H7126 (8686) the family H4940 of Judah H3063; and he took H3920 (8799) the family H4940 of the Zarhites H2227: and he brought H7126 (8686) the family H4940 of the Zarhites H2227 man H1397 by man H1397; and Zabdi H2067 was taken H3920 (8735):
007:018 And he brought H7126 (8686) his household H1004 man H1397 by man H1397; and Achan H5912, the son H1121 of Carmi H3756, the son H1121 of Zabdi H2067, the son H1121 of Zerah H2226, of the tribe H4294 of Judah H3063, was taken H3920 (8735).
007:019 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto Achan H5912, My son H1121, give H7760 (8798), I pray thee, glory H3519 to the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, and make H5414 (8798) confession H8426 unto him; and tell H5046 (8685) me now what thou hast done H6213 (8804); hide H3582 (8762) [it] not from me.
007:020 And Achan H5912 answered H6030 (8799) Joshua H3091, and said H0559 (8799), Indeed H0546 I have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, and thus and thus have I done H6213 (8804):
007:021 When I saw H7200 (8799) among the spoils H7998 a H0259 goodly H2896 Babylonish H8152 garment H0155, and two hundred H3967 shekels H8255 of silver H3701, and a H0259 wedge H3956 of gold H2091 of fifty H2572 shekels H8255 weight H4948, then I coveted H2530 (8799) them, and took H3947 (8799) them; and, behold, they [are] hid H2934 (8803) in the earth H0776 in the midst H8432 of my tent H0168, and the silver H3701 under it.
007:022 So Joshua H3091 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397, and they ran H7323 (8799) unto the tent H0168; and, behold, [it was] hid H2934 (8803) in his tent H0168, and the silver H3701 under it.
007:023 And they took H3947 (8799) them out of the midst H8432 of the tent H0168, and brought H0935 (8686) them unto Joshua H3091, and unto all the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and laid them out H3332 (8686) before H6440 the LORD H3068.
007:024 And Joshua H3091, and all Israel H3478 with him, took H3947 (8799) Achan H5912 the son H1121 of Zerah H2226, and the silver H3701, and the garment H0155, and the wedge H3956 of gold H2091, and his sons H1121, and his daughters H1323, and his oxen H7794, and his asses H2543, and his sheep H6629, and his tent H0168, and all that he had: and they brought H5927 (8686) them unto the valley H6010 of Achor H5911.
007:025 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799), Why H4100 hast thou troubled H5916 (8804) us? the LORD H3068 shall trouble H5916 (8799) thee this day H3117. And all Israel H3478 stoned H7275 (8799) him with stones H0068, and burned H8313 (8799) them with fire H0784, after they had stoned H5619 (8799) them with stones H0068.
007:026 And they raised H6965 (8686) over him a great H1419 heap H1530 of stones H0068 unto this day H3117. So the LORD H3068 turned H7725 (8799) from the fierceness H2740 of his anger H0639. Wherefore the name H8034 of that place H4725 was called H7121 (8804), The valley H6010 of Achor H5911, unto this day H3117.
008:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, Fear H3372 (8799) not, neither be thou dismayed H2865 (8735): take H3947 (8798) all the people H5971 of war H4421 with thee, and arise H6965 (8798), go up H5927 (8798) to Ai H5857: see H7200 (8798), I have given H5414 (8804) into thy hand H3027 the king H4428 of Ai H5857, and his people H5971, and his city H5892, and his land H0776:
008:002 And thou shalt do H6213 (8804) to Ai H5857 and her king H4428 as thou didst H6213 (8804) unto Jericho H3405 and her king H4428: only the spoil H7998 thereof, and the cattle H0929 thereof, shall ye take for a prey H0962 (8799) unto yourselves: lay H7760 (8798) thee an ambush H0693 (8802) for the city H5892 behind H0310 it.
008:003 So Joshua H3091 arose H6965 (8799), and all the people H5971 of war H4421, to go up H5927 (8800) against Ai H5857: and Joshua H3091 chose out H0977 (8799) thirty H7970 thousand H0505 mighty H1368 men H0376 of valour H2428, and sent them away H7971 (8799) by night H3915.
008:004 And he commanded H6680 (8762) them, saying H0559 (8800), Behold H7200 (8798), ye shall lie in wait H0693 (8802) against the city H5892, [even] behind H0310 the city H5892: go H7368 not very H3966 far H7368 (8686) from the city H5892, but be ye all ready H3559 (8737):
008:005 And I, and all the people H5971 that [are] with me, will approach H7126 (8799) unto the city H5892: and it shall come to pass, when they come out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) us, as at the first H7223, that we will flee H5127 (8804) before H6440 them,
008:006 (For they will come out H3318 (8804) after H0310 us) till we have drawn H5423 (8687) them from the city H5892; for they will say H0559 (8799), They flee H5127 (8801) before H6440 us, as at the first H7223: therefore we will flee H5127 (8804) before H6440 them.
008:007 Then ye shall rise up H6965 (8799) from the ambush H0693 (8802), and seize H3423 (8689) upon the city H5892: for the LORD H3068 your God H0430 will deliver H5414 (8804) it into your hand H3027.
008:008 And it shall be, when ye have taken H8610 (8800) the city H5892, [that] ye shall set H3341 (8686) the city H5892 on fire H0784: according to the commandment H1697 of the LORD H3068 shall ye do H6213 (8799). See H7200 (8798), I have commanded H6680 (8765) you.
008:009 Joshua H3091 therefore sent them forth H7971 (8799): and they went H3212 (8799) to lie in ambush H3993, and abode H3427 (8799) between Bethel H1008 and Ai H5857, on the west side H3220 of Ai H5857: but Joshua H3091 lodged H3885 (8799) that night H3915 among H8432 the people H5971.
008:010 And Joshua H3091 rose up early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and numbered H6485 (8799) the people H5971, and went up H5927 (8799), he and the elders H2205 of Israel H3478, before H6440 the people H5971 to Ai H5857.
008:011 And all the people H5971, [even the people] of war H4421 that [were] with him, went up H5927 (8804), and drew nigh H5066 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) before the city H5892, and pitched H2583 (8799) on the north side H6828 of Ai H5857: now [there was] a valley H1516 between them and Ai H5857.
008:012 And he took H3947 (8799) about five H2568 thousand H0505 men H0376, and set H7760 (8799) them to lie in ambush H0693 (8802) between Bethel H1008 and Ai H5857, on the west side H3220 of the city H5857 (8675) H5892.
008:013 And when they had set H7760 (8799) the people H5971, [even] all the host H4264 that [was] on the north H6828 of the city H5892, and their liers in wait H6119 on the west H3220 of the city H5892, Joshua H3091 went H3212 (8799) that night H3915 into the midst H8432 of the valley H6010.
008:014 And it came to pass, when the king H4428 of Ai H5857 saw H7200 (8800) [it], that they hasted H4116 (8762) and rose up early H7925 (8686), and the men H0582 of the city H5892 went out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) Israel H3478 to battle H4421, he and all his people H5971, at a time appointed H4150, before H6440 the plain H6160; but he wist H3045 (8804) not that [there were] liers in ambush H0693 (8802) against him behind H0310 the city H5892.
008:015 And Joshua H3091 and all Israel H3478 made as if they were beaten H5060 (8735) before H6440 them, and fled H5127 (8799) by the way H1870 of the wilderness H4057.
008:016 And all the people H5971 that [were] in Ai H5857 (8675) H5892 were called H2199 (8735) together to pursue H7291 (8800) after H0310 them: and they pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 Joshua H3091, and were drawn away H5423 (8735) from the city H5892.
008:017 And there was not a man H0376 left H7604 (8738) in Ai H5857 or Bethel H1008, that went not out H3318 (8804) after H0310 Israel H3478: and they left H5800 (8799) the city H5892 open H6605 (8803), and pursued H7291 (8799) after Israel H3478.
008:018 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, Stretch out H5186 (8798) the spear H3591 that [is] in thy hand H3027 toward Ai H5857; for I will give H5414 (8799) it into thine hand H3027. And Joshua H3091 stretched out H5186 (8799) the spear H3591 that [he had] in his hand H3027 toward the city H5892.
008:019 And the ambush H0693 (8802) arose H6965 (8804) quickly H4120 out of their place H4725, and they ran H7323 (8799) as soon as he had stretched out H5186 (8800) his hand H3027: and they entered H0935 (8799) into the city H5892, and took H3920 (8799) it, and hasted H4116 (8762) and set H3341 (8686) the city H5892 on fire H0784.
008:020 And when the men H0582 of Ai H5857 looked H6437 (8799) behind H0310 them, they saw H7200 (8799), and, behold, the smoke H6227 of the city H5892 ascended up H5927 (8804) to heaven H8064, and they had no power H3027 to flee H5127 (8800) this way or that way H2008: and the people H5971 that fled H5127 (8801) to the wilderness H4057 turned back H2015 (8738) upon the pursuers H7291 (8802).
008:021 And when Joshua H3091 and all Israel H3478 saw H7200 (8804) that the ambush H0693 (8802) had taken H3920 (8804) the city H5892, and that the smoke H6227 of the city H5892 ascended H5927 (8804), then they turned again H7725 (8799), and slew H5221 (8686) the men H0582 of Ai H5857.
008:022 And the other H0428 issued out H3318 (8804) of the city H5892 against H7125 (8800) them; so they were in the midst H8432 of Israel H3478, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote H5221 (8686) them, so that H5704 they let H7604 (8689) none of them remain H8300 or escape H6412.
008:023 And the king H4428 of Ai H5857 they took H8610 (8804) alive H2416, and brought H7126 (8686) him to Joshua H3091.
008:024 And it came to pass, when Israel H3478 had made an end H3615 (8763) of slaying H2026 (8800) all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Ai H5857 in the field H7704, in the wilderness H4057 wherein they chased H7291 (8804) them, and when they were all fallen H5307 (8799) on the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, until they were consumed H8552 (8800), that all the Israelites H3478 returned H7725 (8799) unto Ai H5857, and smote H5221 (8686) it with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719.
008:025 And [so] it was, [that] all that fell H5307 (8802) that day H3117, both of men H0376 and women H0802, [were] twelve H8147 H6240 thousand H0505, [even] all the men H0582 of Ai H5857.
008:026 For Joshua H3091 drew H7725 not his hand H3027 back H7725 (8689), wherewith he stretched out H5186 (8804) the spear H3591, until he had utterly destroyed H2763 (8689) all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Ai H5857.
008:027 Only the cattle H0929 and the spoil H7998 of that city H5892 Israel H3478 took for a prey H0962 (8804) unto themselves, according unto the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 which he commanded H6680 (8765) Joshua H3091.
008:028 And Joshua H3091 burnt H8313 (8799) Ai H5857, and made H7760 (8799) it an heap H8510 for ever H5769, [even] a desolation H8077 unto this day H3117.
008:029 And the king H4428 of Ai H5857 he hanged H8518 (8804) on a tree H6086 until eventide H6256 H6153: and as soon as the sun H8121 was down H0935 (8800), Joshua H3091 commanded H6680 (8765) that they should take H3381 his carcase H5038 down H3381 (8686) from the tree H6086, and cast H7993 (8686) it at the entering H6607 of the gate H8179 of the city H5892, and raise H6965 (8686) thereon a great H1419 heap H1530 of stones H0068, [that remaineth] unto this day H3117.
008:030 Then Joshua H3091 built H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 in mount H2022 Ebal H5858,
008:031 As Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, as it is written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the law H8451 of Moses H4872, an altar H4196 of whole H8003 stones H0068, over which no man hath lift up H5130 (8689) [any] iron H1270: and they offered H5927 (8686) thereon burnt offerings H5930 unto the LORD H3068, and sacrificed H2076 (8799) peace offerings H8002.
008:032 And he wrote H3789 (8799) there upon the stones H0068 a copy H4932 of the law H8451 of Moses H4872, which he wrote H3789 (8804) in the presence H6440 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
008:033 And all Israel H3478, and their elders H2205, and officers H7860 (8802), and their judges H8199 (8802), stood H5975 (8802) on this side the ark H0727 and on that side before the priests H3548 the Levites H3881, which bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, as well the stranger H1616, as he that was born H0249 among them; half H2677 of them over H0413 against H4136 mount H2022 Gerizim H1630, and half H2677 of them over against H4136 mount H2022 Ebal H5858; as Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 had commanded H6680 (8765) before H7223, that they should bless H1288 (8763) the people H5971 of Israel H3478.
008:034 And afterward H0310 he read H7121 (8804) all the words H1697 of the law H8451, the blessings H1293 and cursings H7045, according to all that is written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the law H8451.
008:035 There was not a word H1697 of all that Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8765), which Joshua H3091 read H7121 (8804) not before all the congregation H6951 of Israel H3478, with the women H0802, and the little ones H2945, and the strangers H1616 that were conversant H1980 (8802) among H7130 them.
009:001 ¶  And it came to pass, when all the kings H4428 which [were] on this side H5676 Jordan H3383, in the hills H2022, and in the valleys H8219, and in all the coasts H2348 of the great H1419 sea H3220 over against H4136 Lebanon H3844, the Hittite H2850, and the Amorite H0567, the Canaanite H3669, the Perizzite H6522, the Hivite H2340, and the Jebusite H2983, heard H8085 (8800) [thereof];
009:002 That they gathered H6908 (8691) themselves together H3162, to fight H3898 (8736) with Joshua H3091 and with Israel H3478, with one H0259 accord H6310.
009:003 And when the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Gibeon H1391 heard H8085 (8804) what Joshua H3091 had done H6213 (8804) unto Jericho H3405 and to Ai H5857,
009:004 They did work H6213 (8799) wilily H6195, and went H3212 (8799) and made as if they had been ambassadors H6737 (8691), and took H3947 (8799) old H1087 sacks H8242 upon their asses H2543, and wine H3196 bottles H4997, old H1087, and rent H1234 (8794), and bound up H6887 (8794);
009:005 And old H1087 shoes H5275 and clouted H2921 (8794) upon their feet H7272, and old H1087 garments H8008 upon them; and all the bread H3899 of their provision H6718 was dry H3001 (8804) [and] mouldy H5350.
009:006 And they went H3212 (8799) to Joshua H3091 unto the camp H4264 at Gilgal H1537, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, and to the men H0376 of Israel H3478, We be come H0935 (8804) from a far H7350 country H0776: now therefore make H3772 (8798) ye a league H1285 with us.
009:007 And the men H0376 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto the Hivites H2340, Peradventure H0194 ye dwell H3427 (8802) among H7130 us; and how shall we make H3772 (8799) a league H1285 with you?
009:008 And they said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, We [are] thy servants H5650. And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Who [are] ye? and from whence H0370 come H0935 (8799) ye?
009:009 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, From a very H3966 far H7350 country H0776 thy servants H5650 are come H0935 (8804) because of the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: for we have heard H8085 (8804) the fame H8089 of him, and all that he did H6213 (8804) in Egypt H4714,
009:010 And all that he did H6213 (8804) to the two H8147 kings H4428 of the Amorites H0567, that [were] beyond H5676 Jordan H3383, to Sihon H5511 king H4428 of Heshbon H2809, and to Og H5747 king H4428 of Bashan H1316, which [was] at Ashtaroth H6252.
009:011 Wherefore our elders H2205 and all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of our country H0776 spake H0559 (8799) to us, saying H0559 (8800), Take H3947 (8798) victuals H6720 with you H3027 for the journey H1870, and go H3212 (8798) to meet H7125 (8800) them, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, We [are] your servants H5650: therefore now make H3772 (8798) ye a league H1285 with us.
009:012 This our bread H3899 we took hot H2525 [for] our provision H6679 (8694) out of our houses H1004 on the day H3117 we came forth H3318 (8800) to go H3212 (8800) unto you; but now, behold, it is dry H3001 (8804), and it is mouldy H5350:
009:013 And these bottles H4997 of wine H3196, which we filled H4390 (8765), [were] new H2319; and, behold, they be rent H1234 (8694): and these our garments H8008 and our shoes H5275 are become old H1086 (8804) by reason of the very H3966 long H7230 journey H1870.
009:014 And the men H0582 took H3947 (8799) of their victuals H6718, and asked H7592 (8804) not [counsel] at the mouth H6310 of the LORD H3068.
009:015 And Joshua H3091 made H6213 (8799) peace H7965 with them, and made H3772 (8799) a league H1285 with them, to let them live H2421 (8763): and the princes H5387 of the congregation H5712 sware H7650 (8735) unto them.
009:016 And it came to pass at the end H7097 of three H7969 days H3117 after H0310 they had made H3772 (8804) a league H1285 with them, that they heard H8085 (8799) that they [were] their neighbours H7138, and [that] they dwelt H3427 (8802) among H7130 them.
009:017 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 journeyed H5265 (8799), and came H0935 (8799) unto their cities H5892 on the third H7992 day H3117. Now their cities H5892 [were] Gibeon H1391, and Chephirah H3716, and Beeroth H0881, and Kirjathjearim H7157.
009:018 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 smote H5221 (8689) them not, because the princes H5387 of the congregation H5712 had sworn H7650 (8738) unto them by the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478. And all the congregation H5712 murmured H3885 (8735) against the princes H5387.
009:019 But all the princes H5387 said H0559 (8799) unto all the congregation H5712, We have sworn H7650 (8738) unto them by the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478: now therefore we may H3201 (8799) not touch H5060 (8800) them.
009:020 This we will do H6213 (8799) to them; we will even let them live H2421 (8687), lest wrath H7110 be upon us, because of the oath H7621 which we sware H7650 (8738) unto them.
009:021 And the princes H5387 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Let them live H2421 (8799); but let them be hewers H2404 (8802) of wood H6086 and drawers H7579 (8802) of water H4325 unto all the congregation H5712; as the princes H5387 had promised H1696 (8765) them.
009:022 And Joshua H3091 called H7121 (8799) for them, and he spake H1696 (8762) unto them, saying H0559 (8800), Wherefore have ye beguiled H7411 (8765) us, saying H0559 (8800), We [are] very H3966 far H7350 from you; when ye dwell H3427 (8802) among H7130 us?
009:023 Now therefore ye [are] cursed H0779 (8803), and there shall none of you be freed H3772 (8735) from being bondmen H5650, and hewers H2404 (8802) of wood H6086 and drawers H7579 (8802) of water H4325 for the house H1004 of my God H0430.
009:024 And they answered H6030 (8799) Joshua H3091, and said H0559 (8799), Because it was certainly H5046 (8715) told H5046 (8717) thy servants H5650, how that the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 commanded H6680 (8765) his servant H5650 Moses H4872 to give H5414 (8800) you all the land H0776, and to destroy H8045 (8687) all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776 from before H6440 you, therefore we were sore H3966 afraid H3372 (8799) of our lives H5315 because H6440 of you, and have done H6213 (8799) this thing H1697.
009:025 And now, behold, we H2009 [are] in thine hand H3027: as it seemeth H5869 good H2896 and right H3477 unto thee to do H6213 (8800) unto us, do H6213 (8798).
009:026 And so did H6213 (8799) he unto them, and delivered H5337 (8686) them out of the hand H3027 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that they slew H2026 (8804) them not.
009:027 And Joshua H3091 made H5414 (8799) them that day H3117 hewers H2404 (8802) of wood H6086 and drawers H7579 (8802) of water H4325 for the congregation H5712, and for the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068, even unto this day H3117, in the place H4725 which he should choose H0977 (8799).
010:001 ¶  Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek H0139 king H4428 of Jerusalem H3389 had heard H8085 (8800) how H3588 Joshua H3091 had taken H3920 (8804) Ai H5857, and had utterly destroyed H2763 (8686) it; as he had done H6213 (8804) to Jericho H3405 and her king H4428, so he had done H6213 (8804) to Ai H5857 and her king H4428; and how the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Gibeon H1391 had made peace H7999 (8689) with Israel H3478, and were among H7130 them;
010:002 That they feared H3372 (8799) greatly H3966, because Gibeon H1391 [was] a great H1419 city H5892, as one H0259 of the royal H4467 cities H5892, and because it [was] greater H1419 than Ai H5857, and all the men H0582 thereof [were] mighty H1368.
010:003 Wherefore Adonizedek H0139 king H4428 of Jerusalem H3389 sent H7971 (8799) unto Hoham H1944 king H4428 of Hebron H2275, and unto Piram H6502 king H4428 of Jarmuth H3412, and unto Japhia H3309 king H4428 of Lachish H3923, and unto Debir H1688 king H4428 of Eglon H5700, saying H0559 (8800),
010:004 Come up H5927 (8798) unto me, and help H5826 (8798) me, that we may smite H5221 (8686) Gibeon H1391: for it hath made peace H7999 (8689) with Joshua H3091 and with the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
010:005 Therefore the five H2568 kings H4428 of the Amorites H0567, the king H4428 of Jerusalem H3389, the king H4428 of Hebron H2275, the king H4428 of Jarmuth H3412, the king H4428 of Lachish H3923, the king H4428 of Eglon H5700, gathered themselves together H0622 (8735), and went up H5927 (8799), they and all their hosts H4264, and encamped H2583 (8799) before Gibeon H1391, and made war H3898 (8735) against it.
010:006 And the men H0582 of Gibeon H1391 sent H7971 (8799) unto Joshua H3091 to the camp H4264 to Gilgal H1537, saying H0559 (8800), Slack H7503 (8686) not thy hand H3027 from thy servants H5650; come up H5927 (8798) to us quickly H4120, and save H3467 (8685) us, and help H5826 (8798) us: for all the kings H4428 of the Amorites H0567 that dwell H3427 (8802) in the mountains H2022 are gathered together H6908 (8738) against us.
010:007 So Joshua H3091 ascended H5927 (8799) from Gilgal H1537, he, and all the people H5971 of war H4421 with him, and all the mighty H1368 men of valour H2428.
010:008 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, Fear H3372 (8799) them not: for I have delivered H5414 (8804) them into thine hand H3027; there shall not a man H0376 of them stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 thee.
010:009 Joshua H3091 therefore came H0935 (8799) unto them suddenly H6597, [and] went up H5927 (8804) from Gilgal H1537 all night H3915.
010:010 And the LORD H3068 discomfited H2000 (8799) them before H6440 Israel H3478, and slew H5221 (8686) them with a great H1419 slaughter H4347 at Gibeon H1391, and chased H7291 (8799) them along the way H1870 that goeth up H4608 to Bethhoron H1032, and smote H5221 (8686) them to Azekah H5825, and unto Makkedah H4719.
010:011 And it came to pass, as they fled H5127 (8800) from before H6440 Israel H3478, [and] were in the going down H4174 to Bethhoron H1032, that the LORD H3068 cast down H7993 (8689) great H1419 stones H0068 from heaven H8064 upon them unto Azekah H5825, and they died H4191 (8799): [they were] more H7227 which died H4191 (8804) with hailstones H1259 H0068 than [they] whom H0834 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 slew H2026 (8804) with the sword H2719.
010:012 Then spake H1696 (8762) Joshua H3091 to the LORD H3068 in the day H3117 when the LORD H3068 delivered up H5414 (8800) the Amorites H0567 before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and he said H0559 (8799) in the sight H5869 of Israel H3478, Sun H8121, stand thou still H1826 (8798) upon Gibeon H1391; and thou, Moon H3394, in the valley H6010 of Ajalon H0357.
010:013 And the sun H8121 stood still H1826 (8799), and the moon H3394 stayed H5975 (8804), until the people H1471 had avenged H5358 (8799) themselves upon their enemies H0341 (8802). [Is] not this H1931 written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of Jasher H3477? So the sun H8121 stood still H5975 (8799) in the midst H2677 of heaven H8064, and hasted H0213 (8804) not to go down H0935 (8800) about a whole H8549 day H3117.
010:014 And there was no day H3117 like that before H6440 it or after H0310 it, that the LORD H3068 hearkened H8085 (8800) unto the voice H6963 of a man H0376: for the LORD H3068 fought H3898 (8737) for Israel H3478.
010:015 And Joshua H3091 returned H7725 (8799), and all Israel H3478 with him, unto the camp H4264 to Gilgal H1537.
010:016 But these five H2568 kings H4428 fled H5127 (8799), and hid H2244 (8735) themselves in a cave H4631 at Makkedah H4719.
010:017 And it was told H5046 (8714) Joshua H3091, saying H0559 (8800), The five H2568 kings H4428 are found H4672 (8738) hid H2244 (8737) in a cave H4631 at Makkedah H4719.
010:018 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799), Roll H1556 (8798) great H1419 stones H0068 upon the mouth H6310 of the cave H4631, and set H6485 (8685) men H0582 by it for to keep H8104 (8800) them:
010:019 And stay H5975 (8799) ye not, [but] pursue H7291 (8798) after H0310 your enemies H0341 (8802), and smite the hindmost H2179 (8765) of them; suffer H5414 (8799) them not to enter H0935 (8800) into their cities H5892: for the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath delivered H5414 (8804) them into your hand H3027.
010:020 And it came to pass, when Joshua H3091 and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 had made an end H3615 (8763) of slaying H5221 (8687) them with a very H3966 great H1419 slaughter H4347, till they were consumed H8552 (8800), that the rest H8300 [which] remained H8277 (8804) of them entered H0935 (8799) into fenced H4013 cities H5892.
010:021 And all the people H5971 returned H7725 (8799) to the camp H4264 to Joshua H3091 at Makkedah H4719 in peace H7965: none moved H2782 (8804) his tongue H3956 against any H0376 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
010:022 Then said H0559 (8799) Joshua H3091, Open H6605 (8798) the mouth H6310 of the cave H4631, and bring out H3318 (8685) those five H2568 kings H4428 unto me out of the cave H4631.
010:023 And they did H6213 (8799) so, and brought forth H3318 (8686) those five H2568 kings H4428 unto him out of the cave H4631, the king H4428 of Jerusalem H3389, the king H4428 of Hebron H2275, the king H4428 of Jarmuth H3412, the king H4428 of Lachish H3923, [and] the king H4428 of Eglon H5700.
010:024 And it came to pass, when they brought out H3318 (8687) those kings H4428 unto Joshua H3091, that Joshua H3091 called H7121 (8799) for all the men H0376 of Israel H3478, and said H0559 (8799) unto the captains H7101 of the men H0582 of war H4421 which went H1980 (8804) with him, Come near H7126 (8798), put H7760 (8798) your feet H7272 upon the necks H6677 of these kings H4428. And they came near H7126 (8799), and put H7760 (8799) their feet H7272 upon the necks H6677 of them.
010:025 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Fear H3372 (8799) not, nor be dismayed H2865 (8735), be strong H2388 (8798) and of good courage H0553 (8798): for thus shall the LORD H3068 do H6213 (8799) to all your enemies H0341 (8802) against whom ye fight H3898 (8737).
010:026 And afterward H0310 Joshua H3091 smote H5221 (8686) them, and slew H4191 (8686) them, and hanged H8518 (8799) them on five H2568 trees H6086: and they were hanging H8518 (8803) upon the trees H6086 until the evening H6153.
010:027 And it came to pass at the time H6256 of the going down H0935 (8800) of the sun H8121, [that] Joshua H3091 commanded H6680 (8765), and they took them down H3381 (8686) off the trees H6086, and cast H7993 (8686) them into the cave H4631 wherein they had been hid H2244 (8738), and laid H7760 (8799) great H1419 stones H0068 in the cave’s H4631 mouth H6310, [which remain] until this very H6106 day H3117.
010:028 And that day H3117 Joshua H3091 took H3920 (8804) Makkedah H4719, and smote H5221 (8686) it with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and the king H4428 thereof he utterly destroyed H2763 (8689), them, and all the souls H5315 that [were] therein; he let H7604 (8689) none remain H8300: and he did H6213 (8799) to the king H4428 of Makkedah H4719 as he did H6213 (8804) unto the king H4428 of Jericho H3405.
010:029 Then Joshua H3091 passed H5674 (8799) from Makkedah H4719, and all Israel H3478 with him, unto Libnah H3841, and fought H3898 (8735) against Libnah H3841:
010:030 And the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) it also, and the king H4428 thereof, into the hand H3027 of Israel H3478; and he smote H5221 (8686) it with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and all the souls H5315 that [were] therein; he let H7604 (8689) none remain H8300 in it; but did H6213 (8799) unto the king H4428 thereof as he did H6213 (8804) unto the king H4428 of Jericho H3405.
010:031 And Joshua H3091 passed H5674 (8799) from Libnah H3841, and all Israel H3478 with him, unto Lachish H3923, and encamped H2583 (8799) against it, and fought H3898 (8735) against it:
010:032 And the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) Lachish H3923 into the hand H3027 of Israel H3478, which took H3920 (8799) it on the second H8145 day H3117, and smote H5221 (8686) it with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and all the souls H5315 that [were] therein, according to all that he had done H6213 (8804) to Libnah H3841.
010:033 Then Horam H2036 king H4428 of Gezer H1507 came up H5927 (8804) to help H5826 (8800) Lachish H3923; and Joshua H3091 smote H5221 (8686) him and his people H5971, until he had left H7604 (8689) him none remaining H8300.
010:034 And from Lachish H3923 Joshua H3091 passed H5674 (8799) unto Eglon H5700, and all Israel H3478 with him; and they encamped H2583 (8799) against it, and fought H3898 (8735) against it:
010:035 And they took H3920 (8799) it on that day H3117, and smote H5221 (8686) it with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and all the souls H5315 that [were] therein he utterly destroyed H2763 (8689) that day H3117, according to all that he had done H6213 (8804) to Lachish H3923.
010:036 And Joshua H3091 went up H5927 (8799) from Eglon H5700, and all Israel H3478 with him, unto Hebron H2275; and they fought H3898 (8735) against it:
010:037 And they took H3920 (8799) it, and smote H5221 (8686) it with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and the king H4428 thereof, and all the cities H5892 thereof, and all the souls H5315 that [were] therein; he left H7604 (8689) none remaining H8300, according to all that he had done H6213 (8804) to Eglon H5700; but destroyed H2763 (8686) it utterly, and all the souls H5315 that [were] therein.
010:038 And Joshua H3091 returned H7725 (8799), and all Israel H3478 with him, to Debir H1688; and fought H3898 (8735) against it:
010:039 And he took H3920 (8799) it, and the king H4428 thereof, and all the cities H5892 thereof; and they smote H5221 (8686) them with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and utterly destroyed H2763 (8686) all the souls H5315 that [were] therein; he left H7604 (8689) none remaining H8300: as he had done H6213 (8804) to Hebron H2275, so he did H6213 (8804) to Debir H1688, and to the king H4428 thereof; as he had done H6213 (8804) also to Libnah H3841, and to her king H4428.
010:040 So Joshua H3091 smote H5221 (8686) all the country H0776 of the hills H2022, and of the south H5045, and of the vale H8219, and of the springs H0794, and all their kings H4428: he left H7604 (8689) none remaining H8300, but utterly destroyed H2763 (8689) all that breathed H5397, as the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 commanded H6680 (8765).
010:041 And Joshua H3091 smote H5221 (8686) them from Kadeshbarnea H6947 even unto Gaza H5804, and all the country H0776 of Goshen H1657, even unto Gibeon H1391.
010:042 And all these kings H4428 and their land H0776 did Joshua H3091 take H3920 (8804) at one H0259 time H6471, because the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 fought H3898 (8737) for Israel H3478.
010:043 And Joshua H3091 returned H7725 (8799), and all Israel H3478 with him, unto the camp H4264 to Gilgal H1537.
011:001 ¶  And it came to pass, when Jabin H2985 king H4428 of Hazor H2674 had heard H8085 (8800) [those things], that he sent H7971 (8799) to Jobab H3103 king H4428 of Madon H4068, and to the king H4428 of Shimron H8110, and to the king H4428 of Achshaph H0407,
011:002 And to the kings H4428 that [were] on the north H6828 of the mountains H2022, and of the plains H6160 south H5045 of Chinneroth H3672, and in the valley H8219, and in the borders H5299 of Dor H1756 on the west H3220,
011:003 [And to] the Canaanite H3669 on the east H4217 and on the west H3220, and [to] the Amorite H0567, and the Hittite H2850, and the Perizzite H6522, and the Jebusite H2983 in the mountains H2022, and [to] the Hivite H2340 under Hermon H2768 in the land H0776 of Mizpeh H4709.
011:004 And they went out H3318 (8799), they and all their hosts H4264 with them, much H7227 people H5971, even as the sand H2344 that [is] upon the sea H3220 shore H8193 in multitude H7230, with horses H5483 and chariots H7393 very H3966 many H7227.
011:005 And when all these kings H4428 were met together H3259 (8735), they came H0935 (8799) and pitched H2583 (8799) together H3162 at the waters H4325 of Merom H4792, to fight H3898 (8736) against Israel H3478.
011:006 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, Be not afraid H3372 (8799) because H6440 of them: for to morrow H4279 about this time H6256 will I deliver them up H5414 (8802) all slain H2491 before H6440 Israel H3478: thou shalt hough H6131 (8762) their horses H5483, and burn H8313 (8799) their chariots H4818 with fire H0784.
011:007 So Joshua H3091 came H0935 (8799), and all the people H5971 of war H4421 with him, against them by the waters H4325 of Merom H4792 suddenly H6597; and they fell upon H5307 (8799) them.
011:008 And the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of Israel H3478, who smote H5221 (8686) them, and chased H7291 (8799) them unto great H7227 Zidon H6721, and unto Misrephothmaim H4956, and unto the valley H1237 of Mizpeh H4708 eastward H4217; and they smote H5221 (8686) them, until they left H7604 (8689) them none remaining H8300.
011:009 And Joshua H3091 did H6213 (8799) unto them as the LORD H3068 bade H0559 (8804) him: he houghed H6131 (8765) their horses H5483, and burnt H8313 (8804) their chariots H4818 with fire H0784.
011:010 And Joshua H3091 at that time H6256 turned back H7725 (8799), and took H3920 (8799) Hazor H2674, and smote H5221 (8689) the king H4428 thereof with the sword H2719: for Hazor H2674 beforetime H6440 was the head H7218 of all those kingdoms H4467.
011:011 And they smote H5221 (8686) all the souls H5315 that [were] therein with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, utterly destroying H2763 (8687) [them]: there was not any left H3498 (8738) to breathe H5397: and he burnt H8313 (8804) Hazor H2674 with fire H0784.
011:012 And all the cities H5892 of those kings H4428, and all the kings H4428 of them, did Joshua H3091 take H3920 (8804), and smote H5221 (8686) them with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, [and] he utterly destroyed H2763 (8689) them, as Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765).
011:013 But [as for] the cities H5892 that stood H5975 (8802) still in their strength H8510, Israel H3478 burned H8313 (8804) none of them, save H2108 Hazor H2674 only; [that] did Joshua H3091 burn H8313 (8804).
011:014 And all the spoil H7998 of these cities H5892, and the cattle H0929, the children H1121 of Israel H3478 took for a prey H0962 (8804) unto themselves; but every man H0120 they smote H5221 (8689) with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, until they had destroyed H8045 (8687) them, neither left H7604 (8689) they any to breathe H5397.
011:015 As the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872 his servant H5650, so did Moses H4872 command H6680 (8765) Joshua H3091, and so did H6213 (8804) Joshua H3091; he left H5493 nothing H1697 undone H5493 (8689) of all that the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
011:016 So Joshua H3091 took H3947 (8799) all that land H0776, the hills H2022, and all the south country H5045, and all the land H0776 of Goshen H1657, and the valley H8219, and the plain H6160, and the mountain H2022 of Israel H3478, and the valley H8219 of the same;
011:017 [Even] from the mount H2022 Halak H2510, that goeth up H5927 (8802) to Seir H8165, even unto Baalgad H1171 in the valley H1237 of Lebanon H3844 under mount H2022 Hermon H2768: and all their kings H4428 he took H3920 (8804), and smote H5221 (8686) them, and slew H4191 (8686) them.
011:018 Joshua H3091 made H6213 (8804) war H4421 a long H7227 time H3117 with all those kings H4428.
011:019 There was not a city H5892 that made peace H7999 (8689) with the children H1121 of Israel H3478, save the Hivites H2340 the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Gibeon H1391: all [other] they took H3947 (8804) in battle H4421.
011:020 For it was of the LORD H3068 to harden H2388 (8763) their hearts H3820, that they should come against H7125 (8800) Israel H3478 in battle H4421, that he might destroy them utterly H2763 (8687), [and] that they might have no favour H8467, but that he might destroy H8045 (8687) them, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
011:021 And at that time H6256 came H0935 (8799) Joshua H3091, and cut off H3772 (8686) the Anakims H6062 from the mountains H2022, from Hebron H2275, from Debir H1688, from Anab H6024, and from all the mountains H2022 of Judah H3063, and from all the mountains H2022 of Israel H3478: Joshua H3091 destroyed them utterly H2763 (8689) with their cities H5892.
011:022 There was none of the Anakims H6062 left H3498 (8738) in the land H0776 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478: only in Gaza H5804, in Gath H1661, and in Ashdod H0795, there remained H7604 (8738).
011:023 So Joshua H3091 took H3947 (8799) the whole land H0776, according to all that the LORD H3068 said H1696 (8765) unto Moses H4872; and Joshua H3091 gave H5414 (8799) it for an inheritance H5159 unto Israel H3478 according to their divisions H4256 by their tribes H7626. And the land H0776 rested H8252 (8804) from war H4421.
012:001 ¶  Now these [are] the kings H4428 of the land H0776, which the children H1121 of Israel H3478 smote H5221 (8689), and possessed H3423 (8799) their land H0776 on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383 toward the rising H4217 of the sun H8121, from the river H5158 Arnon H0769 unto mount H2022 Hermon H2768, and all the plain H6160 on the east H4217:
012:002 Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, who dwelt H3427 (8802) in Heshbon H2809, [and] ruled H4910 (8802) from Aroer H6177, which [is] upon the bank H8193 of the river H5158 Arnon H0769, and from the middle H8432 of the river H5158, and from half H2677 Gilead H1568, even unto the river H5158 Jabbok H2999, [which is] the border H1366 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983;
012:003 And from the plain H6160 to the sea H3220 of Chinneroth H3672 on the east H4217, and unto the sea H3220 of the plain H6160, [even] the salt H4417 sea H3220 on the east H4217, the way H1870 to Bethjeshimoth H1020; and from the south H8486, under Ashdothpisgah H0798 (8676) H0794:
012:004 And the coast H1366 of Og H5747 king H4428 of Bashan H1316, [which was] of the remnant H3499 of the giants H7497, that dwelt H3427 (8802) at Ashtaroth H6252 and at Edrei H0154,
012:005 And reigned H4910 (8802) in mount H2022 Hermon H2768, and in Salcah H5548, and in all Bashan H1316, unto the border H1366 of the Geshurites H1651 and the Maachathites H4602, and half H2677 Gilead H1568, the border H1366 of Sihon H5511 king H4428 of Heshbon H2809.
012:006 Them did Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 smite H5221 (8689): and Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8799) it [for] a possession H3425 unto the Reubenites H7206, and the Gadites H1425, and the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519.
012:007 And these [are] the kings H4428 of the country H0776 which Joshua H3091 and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 smote H5221 (8689) on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 on the west H3220, from Baalgad H1171 in the valley H1237 of Lebanon H3844 even unto the mount H2022 Halak H2510, that goeth up H5927 (8802) to Seir H8165; which Joshua H3091 gave H5414 (8799) unto the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 [for] a possession H3425 according to their divisions H4256;
012:008 In the mountains H2022, and in the valleys H8219, and in the plains H6160, and in the springs H0794, and in the wilderness H4057, and in the south country H5045; the Hittites H2850, the Amorites H0567, and the Canaanites H3669, the Perizzites H6522, the Hivites H2340, and the Jebusites H2983:
012:009 The king H4428 of Jericho H3405, one H0259; the king H4428 of Ai H5857, which [is] beside H6654 Bethel H1008, one H0259;
012:010 The king H4428 of Jerusalem H3389, one H0259; the king H4428 of Hebron H2275, one H0259;
012:011 The king H4428 of Jarmuth H3412, one H0259; the king H4428 of Lachish H3923, one H0259;
012:012 The king H4428 of Eglon H5700, one H0259; the king H4428 of Gezer H1507, one H0259;
012:013 The king H4428 of Debir H1688, one H0259; the king H4428 of Geder H1445, one H0259;
012:014 The king H4428 of Hormah H2767, one H0259; the king H4428 of Arad H6166, one H0259;
012:015 The king H4428 of Libnah H3841, one H0259; the king H4428 of Adullam H5725, one H0259;
012:016 The king H4428 of Makkedah H4719, one H0259; the king H4428 of Bethel H1008, one H0259;
012:017 The king H4428 of Tappuah H8599, one H0259; the king H4428 of Hepher H2660, one H0259;
012:018 The king H4428 of Aphek H0663, one H0259; the king H4428 of Lasharon H8289, one H0259;
012:019 The king H4428 of Madon H4068, one H0259; the king H4428 of Hazor H2674, one H0259;
012:020 The king H4428 of Shimronmeron H8112, one H0259; the king H4428 of Achshaph H0407, one H0259;
012:021 The king H4428 of Taanach H8590, one H0259; the king H4428 of Megiddo H4023, one H0259;
012:022 The king H4428 of Kedesh H6943, one H0259; the king H4428 of Jokneam H3362 of Carmel H3760, one H0259;
012:023 The king H4428 of Dor H1756 in the coast H5299 of Dor H1756, one H0259; the king H4428 of the nations H1471 of Gilgal H1537, one H0259;
012:024 The king H4428 of Tirzah H8656, one H0259: all the kings H4428 thirty H7970 and one H0259.
013:001 ¶  Now Joshua H3091 was old H2204 (8804) [and] stricken H0935 (8804) in years H3117; and the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thou art old H2204 (8804) [and] stricken H0935 (8804) in years H3117, and there remaineth H7604 (8738) yet very H3966 much H7235 (8687) land H0776 to be possessed H3423 (8800).
013:002 This [is] the land H0776 that yet remaineth H7604 (8737): all the borders H1552 of the Philistines H6430, and all Geshuri H1651,
013:003 From Sihor H7883, which [is] before H6440 Egypt H4714, even unto the borders H1366 of Ekron H6138 northward H6828, [which] is counted H2803 (8735) to the Canaanite H3669: five H2568 lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430; the Gazathites H5841, and the Ashdothites H0796, the Eshkalonites H0832, the Gittites H1663, and the Ekronites H6139; also the Avites H5761:
013:004 From the south H8486, all the land H0776 of the Canaanites H3669, and Mearah H4632 that [is] beside the Sidonians H6722, unto Aphek H0663, to the borders H1366 of the Amorites H0567:
013:005 And the land H0776 of the Giblites H1382, and all Lebanon H3844, toward the sunrising H4217 H8121, from Baalgad H1171 under mount H2022 Hermon H2768 unto the entering H0935 (8800) into Hamath H2574.
013:006 All the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the hill country H2022 from Lebanon H3844 unto Misrephothmaim H4956, [and] all the Sidonians H6722, them will I drive out H3423 (8686) from before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478: only divide thou it by lot H5307 (8685) unto the Israelites H3478 for an inheritance H5159, as I have commanded H6680 (8765) thee.
013:007 Now therefore divide H2505 (8761) this land H0776 for an inheritance H5159 unto the nine H8672 tribes H7626, and the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519,
013:008 With whom the Reubenites H7206 and the Gadites H1425 have received H3947 (8804) their inheritance H5159, which Moses H4872 gave H5414 (8804) them, beyond H5676 Jordan H3383 eastward H4217, [even] as Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8804) them;
013:009 From Aroer H6177, that [is] upon the bank H8193 of the river H5158 Arnon H0769, and the city H5892 that [is] in the midst H8432 of the river H5158, and all the plain H4334 of Medeba H4311 unto Dibon H1769;
013:010 And all the cities H5892 of Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, which reigned H4427 (8804) in Heshbon H2809, unto the border H1366 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983;
013:011 And Gilead H1568, and the border H1366 of the Geshurites H1651 and Maachathites H4602, and all mount H2022 Hermon H2768, and all Bashan H1316 unto Salcah H5548;
013:012 All the kingdom H4468 of Og H5747 in Bashan H1316, which reigned H4427 (8804) in Ashtaroth H6252 and in Edrei H0154, who remained H7604 (8738) of the remnant H3499 of the giants H7497: for these did Moses H4872 smite H5221 (8686), and cast them out H3423 (8686).
013:013 Nevertheless the children H1121 of Israel H3478 expelled H3423 (8689) not the Geshurites H1651, nor the Maachathites H4602: but the Geshurites H1650 and the Maachathites H4601 dwell H3427 (8799) among H7130 the Israelites H3478 until this day H3117.
013:014 Only unto the tribe H7626 of Levi H3878 he gave H5414 (8804) none inheritance H5159; the sacrifices H0801 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 made by fire H0801 [are] their inheritance H5159, as he said H1696 (8765) unto them.
013:015 And Moses H4872 gave H5414 (8799) unto the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 [inheritance] according to their families H4940.
013:016 And their coast H1366 was from Aroer H6177, that [is] on the bank H8193 of the river H5158 Arnon H0769, and the city H5892 that [is] in the midst H8432 of the river H5158, and all the plain H4334 by Medeba H4311;
013:017 Heshbon H2809, and all her cities H5892 that [are] in the plain H4334; Dibon H1769, and Bamothbaal H1120, and Bethbaalmeon H1010,
013:018 And Jahazah H3096, and Kedemoth H6932, and Mephaath H4158,
013:019 And Kirjathaim H7156, and Sibmah H7643, and Zarethshahar H6890 in the mount H2022 of the valley H6010,
013:020 And Bethpeor H1047, and Ashdothpisgah H0798 (8676) H0794, and Bethjeshimoth H1020,
013:021 And all the cities H5892 of the plain H4334, and all the kingdom H4468 of Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, which reigned H4427 (8804) in Heshbon H2809, whom Moses H4872 smote H5221 (8689) with the princes H5387 of Midian H4080, Evi H0189, and Rekem H7552, and Zur H6698, and Hur H2354, and Reba H7254, [which were] dukes H5257 of Sihon H5511, dwelling H3427 (8802) in the country H0776.
013:022 Balaam H1109 also the son H1121 of Beor H1160, the soothsayer H7080 (8802), did the children H1121 of Israel H3478 slay H2026 (8804) with the sword H2719 among them H0413 that were slain H2491 by them.
013:023 And the border H1366 of the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 was Jordan H3383, and the border H1366 [thereof]. This [was] the inheritance H5159 of the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 after their families H4940, the cities H5892 and the villages H2691 thereof.
013:024 And Moses H4872 gave H5414 (8799) [inheritance] unto the tribe H4294 of Gad H1410, [even] unto the children H1121 of Gad H1410 according to their families H4940.
013:025 And their coast H1366 was Jazer H3270, and all the cities H5892 of Gilead H1568, and half H2677 the land H0776 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, unto Aroer H6177 that [is] before H6440 Rabbah H7237;
013:026 And from Heshbon H2809 unto Ramathmizpeh H7434, and Betonim H0993; and from Mahanaim H4266 unto the border H1366 of Debir H1688;
013:027 And in the valley H6010, Betharam H1027, and Bethnimrah H1039, and Succoth H5523, and Zaphon H6829, the rest H3499 of the kingdom H4468 of Sihon H5511 king H4428 of Heshbon H2809, Jordan H3383 and [his] border H1366, [even] unto the edge H7097 of the sea H3220 of Chinnereth H3672 on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383 eastward H4217.
013:028 This [is] the inheritance H5159 of the children H1121 of Gad H1410 after their families H4940, the cities H5892, and their villages H2691.
013:029 And Moses H4872 gave H5414 (8799) [inheritance] unto the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519: and [this] was [the possession] of the half H2677 tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Manasseh H4519 by their families H4940.
013:030 And their coast H1366 was from Mahanaim H4266, all Bashan H1316, all the kingdom H4468 of Og H5747 king H4428 of Bashan H1316, and all the towns H2333 of Jair H2971, which [are] in Bashan H1316, threescore H8346 cities H5892:
013:031 And half H2677 Gilead H1568, and Ashtaroth H6252, and Edrei H0154, cities H5892 of the kingdom H4468 of Og H5747 in Bashan H1316, [were pertaining] unto the children H1121 of Machir H4353 the son H1121 of Manasseh H4519, [even] to the one half H2677 of the children H1121 of Machir H4353 by their families H4940.
013:032 These [are the countries] which Moses H4872 did distribute for inheritance H5157 (8765) in the plains H6160 of Moab H4124, on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383, by Jericho H3405, eastward H4217.
013:033 But unto the tribe H7626 of Levi H3878 Moses H4872 gave H5414 (8804) not [any] inheritance H5159: the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 [was] their inheritance H5159, as he said H1696 (8765) unto them.
014:001 ¶  And these [are the countries] which the children H1121 of Israel H3478 inherited H5157 (8804) in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, which Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, and the heads H7218 of the fathers H0001 of the tribes H4294 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, distributed for inheritance H5157 (8765) to them.
014:002 By lot H1486 [was] their inheritance H5159, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872, for the nine H8672 tribes H4294, and [for] the half H2677 tribe H4294.
014:003 For Moses H4872 had given H5414 (8804) the inheritance H5159 of two H8147 tribes H4294 and an half H2677 tribe H4294 on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383: but unto the Levites H3881 he gave H5414 (8804) none inheritance H5159 among H8432 them.
014:004 For the children H1121 of Joseph H3130 were two H8147 tribes H4294, Manasseh H4519 and Ephraim H0669: therefore they gave H5414 (8804) no part H2506 unto the Levites H3881 in the land H0776, save cities H5892 to dwell H3427 (8800) [in], with their suburbs H4054 for their cattle H4735 and for their substance H7075.
014:005 As the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872, so the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did H6213 (8804), and they divided H2505 (8799) the land H0776.
014:006 Then the children H1121 of Judah H3063 came H5066 (8799) unto Joshua H3091 in Gilgal H1537: and Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312 the Kenezite H7074 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thou knowest H3045 (8804) the thing H1697 that the LORD H3068 said H1696 (8765) unto Moses H4872 the man H0376 of God H0430 concerning me H0182 and thee H0182 in Kadeshbarnea H6947.
014:007 Forty H0705 years H8141 old H1121 [was] I when Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8800) me from Kadeshbarnea H6947 to espy out H7270 (8763) the land H0776; and I brought H7725 him word H1697 again H7725 (8686) as [it was] in mine heart H3824.
014:008 Nevertheless my brethren H0251 that went up H5927 (8804) with me made the heart H3820 of the people H5971 melt H4529 (8689): but I wholly H4390 (8765) followed H0310 the LORD H3068 my God H0430.
014:009 And Moses H4872 sware H7650 (8735) on that day H3117, saying H0559 (8800), Surely the land H0776 whereon thy feet H7272 have trodden H1869 (8804) shall be thine inheritance H5159, and thy children’s H1121 for H5704 ever H5769, because thou hast wholly H4390 (8765) followed H0310 the LORD H3068 my God H0430.
014:010 And now, behold, the LORD H3068 hath kept me alive H2421 (8689), as he said H1696 (8765), these forty H0705 and five H2568 years H8141, even since H0227 the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) this word H1697 unto Moses H4872, while [the children of] Israel H3478 wandered H1980 (8804) in the wilderness H4057: and now, lo, I [am] this day H3117 fourscore H8084 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121.
014:011 As yet I [am as] strong H2389 this day H3117 as [I was] in the day H3117 that Moses H4872 sent H7971 (8800) me: as my strength H3581 [was] then, even so [is] my strength H3581 now, for war H4421, both to go out H3318 (8800), and to come in H0935 (8800).
014:012 Now therefore give H5414 (8798) me this mountain H2022, whereof the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) in that day H3117; for thou heardest H8085 (8804) in that day H3117 how the Anakims H6062 [were] there, and [that] the cities H5892 [were] great H1419 [and] fenced H1219 (8803): if so be H0194 the LORD H3068 [will be] with H0854 me, then I shall be able to drive them out H3423 (8689), as the LORD H3068 said H1696 (8765).
014:013 And Joshua H3091 blessed H1288 (8762) him, and gave H5414 (8799) unto Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312 Hebron H2275 for an inheritance H5159.
014:014 Hebron H2275 therefore became the inheritance H5159 of Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312 the Kenezite H7074 unto this day H3117, because that he wholly H4390 (8765) followed H0310 the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
014:015 And the name H8034 of Hebron H2275 before H6440 [was] Kirjatharba H7153; [which Arba was] a great H1419 man H0120 among the Anakims H6062. And the land H0776 had rest H8252 (8804) from war H4421.
015:001 ¶  [This] then was the lot H1486 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Judah H3063 by their families H4940; [even] to the border H1366 of Edom H0123 the wilderness H4057 of Zin H6790 southward H5045 [was] the uttermost part H7097 of the south coast H8486.
015:002 And their south H5045 border H1366 was from the shore H7097 of the salt H4417 sea H3220, from the bay H3956 that looketh H6437 (8802) southward H5045:
015:003 And it went out H3318 (8804) to the south side H5045 to Maalehacrabbim H4610, and passed H5674 (8804) along to Zin H6790, and ascended up H5927 (8804) on the south side H5045 unto Kadeshbarnea H6947, and passed H5674 (8804) along to Hezron H2696, and went up H5927 (8804) to Adar H0146, and fetched a compass H5437 (8738) to Karkaa H7173:
015:004 [From thence] it passed H5674 (8804) toward Azmon H6111, and went out H3318 (8804) unto the river H5158 of Egypt H4714; and the goings out H8444 of that coast H1366 were at the sea H3220: this shall be your south H5045 coast H1366.
015:005 And the east H6924 border H1366 [was] the salt H4417 sea H3220, [even] unto the end H7097 of Jordan H3383. And [their] border H1366 in the north H6828 quarter H6285 [was] from the bay H3956 of the sea H3220 at the uttermost part H7097 of Jordan H3383:
015:006 And the border H1366 went up H5927 (8804) to Bethhogla H1031, and passed H5674 (8804) along by the north H6828 of Betharabah H1026; and the border H1366 went up H5927 (8804) to the stone H0068 of Bohan H0932 the son H1121 of Reuben H7205:
015:007 And the border H1366 went up H5927 (8804) toward Debir H1688 from the valley H6010 of Achor H5911, and so northward H6828, looking H6437 (8802) toward Gilgal H1537, that [is] before H5227 the going up H4608 to Adummim H0131, which [is] on the south side H5045 of the river H5158: and the border H1366 passed H5674 (8804) toward the waters H4325 of Enshemesh H5885, and the goings out H8444 thereof were at Enrogel H5883:
015:008 And the border H1366 went up H5927 (8804) by the valley H1516 of the son H1121 of Hinnom H2011 unto the south H5045 side H3802 of the Jebusite H2983; the same [is] Jerusalem H3389: and the border H1366 went up H5927 (8804) to the top H7218 of the mountain H2022 that [lieth] before H6440 the valley H1516 of Hinnom H2011 westward H3220, which [is] at the end H7097 of the valley H6010 of the giants H7497 northward H6828:
015:009 And the border H1366 was drawn H8388 (8804) from the top H7218 of the hill H2022 unto the fountain H4599 of the water H4325 of Nephtoah H5318, and went out H3318 (8804) to the cities H5892 of mount H2022 Ephron H6085; and the border H1366 was drawn H8388 (8804) to Baalah H1173, which [is] Kirjathjearim H7157:
015:010 And the border H1366 compassed H5437 (8738) from Baalah H1173 westward H3220 unto mount H2022 Seir H8165, and passed H5674 (8804) along unto the side H3802 of mount H2022 Jearim H3297, which [is] Chesalon H3693, on the north side H6828, and went down H3381 (8804) to Bethshemesh H1053, and passed on H5674 (8804) to Timnah H8553:
015:011 And the border H1366 went out H3318 (8804) unto the side H3802 of Ekron H6138 northward H6828: and the border H1366 was drawn H8388 (8804) to Shicron H7942, and passed along H5674 (8804) to mount H2022 Baalah H1173, and went out H3318 (8804) unto Jabneel H2995; and the goings out H8444 of the border H1366 were at the sea H3220.
015:012 And the west H3220 border H1366 [was] to the great H1419 sea H3220, and the coast H1366 [thereof]. This [is] the coast H1366 of the children H1121 of Judah H3063 round about H5439 according to their families H4940.
015:013 And unto Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312 he gave H5414 (8804) a part H2506 among H8432 the children H1121 of Judah H3063, according H0413 to the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 to Joshua H3091, [even] the city H7151 of Arba H0704 (8677) H7153 the father H0001 of Anak H6061, which [city is] Hebron H2275.
015:014 And Caleb H3612 drove H3423 (8686) thence the three H7969 sons H1121 of Anak H6061, Sheshai H8344, and Ahiman H0289, and Talmai H8526, the children H3211 of Anak H6061.
015:015 And he went up H5927 (8799) thence to the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Debir H1688: and the name H8034 of Debir H1688 before H6440 [was] Kirjathsepher H7158.
015:016 And Caleb H3612 said H0559 (8799), He that smiteth H5221 (8686) Kirjathsepher H7158, and taketh H3920 (8804) it, to him will I give H5414 (8804) Achsah H5915 my daughter H1323 to wife H0802.
015:017 And Othniel H6274 the son H1121 of Kenaz H7073, the brother H0251 of Caleb H3612, took H3920 (8799) it: and he gave H5414 (8799) him Achsah H5915 his daughter H1323 to wife H0802.
015:018 And it came to pass, as she came H0935 (8800) [unto him], that she moved H5496 (8686) him to ask H7592 (8800) of her father H0001 a field H7704: and she lighted off H6795 (8799) [her] ass H2543; and Caleb H3612 said H0559 (8799) unto her, What wouldest thou?
015:019 Who answered H0559 (8799), Give H5414 (8798) me a blessing H1293; for thou hast given H5414 (8804) me a south H5045 land H0776; give H5414 (8804) me also springs H1543 of water H4325. And he gave H5414 (8799) her the upper H5942 springs H1543, and the nether H8482 springs H1543.
015:020 This [is] the inheritance H5159 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Judah H3063 according to their families H4940.
015:021 And the uttermost H7097 cities H5892 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Judah H3063 toward the coast H1366 of Edom H0123 southward H5045 were Kabzeel H6909, and Eder H5740, and Jagur H3017,

015:062 And Nibshan H5044, and the city of Salt H5898, and Engedi H5872; six H8337 cities H5892 with their villages H2691.
015:063 As for the Jebusites H2983 the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, the children H1121 of Judah H3063 could H3201 (8804) (8675) H3201 (8799) not drive them out H3423 (8687): but the Jebusites H2983 dwell H3427 (8799) with the children H1121 of Judah H3063 at Jerusalem H3389 unto this day H3117.
016:001 ¶  And the lot H1486 of the children H1121 of Joseph H3130 fell H3318 (8799) from Jordan H3383 by Jericho H3405, unto the water H4325 of Jericho H3405 on the east H4217, to the wilderness H4057 that goeth up H5927 (8802) from Jericho H3405 throughout mount H2022 Bethel H1008,
016:002 And goeth out H3318 (8804) from Bethel H1008 to Luz H3870, and passeth along H5674 (8804) unto the borders H1366 of Archi H0757 to Ataroth H5852,
016:003 And goeth down H3381 (8804) westward H3220 to the coast H1366 of Japhleti H3311, unto the coast H1366 of Bethhoron H1032 the nether H8481, and to Gezer H1507: and the goings out H8444 thereof are at the sea H3220.
016:004 So the children H1121 of Joseph H3130, Manasseh H4519 and Ephraim H0669, took their inheritance H5157 (8799).
016:005 And the border H1366 of the children H1121 of Ephraim H0669 according to their families H4940 was [thus]: even the border H1366 of their inheritance H5159 on the east side H4217 was Atarothaddar H5853, unto Bethhoron H1032 the upper H5945;
016:006 And the border H1366 went out H3318 (8804) toward the sea H3220 to Michmethah H4366 on the north side H6828; and the border H1366 went about H5437 (8738) eastward H4217 unto Taanathshiloh H8387, and passed H5674 (8804) by it on the east H4217 to Janohah H3239;
016:007 And it went down H3381 (8804) from Janohah H3239 to Ataroth H5852, and to Naarath H5292, and came H6293 (8804) to Jericho H3405, and went out H3318 (8804) at Jordan H3383.
016:008 The border H1366 went out H3212 (8799) from Tappuah H8599 westward H3220 unto the river H5158 Kanah H7071; and the goings out H8444 thereof were at the sea H3220. This [is] the inheritance H5159 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Ephraim H0669 by their families H4940.
016:009 And the separate H3995 cities H5892 for the children H1121 of Ephraim H0669 [were] among H8432 the inheritance H5159 of the children H1121 of Manasseh H4519, all the cities H5892 with their villages H2691.
016:010 And they drave not out H3423 (8689) the Canaanites H3669 that dwelt H3427 (8802) in Gezer H1507: but the Canaanites H3669 dwell H3427 (8799) among H7130 the Ephraimites H0669 unto this day H3117, and serve H5647 (8802) under tribute H4522.
017:001 ¶  There was also a lot H1486 for the tribe H4294 of Manasseh H4519; for he [was] the firstborn H1060 of Joseph H3130; [to wit], for Machir H4353 the firstborn H1060 of Manasseh H4519, the father H0001 of Gilead H1568: because he was a man H0376 of war H4421, therefore he had Gilead H1568 and Bashan H1316.
017:002 There was also [a lot] for the rest H3498 (8737) of the children H1121 of Manasseh H4519 by their families H4940; for the children H1121 of Abiezer H0044, and for the children H1121 of Helek H2507, and for the children H1121 of Asriel H0844, and for the children H1121 of Shechem H7928, and for the children H1121 of Hepher H2660, and for the children H1121 of Shemida H8061: these [were] the male H2145 children H1121 of Manasseh H4519 the son H1121 of Joseph H3130 by their families H4940.
017:003 But Zelophehad H6765, the son H1121 of Hepher H2660, the son H1121 of Gilead H1568, the son H1121 of Machir H4353, the son H1121 of Manasseh H4519, had no sons H1121, but daughters H1323: and these [are] the names H8034 of his daughters H1323, Mahlah H4244, and Noah H5270, Hoglah H2295, Milcah H4435, and Tirzah H8656.
017:004 And they came near H7126 (8799) before H6440 Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and before H6440 Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, and before H6440 the princes H5387, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872 to give H5414 (8800) us an inheritance H5159 among H8432 our brethren H0251. Therefore according to the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 he gave H5414 (8799) them an inheritance H5159 among H8432 the brethren H0251 of their father H0001.
017:005 And there fell H5307 (8799) ten H6235 portions H2256 to Manasseh H4519, beside the land H0776 of Gilead H1568 and Bashan H1316, which [were] on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383;
017:006 Because the daughters H1323 of Manasseh H4519 had H5157 (8804) an inheritance H5159 among H8432 his sons H1121: and the rest H3498 (8737) of Manasseh’s H4519 sons H1121 had the land H0776 of Gilead H1568.
017:007 And the coast H1366 of Manasseh H4519 was from Asher H0836 to Michmethah H4366, that [lieth] before H6440 Shechem H7927; and the border H1366 went along H1980 (8804) on the right hand H3225 unto the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Entappuah H5887.
017:008 [Now] Manasseh H4519 had the land H0776 of Tappuah H8599: but Tappuah H8599 on the border H1366 of Manasseh H4519 [belonged] to the children H1121 of Ephraim H0669;
017:009 And the coast H1366 descended H3381 (8804) unto the river H5158 Kanah H7071, southward H5045 of the river H5158: these cities H5892 of Ephraim H0669 [are] among H8432 the cities H5892 of Manasseh H4519: the coast H1366 of Manasseh H4519 also [was] on the north side H6828 of the river H5158, and the outgoings H8444 of it were at the sea H3220:
017:010 Southward H5045 [it was] Ephraim’s H0669, and northward H6828 [it was] Manasseh’s H4519, and the sea H3220 is his border H1366; and they met together H6293 (8799) in Asher H0836 on the north H6828, and in Issachar H3485 on the east H4217.
017:011 And Manasseh H4519 had in Issachar H3485 and in Asher H0836 Bethshean H1052 and her towns H1323, and Ibleam H2991 and her towns H1323, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Dor H1756 and her towns H1323, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Endor H5874 and her towns H1323, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Taanach H8590 and her towns H1323, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Megiddo H4023 and her towns H1323, [even] three H7969 countries H5316.
017:012 Yet the children H1121 of Manasseh H4519 could H3201 (8804) not drive out H3423 (8687) [the inhabitants of] those cities H5892; but the Canaanites H3669 would H2974 (8686) dwell H3427 (8800) in that land H0776.
017:013 Yet it came to pass, when the children H1121 of Israel H3478 were waxen strong H2388 (8804), that they put H5414 (8799) the Canaanites H3669 to tribute H4522; but did not utterly H3423 (8687) drive them out H3423 (8689).
017:014 And the children H1121 of Joseph H3130 spake H1696 (8762) unto Joshua H3091, saying H0559 (8800), Why hast thou given H5414 (8804) me [but] one H0259 lot H1486 and one H0259 portion H2256 to inherit H5159, seeing I [am] a great H7227 people H5971, forasmuch as H5704 the LORD H3068 hath blessed H1288 (8765) me hitherto H3541?
017:015 And Joshua H3091 answered H0559 (8799) them, If thou [be] a great H7227 people H5971, [then] get thee up H5927 (8798) to the wood H3293 [country], and cut down H1254 (8765) for thyself there in the land H0776 of the Perizzites H6522 and of the giants H7497, if mount H2022 Ephraim H0669 be too narrow H0213 (8804) for thee.
017:016 And the children H1121 of Joseph H3130 said H0559 (8799), The hill H2022 is not enough H4672 (8735) for us: and all the Canaanites H3669 that dwell H3427 (8802) in the land H0776 of the valley H6010 have chariots H7393 of iron H1270, [both they] who [are] of Bethshean H1052 and her towns H1323, and [they] who [are] of the valley H6010 of Jezreel H3157.
017:017 And Joshua H3091 spake H0559 (8799) unto the house H1004 of Joseph H3130, [even] to Ephraim H0669 and to Manasseh H4519, saying H0559 (8800), Thou [art] a great H7227 people H5971, and hast great H1419 power H3581: thou shalt not have one H0259 lot H1486 [only]:
017:018 But the mountain H2022 shall be thine; for it [is] a wood H3293, and thou shalt cut it down H1254 (8765): and the outgoings H8444 of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out H3423 (8686) the Canaanites H3669, though they have iron H1270 chariots H7393, [and] though they [be] strong H2389.
018:001 ¶  And the whole congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 assembled together H6950 (8735) at Shiloh H7887, and set up H7931 (8686) the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 there. And the land H0776 was subdued H3533 (8738) before H6440 them.
018:002 And there remained H3498 (8735) among the children H1121 of Israel H3478 seven H7651 tribes H7626, which had not yet received H2505 (8804) their inheritance H5159.
018:003 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, How long [are] ye slack H7503 (8693) to go H0935 (8800) to possess H3423 (8800) the land H0776, which the LORD H3068 God H0430 of your fathers H0001 hath given H5414 (8804) you?
018:004 Give out H3051 (8798) from among you three H7969 men H0582 for [each] tribe H7626: and I will send H7971 (8799) them, and they shall rise H6965 (8799), and go H1980 (8691) through the land H0776, and describe H3789 (8799) it according H6310 to the inheritance H5159 of them; and they shall come H0935 (8799) [again] to me.
018:005 And they shall divide H2505 (8694) it into seven H7651 parts H2506: Judah H3063 shall abide H5975 (8799) in their coast H1366 on the south H5045, and the house H1004 of Joseph H3130 shall abide H5975 (8799) in their coasts H1366 on the north H6828.
018:006 Ye shall therefore describe H3789 (8799) the land H0776 [into] seven H7651 parts H2506, and bring H0935 (8689) [the description] hither to me, that I may cast H3384 (8804) lots H1486 for you here before H6440 the LORD H3068 our God H0430.
018:007 But the Levites H3881 have no part H2506 among H7130 you; for the priesthood H3550 of the LORD H3068 [is] their inheritance H5159: and Gad H1410, and Reuben H7205, and half H2677 the tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519, have received H3947 (8804) their inheritance H5159 beyond H5676 Jordan H3383 on the east H4217, which Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8804) them.
018:008 And the men H0582 arose H6965 (8799), and went away H3212 (8799): and Joshua H3091 charged H6680 (8762) them that went H1980 (8802) to describe H3789 (8800) the land H0776, saying H0559 (8800), Go H3212 (8798) and walk H1980 (8690) through the land H0776, and describe H3789 (8798) it, and come again H7725 (8798) to me, that I may here cast H7993 (8686) lots H1486 for you before H6440 the LORD H3068 in Shiloh H7887.
018:009 And the men H0582 went H3212 (8799) and passed through H5674 (8799) the land H0776, and described H3789 (8799) it by cities H5892 into seven H7651 parts H2506 in a book H5612, and came H0935 (8799) [again] to Joshua H3091 to the host H4264 at Shiloh H7887.
018:010 And Joshua H3091 cast H7993 (8686) lots H1486 for them in Shiloh H7887 before H6440 the LORD H3068: and there Joshua H3091 divided H2505 (8762) the land H0776 unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478 according to their divisions H4256.
018:011 And the lot H1486 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 came up H5927 (8799) according to their families H4940: and the coast H1366 of their lot H1486 came forth H3318 (8799) between the children H1121 of Judah H3063 and the children H1121 of Joseph H3130.
018:012 And their border H1366 on the north H6828 side H6285 was from Jordan H3383; and the border H1366 went up H5927 (8804) to the side H3802 of Jericho H3405 on the north H6828 side, and went up H5927 (8804) through the mountains H2022 westward H3220; and the goings out H8444 thereof were at the wilderness H4057 of Bethaven H1007.

019:009 Out of the portion H2256 of the children H1121 of Judah H3063 [was] the inheritance H5159 of the children H1121 of Simeon H8095: for the part H2506 of the children H1121 of Judah H3063 was too much H7227 for them: therefore the children H1121 of Simeon H8095 had their inheritance H5157 (8799) within H8432 the inheritance H5159 of them.

019:050 According to the word H6310 of the LORD H3068 they gave H5414 (8804) him the city H5892 which he asked H7592 (8804), [even] Timnathserah H8556 in mount H2022 Ephraim H0669: and he built H1129 (8799) the city H5892, and dwelt H3427 (8799) therein.
019:051 These [are] the inheritances H5159, which Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, and the heads H7218 of the fathers H0001 of the tribes H4294 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, divided for an inheritance H5157 (8765) by lot H1486 in Shiloh H7887 before H6440 the LORD H3068, at the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150. So they made an end H3615 (8762) of dividing H2505 (8763) the country H0776.
020:001 ¶  The LORD H3068 also spake H1696 (8762) unto Joshua H3091, saying H0559 (8800),
020:002 Speak H1696 (8761) to the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Appoint out H5414 (8798) for you cities H5892 of refuge H4733, whereof I spake H1696 (8765) unto you by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872:
020:003 That the slayer H7523 (8802) that killeth H5221 (8688) [any] person H5315 unawares H7684 [and] unwittingly H1847 may flee H5127 (8800) thither: and they shall be your refuge H4733 from the avenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818.
020:004 And when he that doth flee H5127 (8804) unto one H0259 of those cities H5892 shall stand H5975 (8804) at the entering H6607 of the gate H8179 of the city H5892, and shall declare H1696 (8765) his cause H1697 in the ears H0241 of the elders H2205 of that city H5892, they shall take H0622 (8804) him into the city H5892 unto them, and give H5414 (8804) him a place H4725, that he may dwell H3427 (8804) among them.
020:005 And if the avenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818 pursue H7291 (8799) after H0310 him, then they shall not deliver H5462 (8686) the slayer H7523 (8802) up into his hand H3027; because he smote H5221 (8689) his neighbour H7453 unwittingly H1097 H1847, and hated H8130 (8802) him not beforetime H8543 H8032.
020:006 And he shall dwell H3427 (8804) in that city H5892, until he stand H5975 (8800) before H6440 the congregation H5712 for judgment H4941, [and] until the death H4194 of the high H1419 priest H3548 that H0834 shall be in those days H3117: then shall the slayer H7523 (8802) return H7725 (8799), and come H0935 (8804) unto his own city H5892, and unto his own house H1004, unto the city H5892 from whence he fled H5127 (8804).
020:007 And they appointed H6942 (8686) Kedesh H6943 in Galilee H1551 in mount H2022 Naphtali H5321, and Shechem H7927 in mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, and Kirjatharba H7153, which [is] Hebron H2275, in the mountain H2022 of Judah H3063.
020:008 And on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383 by Jericho H3405 eastward H4217, they assigned H5414 (8804) Bezer H1221 in the wilderness H4057 upon the plain H4334 out of the tribe H4294 of Reuben H7205, and Ramoth H7216 in Gilead H1568 out of the tribe H4294 of Gad H1410, and Golan H1474 in Bashan H1316 out of the tribe H4294 of Manasseh H4519.
020:009 These were the cities H5892 appointed H4152 for all the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and for the stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) among H8432 them, that whosoever killeth H5221 (8688) [any] person H5315 at unawares H7684 might flee H5127 (8800) thither, and not die H4191 (8799) by the hand H3027 of the avenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818, until he stood H5975 (8800) before H6440 the congregation H5712.
021:001 ¶  Then came near H5066 (8799) the heads H7218 of the fathers H0001 of the Levites H3881 unto Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and unto Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, and unto the heads H7218 of the fathers H0001 of the tribes H4294 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478;
021:002 And they spake H1696 (8762) unto them at Shiloh H7887 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872 to give H5414 (8800) us cities H5892 to dwell in H3427 (8800), with the suburbs H4054 thereof for our cattle H0929.
021:003 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 gave H5414 (8799) unto the Levites H3881 out of their inheritance H5159, at the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068, these cities H5892 and their suburbs H4054.
021:004 And the lot H1486 came out H3318 (8799) for the families H4940 of the Kohathites H6956: and the children H1121 of Aaron H0175 the priest H3548, [which were] of the Levites H3881, had by lot H1486 out of the tribe H4294 of Judah H3063, and out of the tribe H4294 of Simeon H8099, and out of the tribe H4294 of Benjamin H1144, thirteen H7969 H6240 cities H5892.
021:005 And the rest H3498 (8737) of the children H1121 of Kohath H6955 [had] by lot H1486 out of the families H4940 of the tribe H4294 of Ephraim H0669, and out of the tribe H4294 of Dan H1835, and out of the half H2677 tribe H4294 of Manasseh H4519, ten H6235 cities H5892.
021:006 And the children H1121 of Gershon H1648 [had] by lot H1486 out of the families H4940 of the tribe H4294 of Issachar H3485, and out of the tribe H4294 of Asher H0836, and out of the tribe H4294 of Naphtali H5321, and out of the half H2677 tribe H4294 of Manasseh H4519 in Bashan H1316, thirteen H7969 H6240 cities H5892.

021:008 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 gave H5414 (8799) by lot H1486 unto the Levites H3881 these cities H5892 with their suburbs H4054, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
021:009 And they gave H5414 (8799) out of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Judah H3063, and out of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Simeon H8095, these cities H5892 which are [here] mentioned H7121 (8799) by name H8034,
021:010 Which the children H1121 of Aaron H0175, [being] of the families H4940 of the Kohathites H6956, [who were] of the children H1121 of Levi H3878, had: for theirs was the first H7223 (8675) H7223 lot H1486.
021:011 And they gave H5414 (8799) them the city H7151 of Arba H0704 (8677) H7153 the father H0001 of Anak H6061, which [city is] Hebron H2275, in the hill H2022 [country] of Judah H3063, with the suburbs H4054 thereof round about H5439 it.

021:020 And the families H4940 of the children H1121 of Kohath H6955, the Levites H3881 which remained H3498 (8737) of the children H1121 of Kohath H6955, even they had the cities H5892 of their lot H1486 out of the tribe H4294 of Ephraim H0669.
021:021 For they gave H5414 (8799) them Shechem H7927 with her suburbs H4054 in mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, [to be] a city H5892 of refuge H4733 for the slayer H7523 (8802); and Gezer H1507 with her suburbs H4054,

021:027 And unto the children H1121 of Gershon H1648, of the families H4940 of the Levites H3881, out of the [other] half H2677 tribe H4294 of Manasseh H4519 [they gave] Golan H1474 in Bashan H1316 with her suburbs H4054, [to be] a city H5892 of refuge H4733 for the slayer H7523 (8802); and Beeshterah H1203 with her suburbs H4054; two H8147 cities H5892.

021:032 And out of the tribe H4294 of Naphtali H5321, Kedesh H6943 in Galilee H1551 with her suburbs H4054, [to be] a city H5892 of refuge H4733 for the slayer H7523 (8802); and Hammothdor H2576 with her suburbs H4054, and Kartan H7178 with her suburbs H4054; three H7969 cities H5892.
021:033 All the cities H5892 of the Gershonites H1649 according to their families H4940 [were] thirteen H7969 H6240 cities H5892 with their suburbs H4054.
021:034 And unto the families H4940 of the children H1121 of Merari H4847, the rest H3498 (8737) of the Levites H3881, out of the tribe H4294 of Zebulun H2074, Jokneam H3362 with her suburbs H4054, and Kartah H7177 with her suburbs H4054,
021:035 Dimnah H1829 with her suburbs H4054, Nahalal H5096 with her suburbs H4054; four H0702 cities H5892.
021:036 And out of the tribe of Reuben H7205, Bezer H1221 with her suburbs, and Jahazah H3096 with her suburbs,

021:039 Heshbon H2809 with her suburbs H4054, Jazer H3270 with her suburbs H4054; four H0702 cities H5892 in all.
021:040 So all the cities H5892 for the children H1121 of Merari H4847 by their families H4940, which were remaining H3498 (8737) of the families H4940 of the Levites H3881, were [by] their lot H1486 twelve H8147 H6240 cities H5892.
021:041 All the cities H5892 of the Levites H3881 within H8432 the possession H0272 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 [were] forty H0705 and eight H8083 cities H5892 with their suburbs H4054.
021:042 These cities H5892 were every one H5892 H5892 with their suburbs H4054 round about H5439 them: thus [were] all these cities H5892.
021:043 And the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8799) unto Israel H3478 all the land H0776 which he sware H7650 (8738) to give H5414 (8800) unto their fathers H0001; and they possessed H3423 (8799) it, and dwelt H3427 (8799) therein.
021:044 And the LORD H3068 gave them rest H5117 (8799) round about H5439, according to all that he sware H7650 (8738) unto their fathers H0001: and there stood H5975 (8804) not a man H0376 of all their enemies H0341 (8802) before H6440 them; the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8804) all their enemies H0341 (8802) into their hand H3027.
021:045 There failed H5307 (8804) not ought H1697 of any good H2896 thing H1697 which the LORD H3068 had spoken H1696 (8765) unto the house H1004 of Israel H3478; all came to pass H0935 (8802).
022:001 ¶  Then Joshua H3091 called H7121 (8799) the Reubenites H7206, and the Gadites H1425, and the half H2677 tribe H4294 of Manasseh H4519,
022:002 And said H0559 (8799) unto them, Ye have kept H8104 (8804) all that Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) you, and have obeyed H8085 (8799) my voice H6963 in all that I commanded H6680 (8765) you:
022:003 Ye have not left H5800 (8804) your brethren H0251 these many H7227 days H3117 unto this day H3117, but have kept H8104 (8804) the charge H4931 of the commandment H4687 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
022:004 And now the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath given rest H5117 (8689) unto your brethren H0251, as he promised H1696 (8765) them: therefore now return H6437 (8798) ye, and get H3212 (8798) you unto your tents H0168, [and] unto the land H0776 of your possession H0272, which Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8804) you on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383.
022:005 But take diligent H3966 heed H8104 (8798) to do H6213 (8800) the commandment H4687 and the law H8451, which Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 charged H6680 (8765) you, to love H0157 (8800) the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and to walk H3212 (8800) in all his ways H1870, and to keep H8104 (8800) his commandments H4687, and to cleave H1692 (8800) unto him, and to serve H5647 (8800) him with all your heart H3824 and with all your soul H5315.
022:006 So Joshua H3091 blessed H1288 (8762) them, and sent them away H7971 (8762): and they went H3212 (8799) unto their tents H0168.
022:007 Now to the [one] half H2677 of the tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519 Moses H4872 had given H5414 (8804) [possession] in Bashan H1316: but unto the [other] half H2677 thereof gave H5414 (8804) Joshua H3091 among H5973 their brethren H0251 on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 westward H3220. And when Joshua H3091 sent them away H7971 (8765) also unto their tents H0168, then he blessed H1288 (8762) them,
022:008 And he spake H0559 (8799) unto them, saying H0559 (8800), Return H7725 (8798) with much H7227 riches H5233 unto your tents H0168, and with very H3966 much H7227 cattle H4735, with silver H3701, and with gold H2091, and with brass H5178, and with iron H1270, and with very H3966 much H7235 (8687) raiment H8008: divide H2505 (8798) the spoil H7998 of your enemies H0341 (8802) with your brethren H0251.
022:009 And the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 and the children H1121 of Gad H1410 and the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519 returned H7725 (8799), and departed H3212 (8799) from the children H1121 of Israel H3478 out of Shiloh H7887, which [is] in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, to go H3212 (8800) unto the country H0776 of Gilead H1568, to the land H0776 of their possession H0272, whereof they were possessed H0270 (8738), according to the word H6310 of the LORD H3068 by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
022:010 And when they came H0935 (8799) unto the borders H1552 of Jordan H3383, that [are] in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 and the children H1121 of Gad H1410 and the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519 built H1129 (8799) there an altar H4196 by Jordan H3383, a great H1419 altar H4196 to see to H4758.
022:011 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 heard H8085 (8799) say H0559 (8800), Behold, the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 and the children H1121 of Gad H1410 and the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519 have built H1129 (8804) an altar H4196 over against H4136 the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, in the borders H1552 of Jordan H3383, at the passage H5676 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
022:012 And when the children H1121 of Israel H3478 heard H8085 (8799) [of it], the whole congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 gathered themselves together H6950 (8735) at Shiloh H7887, to go up H5927 (8800) to war H6635 against them.
022:013 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 sent H7971 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Reuben H7205, and to the children H1121 of Gad H1410, and to the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519, into the land H0776 of Gilead H1568, Phinehas H6372 the son H1121 of Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548,
022:014 And with him ten H6235 princes H5387, of each H0259 H0259 chief H5387 H5387 house H1004 a prince H0001 throughout all the tribes H4294 of Israel H3478; and each one H0376 [was] an head H7218 of the house H1004 of their fathers H0001 among the thousands H0505 of Israel H3478.
022:015 And they came H0935 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Reuben H7205, and to the children H1121 of Gad H1410, and to the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519, unto the land H0776 of Gilead H1568, and they spake H1696 (8762) with them, saying H0559 (8800),
022:016 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the whole congregation H5712 of the LORD H3068, What trespass H4604 [is] this that ye have committed H4603 (8804) against the God H0430 of Israel H3478, to turn away H7725 (8800) this day H3117 from following H0310 the LORD H3068, in that ye have builded H1129 (8800) you an altar H4196, that ye might rebel H4775 (8800) this day H3117 against the LORD H3068?
022:017 [Is] the iniquity H5771 of Peor H6465 too little H4592 for us, from which we are not cleansed H2891 (8694) until this day H3117, although there was a plague H5063 in the congregation H5712 of the LORD H3068,
022:018 But that ye must turn away H7725 (8799) this day H3117 from following H0310 the LORD H3068? and it will be, [seeing] ye rebel H4775 (8799) to day H3117 against the LORD H3068, that to morrow H4279 he will be wroth H7107 (8799) with the whole congregation H5712 of Israel H3478.
022:019 Notwithstanding H0389, if the land H0776 of your possession H0272 [be] unclean H2931, [then] pass ye over H5674 (8798) unto the land H0776 of the possession H0272 of the LORD H3068, wherein the LORD’S H3068 tabernacle H4908 dwelleth H7931 (8804), and take possession H0270 (8734) among H8432 us: but rebel H4775 (8799) not against the LORD H3068, nor H0408 rebel H4775 (8799) against us, in building H1129 (8800) you an altar H4196 beside H1107 the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430.
022:020 Did not Achan H5912 the son H1121 of Zerah H2226 commit H4603 (8804) a trespass H4604 in the accursed thing H2764, and wrath H7110 fell H1961 (8804) on all the congregation H5712 of Israel H3478? and that man H0376 perished H1478 (8804) not alone H0259 in his iniquity H5771.
022:021 Then the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 and the children H1121 of Gad H1410 and the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519 answered H6030 (8799), and said H1696 (8762) unto the heads H7218 of the thousands H0505 of Israel H3478,
022:022 The LORD H3068 God H0410 of gods H0430, the LORD H3068 God H0410 of gods H0430, he knoweth H3045 (8802), and Israel H3478 he shall know H3045 (8799); if [it be] in rebellion H4777, or if in transgression H4604 against the LORD H3068, (save H3467 (8686) us not this day H3117,)
022:023 That we have built H1129 (8800) us an altar H4196 to turn H7725 (8800) from following H0310 the LORD H3068, or if to offer H5927 (8687) thereon burnt offering H5930 or meat offering H4503, or if to offer H6213 (8800) peace H8002 offerings H2077 thereon, let the LORD H3068 himself require H1245 (8762) [it];
022:024 And if we have not [rather] done H6213 (8804) it for fear H1674 of [this] thing H1697, saying H0559 (8800), In time to come H4279 your children H1121 might speak H0559 (8799) unto our children H1121, saying H0559 (8800), What have ye to do with the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478?
022:025 For the LORD H3068 hath made H5414 (8804) Jordan H3383 a border H1366 between us and you, ye children H1121 of Reuben H7205 and children H1121 of Gad H1410; ye have no part H2506 in the LORD H3068: so shall your children H1121 make H7673 our children H1121 cease H7673 (8689) from H1115 fearing H3372 (8800) the LORD H3068.
022:026 Therefore we said H0559 (8799), Let us now prepare H6213 (8799) to build H1129 (8800) us an altar H4196, not for burnt offering H5930, nor for sacrifice H2077:
022:027 But [that] it [may be] a witness H5707 between us, and you, and our generations H1755 after H0310 us, that we might do H5647 (8800) the service H5656 of the LORD H3068 before H6440 him with our burnt offerings H5930, and with our sacrifices H2077, and with our peace offerings H8002; that your children H1121 may not say H0559 (8799) to our children H1121 in time to come H4279, Ye have no part H2506 in the LORD H3068.
022:028 Therefore said H0559 (8799) we, that it shall be, when they should [so] say H0559 (8799) to us or to our generations H1755 in time to come H4279, that we may say H0559 (8804) [again], Behold H7200 (8798) the pattern H8403 of the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068, which our fathers H0001 made H6213 (8804), not for burnt offerings H5930, nor for sacrifices H2077; but it [is] a witness H5707 between us and you.
022:029 God forbid H2486 that we should rebel H4775 (8800) against the LORD H3068, and turn H7725 (8800) this day H3117 from following H0310 the LORD H3068, to build H1129 (8800) an altar H4196 for burnt offerings H5930, for meat offerings H4503, or for sacrifices H2077, beside the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430 that [is] before H6440 his tabernacle H4908.
022:030 And when Phinehas H6372 the priest H3548, and the princes H5387 of the congregation H5712 and heads H7218 of the thousands H0505 of Israel H3478 which [were] with him, heard H8085 (8799) the words H1697 that the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 and the children H1121 of Gad H1410 and the children H1121 of Manasseh H4519 spake H1696 (8765), it pleased H3190 (8799) H5869 them.
022:031 And Phinehas H6372 the son H1121 of Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548 said H0559 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Reuben H7205, and to the children H1121 of Gad H1410, and to the children H1121 of Manasseh H4519, This day H3117 we perceive H3045 (8804) that the LORD H3068 [is] among H8432 us, because ye have not committed H4603 (8804) this trespass H4604 against the LORD H3068: now H0227 ye have delivered H5337 (8689) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 out of the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068.
022:032 And Phinehas H6372 the son H1121 of Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and the princes H5387, returned H7725 (8799) from the children H1121 of Reuben H7205, and from the children H1121 of Gad H1410, out of the land H0776 of Gilead H1568, unto the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, to the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and brought H7725 them word H1697 again H7725 (8686).
022:033 And the thing H1697 pleased H3190 (8799) H5869 the children H1121 of Israel H3478; and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 blessed H1288 (8762) God H0430, and did not intend H0559 (8804) to go up H5927 (8800) against them in battle H6635, to destroy H7843 (8763) the land H0776 wherein the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 and Gad H1410 dwelt H3427 (8802).
022:034 And the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 and the children H1121 of Gad H1410 called H7121 (8799) the altar H4196 [Ed]: for it [shall be] a witness H5707 between us that the LORD H3068 [is] God H0430.
023:001 ¶  And it came to pass a long H7227 time H3117 after H0310 that the LORD H3068 had given rest H5117 (8689) unto Israel H3478 from all their enemies H0341 (8802) round about H5439, that Joshua H3091 waxed old H2204 (8804) [and] stricken H0935 (8804) in age H3117.
023:002 And Joshua H3091 called H7121 (8799) for all Israel H3478, [and] for their elders H2205, and for their heads H7218, and for their judges H8199 (8802), and for their officers H7860 (8802), and said H0559 (8799) unto them, I am old H2204 (8804) [and] stricken H0935 (8804) in age H3117:
023:003 And ye have seen H7200 (8804) all that the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath done H6213 (8804) unto all these nations H1471 because H6440 of you; for the LORD H3068 your God H0430 [is] he that hath fought H3898 (8737) for you.
023:004 Behold H7200 (8798), I have divided H5307 (8689) unto you by lot these nations H1471 that remain H7604 (8737), to be an inheritance H5159 for your tribes H7626, from Jordan H3383, with all the nations H1471 that I have cut off H3772 (8689), even unto the great H1419 sea H3220 westward H3996 H8121.
023:005 And the LORD H3068 your God H0430, he shall expel H1920 (8799) them from before H6440 you, and drive H3423 (8689) them from out of your sight H6440; and ye shall possess H3423 (8804) their land H0776, as the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath promised H1696 (8765) unto you.
023:006 Be ye therefore very H3966 courageous H2388 (8804) to keep H8104 (8800) and to do H6213 (8800) all that is written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the law H8451 of Moses H4872, that ye turn H5493 (8800) not aside therefrom [to] the right hand H3225 or [to] the left H8040;
023:007 That ye come H0935 (8800) not among these nations H1471, these that remain H7604 (8737) among you; neither make mention H2142 (8686) of the name H8034 of their gods H0430, nor cause to swear H7650 (8686) [by them], neither serve H5647 (8799) them, nor bow H7812 (8691) yourselves unto them:
023:008 But cleave H1692 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 your God H0430, as ye have done H6213 (8804) unto this day H3117.
023:009 For the LORD H3068 hath driven out H3423 (8686) from before H6440 you great H1419 nations H1471 and strong H6099: but [as for] you, no man H0376 hath been able to stand H5975 (8804) before H6440 you unto this day H3117.
023:010 One H0259 man H0376 of you shall chase H7291 (8799) a thousand H0505: for the LORD H3068 your God H0430, he [it is] that fighteth H3898 (8737) for you, as he hath promised H1696 (8765) you.
023:011 Take good H3966 heed H8104 (8738) therefore unto yourselves H5315, that ye love H0157 (8800) the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
023:012 Else if ye do in any wise H7725 (8800) go back H7725 (8799), and cleave H1692 (8804) unto the remnant H3499 of these nations H1471, [even] these that remain H7604 (8737) among you, and shall make marriages H2859 (8694) with them, and go in H0935 (8804) unto them, and they to you:
023:013 Know H3045 (8799) for a certainty H3045 (8800) that the LORD H3068 your God H0430 will no more H3254 (8686) drive out H3423 (8687) [any of] these nations H1471 from before H6440 you; but they shall be snares H6341 and traps H4170 unto you, and scourges H7850 in your sides H6654, and thorns H6796 in your eyes H5869, until ye perish H0006 (8800) from off this good H2896 land H0127 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) you.
023:014 And, behold, this day H3117 I [am] going H1980 (8802) the way H1870 of all the earth H0776: and ye know H3045 (8804) in all your hearts H3824 and in all your souls H5315, that not one H0259 thing H1697 hath failed H5307 (8804) of all the good H2896 things H1697 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 spake H1696 (8765) concerning you; all are come to pass H0935 (8804) unto you, [and] not one H0259 thing H1697 hath failed H5307 (8804) thereof.
023:015 Therefore it shall come to pass, [that] as all good H2896 things H1697 are come H0935 (8804) upon you, which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 promised H1696 (8765) you; so shall the LORD H3068 bring H0935 (8686) upon you all evil H7451 things H1697, until he have destroyed H8045 (8687) you from off this good H2896 land H0127 which the LORD H3068 your God H0430 hath given H5414 (8804) you.
023:016 When ye have transgressed H5674 (8800) the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430, which he commanded H6680 (8765) you, and have gone H1980 (8804) and served H5647 (8804) other H0312 gods H0430, and bowed H7812 (8694) yourselves to them; then shall the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 be kindled H2734 (8804) against you, and ye shall perish H0006 (8804) quickly H4120 from off the good H2896 land H0776 which he hath given H5414 (8804) unto you.
024:001 ¶  And Joshua H3091 gathered H0622 (8799) all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 to Shechem H7927, and called H7121 (8799) for the elders H2205 of Israel H3478, and for their heads H7218, and for their judges H8199 (8802), and for their officers H7860 (8802); and they presented H3320 (8691) themselves before H6440 God H0430.
024:002 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto all the people H5971, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, Your fathers H0001 dwelt H3427 (8804) on the other side H5676 of the flood H5104 in old time H5769, [even] Terah H8646, the father H0001 of Abraham H0085, and the father H0001 of Nachor H5152: and they served H5647 (8799) other H0312 gods H0430.
024:003 And I took H3947 (8799) your father H0001 Abraham H0085 from the other side H5676 of the flood H5104, and led H3212 (8686) him throughout all the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, and multiplied H7235 (8686) his seed H2233, and gave H5414 (8799) him Isaac H3327.
024:004 And I gave H5414 (8799) unto Isaac H3327 Jacob H3290 and Esau H6215: and I gave H5414 (8799) unto Esau H6215 mount H2022 Seir H8165, to possess H3423 (8800) it; but Jacob H3290 and his children H1121 went down H3381 (8804) into Egypt H4714.
024:005 I sent H7971 (8799) Moses H4872 also and Aaron H0175, and I plagued H5062 (8799) Egypt H4714, according to that which H0834 I did H6213 (8804) among H7130 them: and afterward H0310 I brought you out H3318 (8689).
024:006 And I brought H3318 (8686) your fathers H0001 out of Egypt H4714: and ye came H0935 (8799) unto the sea H3220; and the Egyptians H4714 pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 your fathers H0001 with chariots H7393 and horsemen H6571 unto the Red H5488 sea H3220.
024:007 And when they cried H6817 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, he put H7760 (8799) darkness H3990 between you and the Egyptians H4713, and brought H0935 (8686) the sea H3220 upon them, and covered H3680 (8762) them; and your eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8799) what I have done H6213 (8804) in Egypt H4714: and ye dwelt H3427 (8799) in the wilderness H4057 a long H7227 season H3117.
024:008 And I brought H0935 (8686) you into the land H0776 of the Amorites H0567, which dwelt H3427 (8802) on the other side H5676 Jordan H3383; and they fought H3898 (8735) with you: and I gave H5414 (8799) them into your hand H3027, that ye might possess H3423 (8799) their land H0776; and I destroyed H8045 (8686) them from before H6440 you.
024:009 Then Balak H1111 the son H1121 of Zippor H6834, king H4428 of Moab H4124, arose H6965 (8799) and warred H3898 (8735) against Israel H3478, and sent H7971 (8799) and called H7121 (8799) Balaam H1109 the son H1121 of Beor H1160 to curse H7043 (8763) you:
024:010 But I would H0014 (8804) not hearken H8085 (8800) unto Balaam H1109; therefore he blessed H1288 (8762) you still H1288 (8800): so I delivered H5337 (8686) you out of his hand H3027.
024:011 And ye went over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383, and came H0935 (8799) unto Jericho H3405: and the men H1167 of Jericho H3405 fought H3898 (8735) against you, the Amorites H0567, and the Perizzites H6522, and the Canaanites H3669, and the Hittites H2850, and the Girgashites H1622, the Hivites H2340, and the Jebusites H2983; and I delivered H5414 (8799) them into your hand H3027.
024:012 And I sent H7971 (8799) the hornet H6880 before H6440 you, which drave them out H1644 (8762) from before H6440 you, [even] the two H8147 kings H4428 of the Amorites H0567; [but] not with thy sword H2719, nor with thy bow H7198.
024:013 And I have given H5414 (8799) you a land H0776 for which ye did not labour H3021 (8804), and cities H5892 which ye built H1129 (8804) not, and ye dwell H3427 (8799) in them; of the vineyards H3754 and oliveyards H2132 which ye planted H5193 (8804) not do ye eat H0398 (8802).
024:014 Now therefore fear H3372 (8798) the LORD H3068, and serve H5647 (8798) him in sincerity H8549 and in truth H0571: and put away H5493 (8685) the gods H0430 which your fathers H0001 served H5647 (8804) on the other side H5676 of the flood H5104, and in Egypt H4714; and serve H5647 (8798) ye the LORD H3068.
024:015 And if it seem evil H7489 (8804) unto you H4310 to serve H5647 (8800) the LORD H3068, choose H0977 (8798) you this day H3117 whom H5869 ye will serve H5647 (8799); whether the gods H0430 which your fathers H0001 served H5647 (8804) that [were] on the other side H5676 of the flood H5104, or the gods H0430 of the Amorites H0567, in whose land H0776 ye dwell H3427 (8802): but as for me and my house H1004, we will serve H5647 (8799) the LORD H3068.
024:016 And the people H5971 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), God forbid H2486 that we should forsake H5800 (8800) the LORD H3068, to serve H5647 (8800) other H0312 gods H0430;
024:017 For the LORD H3068 our God H0430, he [it is] that brought us up H5927 (8688) and our fathers H0001 out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, from the house H1004 of bondage H5650, and which did H6213 (8804) those great H1419 signs H0226 in our sight H5869, and preserved H8104 (8799) us in all the way H1870 wherein we went H1980 (8804), and among all the people H5971 through H7130 whom we passed H5674 (8804):
024:018 And the LORD H3068 drave out H1644 (8762) from before H6440 us all the people H5971, even the Amorites H0567 which dwelt H3427 (8802) in the land H0776: [therefore] will we also serve H5647 (8799) the LORD H3068; for he [is] our God H0430.
024:019 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971, Ye cannot H3201 (8799) serve H5647 (8800) the LORD H3068: for he [is] an holy H6918 God H0430; he [is] a jealous H7072 God H0410; he will not forgive H5375 (8799) your transgressions H6588 nor your sins H2403.
024:020 If ye forsake H5800 (8799) the LORD H3068, and serve H5647 (8804) strange H5236 gods H0430, then he will turn H7725 (8804) and do you hurt H7489 (8689), and consume H3615 (8765) you, after H0310 that he hath done you good H3190 (8689).
024:021 And the people H5971 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, Nay; but we will serve H5647 (8799) the LORD H3068.
024:022 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto the people H5971, Ye [are] witnesses H5707 against yourselves that ye have chosen H0977 (8804) you the LORD H3068, to serve H5647 (8800) him. And they said H0559 (8799), [We are] witnesses H5707.
024:023 Now therefore put away H5493 (8685), [said he], the strange H5236 gods H0430 which [are] among H7130 you, and incline H5186 (8685) your heart H3824 unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
024:024 And the people H5971 said H0559 (8799) unto Joshua H3091, The LORD H3068 our God H0430 will we serve H5647 (8799), and his voice H6963 will we obey H8085 (8799).
024:025 So Joshua H3091 made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 with the people H5971 that day H3117, and set H7760 (8799) them a statute H2706 and an ordinance H4941 in Shechem H7927.
024:026 And Joshua H3091 wrote H3789 (8799) these words H1697 in the book H5612 of the law H8451 of God H0430, and took H3947 (8799) a great H1419 stone H0068, and set it up H6965 (8686) there under an oak H0427, that [was] by the sanctuary H4720 of the LORD H3068.
024:027 And Joshua H3091 said H0559 (8799) unto all the people H5971, Behold, this stone H0068 shall be a witness H5713 unto us; for it hath heard H8085 (8804) all the words H0561 of the LORD H3068 which he spake H1696 (8765) unto us: it shall be therefore a witness H5713 unto you, lest ye deny H3584 (8762) your God H0430.
024:028 So Joshua H3091 let the people H5971 depart H7971 (8762), every man H0376 unto his inheritance H5159.
024:029 And it came to pass after H0310 these things H1697, that Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068, died H4191 (8799), [being] an hundred H3967 and ten H6235 years H8141 old H1121.
024:030 And they buried H6912 (8799) him in the border H1366 of his inheritance H5159 in Timnathserah H8556, which [is] in mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, on the north side H6828 of the hill H2022 of Gaash H1608.
024:031 And Israel H3478 served H5647 (8799) the LORD H3068 all the days H3117 of Joshua H3091, and all the days H3117 of the elders H2205 that overlived H0748 (8689) H3117 H0310 Joshua H3091, and which had known H3045 (8804) all the works H4639 of the LORD H3068, that he had done H6213 (8804) for Israel H3478.
024:032 And the bones H6106 of Joseph H3130, which the children H1121 of Israel H3478 brought up H5927 (8689) out of Egypt H4714, buried H6912 (8804) they in Shechem H7927, in a parcel H2513 of ground H7704 which Jacob H3290 bought H7069 (8804) of the sons H1121 of Hamor H2544 the father H0001 of Shechem H7927 for an hundred H3967 pieces of silver H7192: and it became the inheritance H5159 of the children H1121 of Joseph H3130.
024:033 And Eleazar H0499 the son H1121 of Aaron H0175 died H4191 (8804); and they buried H6912 (8799) him in a hill H1389 [that pertained to] Phinehas H6372 his son H1121, which was given H5414 (8738) him in mount H2022 Ephraim H0669.
