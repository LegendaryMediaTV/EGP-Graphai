001:017 So G3767 all G3956 the generations G1074 from G0575 Abraham G0011 to G2193 David G1138 [are] fourteen G1180 generations G1074; and G2532 from G0575 David G1138 until G2193 the carrying away G3350 into Babylon G0897 [are] fourteen G1180 generations G1074; and G2532 from G0575 the carrying away G3350 into Babylon G0897 unto G2193 Christ G5547 [are] fourteen G1180 generations G1074.
001:018 Now G1161 the birth G1083 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 was G2258 (ImpfInd) on this wise G3779: When as G1063 his G0846 mother G3384 Mary G3137 was espoused G3423 (AorPasPtc) to Joseph G2501, before G4250 G2228 they G0846 came together G4905 (Aor2ActInf), she was found G2147 (AorPasInd) with child G1722 G1064 G2192 (PresActPtc) of G1537 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
001:019 Then G1161 Joseph G2501 her G0846 husband G0435, being G5607 (PresPtc) a just G1342 [man], and G2532 not G3361 willing G2309 (PresActPtc) to make G3856 her G0846 a publick example G3856 (AorActInf), was minded G1014 (AorPasDepInd) to put G0630 her G0846 away G0630 (AorActInf) privily G2977.
001:020 But G1161 while he G0846 thought on G1760 (AorPasDepPtc) these things G5023, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 appeared G5316 (Aor2PasDepSubj) unto him G0846 in G2596 a dream G3677, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Joseph G2501, thou son G5207 of David G1138, fear G5399 (AorPasDepSubj) not G3361 to take G3880 (Aor2ActInf) unto thee G4675 Mary G3137 thy wife G1135: for G1063 that which is conceived G1080 (AorPasPtc) in G1722 her G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) of G1537 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
001:021 And G1161 she shall bring forth G5088 (FutMidDepInd) a son G5207, and G2532 thou shalt call G2564 (FutActInd) his G0846 name G3686 JESUS G2424: for G1063 he G0846 shall save G4982 (FutActInd) his G0846 people G2992 from G0575 their G0846 sins G0266.
001:022 Now G1161 all G3650 this G5124 was done G1096 (Perf2ActInd), that G2443 it might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) of G5259 the Lord G2962 by G1223 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
001:023 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a virgin G3933 shall be with child G1722 G1064 G2192 (FutActInd), and G2532 shall bring forth G5088 (FutMidDepInd) a son G5207, and G2532 they shall call G2564 (FutActInd) his G0846 name G3686 Emmanuel G1694, which G3739 being interpreted G3177 (PresPasPtc) is G2076 (PresInd), God G2316 with G3326 us G2257.
001:024 Then G1161 Joseph G2501 being raised G1326 (AorPasPtc) from G0575 sleep G5258 did G4160 (AorActInd) as G5613 the angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 had bidden G4367 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 took G3880 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846 his wife G1135:
001:025 And G2532 knew G1097 (ImpfActInd) her G0846 not G3756 till G2193 G3739 she had brought forth G5088 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846 firstborn G4416 son G5207: and G2532 he called G2564 (AorActInd) his G0846 name G3686 JESUS G2424.
002:001 ¶  Now G1161 when Jesus G2424 was born G1080 (AorPasPtc) in G1722 Bethlehem G0965 of Judaea G2449 in G1722 the days G2250 of Herod G2264 the king G0935, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there came G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd) wise men G3097 from G0575 the east G0395 to G1519 Jerusalem G2414,
002:002 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Where G4226 is G2076 (PresInd) he that is born G5088 (AorPasPtc) King G0935 of the Jews G2453? for G1063 we have seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 star G0792 in G1722 the east G0395, and G2532 are come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to worship G4352 (AorActInf) him G0846.
002:003 When G1161 Herod G2264 the king G0935 had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [these things], he was troubled G5015 (AorPasInd), and G2532 all G3956 Jerusalem G2414 with G3326 him G0846.
002:004 And G2532 when he had gathered G4863 all G3956 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 scribes G1122 of the people G2992 together G4863 (Aor2ActPtc), he demanded G4441 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) of G3844 them G0846 where G4226 Christ G5547 should be born G1080 (PresPasInd).
002:005 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, In G1722 Bethlehem G0965 of Judaea G2449: for G1063 thus G3779 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) by G1223 the prophet G4396,
002:006 And G2532 thou G4771 Bethlehem G0965, [in] the land G1093 of Juda G2448, art G1488 (PresInd) not G3760 the least G1646 among G1722 the princes G2232 of Juda G2448: for G1063 out of G1537 thee G4675 shall come G1831 (FutMidDepInd) a Governor G2233 (PresMidPasDepPtc), that G3748 shall rule G4165 (FutActInd) my G3450 people G2992 Israel G2474.
002:007 Then G5119 Herod G2264, when he had privily G2977 called G2564 (AorActPtc) the wise men G3097, enquired G0198 of G3844 them G0846 diligently G0198 (AorActInd) what time G5550 the star G0792 appeared G5316 (PresMidPasPtc).
002:008 And G2532 he sent G3992 (AorActPtc) them G0846 to G1519 Bethlehem G0965, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Go G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) and search G1833 (AorActImpr) diligently G0199 for G4012 the young child G3813; and G1161 when G1875 ye have found G2147 (Aor2ActSubj) [him], bring G0518 me G3427 word again G0518 (AorActImpr), that G3704 I may come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and worship G4352 (AorActSubj) him G0846 also G2504.
002:009 When G1161 they had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) the king G0935, they departed G4198 (AorPasDepInd); and G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the star G0792, which G3739 they saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the east G0395, went before G4254 (ImpfActInd) them G0846, till G2193 it came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) over G1883 where G3757 the young child G3813 was G2258 (ImpfInd).
002:010 When G1161 they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the star G0792, they rejoiced G5463 (Aor2PasDepInd) with exceeding G4970 great G3173 joy G5479.
002:011 And G2532 when they were come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the house G3614, they saw G2147 (Aor2ActInd) G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the young child G3813 with G3326 Mary G3137 his G0846 mother G3384, and G2532 fell down G4098 (Aor2ActPtc), and worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) him G0846: and G2532 when they had opened G0455 (AorActPtc) their G0846 treasures G2344, they presented G4374 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 gifts G1435; gold G5557, and G2532 frankincense G3030, and G2532 myrrh G4666.
002:012 And G2532 being warned of God G5537 (AorPasPtc) in G2596 a dream G3677 that they should G0344 not G3361 return G0344 (AorActInf) to G4314 Herod G2264, they departed G0402 (AorActInd) into G1519 their own G0846 country G5561 another G1223 G0243 way G3598.
002:013 And G1161 when they G0846 were departed G0402 (AorActPtc), behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 appeareth G5316 (PresMidPasInd) to Joseph G2501 in G2596 a dream G3677, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Arise G1453 (AorPasPtc), and take G3880 (Aor2ActImpr) the young child G3813 and G2532 his G0846 mother G3384, and G2532 flee G5343 (PresActImpr) into G1519 Egypt G0125, and G2532 be thou G2468 (PresImpr) there G1563 until G2193 I G0302 bring G2036 thee G4671 word G2036 (Aor2ActSubj): for G1063 Herod G2264 will G3195 (PresActInd) seek G2212 (PresActInf) the young child G3813 to destroy G0622 (AorActInf) him G0846.
002:014 When G1161 he arose G1453 (AorPasPtc), he took G3880 (Aor2ActInd) the young child G3813 and G2532 his G0846 mother G3384 by night G3571, and G2532 departed G0402 (AorActInd) into G1519 Egypt G0125:
002:015 And G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563 until G2193 the death G5054 of Herod G2264: that G2443 it might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) of G5259 the Lord G2962 by G1223 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Out of G1537 Egypt G0125 have I called G2564 (AorActInd) my G3450 son G5207.
002:016 Then G5119 Herod G2264, when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he was mocked G1702 (AorPasInd) of G5259 the wise men G3097, was exceeding G3029 wroth G2373 (AorPasInd), and G2532 sent forth G0649 (AorActPtc), and slew G0337 (Aor2ActInd) all G3956 the children G3816 that were in G1722 Bethlehem G0965, and G2532 in G1722 all G3956 the coasts G3725 thereof G0846, from G0575 two years old G1332 and G2532 under G2736, according G2596 to the time G5550 which G3739 he had diligently enquired G0198 (AorActInd) of G3844 the wise men G3097.
002:017 Then G5119 was fulfilled G4137 (AorPasInd) that which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G5259 Jeremy G2408 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
002:018 In G1722 Rama G4471 was there G0191 a voice G5456 heard G0191 (AorPasInd), lamentation G2355, and G2532 weeping G2805, and G2532 great G4183 mourning G3602, Rachel G4478 weeping G2799 (PresActPtc) [for] her G0846 children G5043, and G2532 would G2309 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 be comforted G3870 (AorPasInf), because G3754 they are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756.
002:019 But G1161 when Herod G2264 was dead G5053 (AorActPtc), behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), an angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 appeareth G5316 (PresMidPasInd) in G2596 a dream G3677 to Joseph G2501 in G1722 Egypt G0125,
002:020 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Arise G1453 (AorPasPtc), and take G3880 (Aor2ActImpr) the young child G3813 and G2532 his G0846 mother G3384, and G2532 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) into G1519 the land G1093 of Israel G2474: for G1063 they are dead G2348 (PerfActInd) which G3588 sought G2212 (PresActPtc) the young child’s G3813 life G5590.
002:021 And G1161 he arose G1453 (AorPasPtc), and took G3880 (Aor2ActInd) the young child G3813 and G2532 his G0846 mother G3384, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the land G1093 of Israel G2474.
002:022 But G1161 when he heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 Archelaus G0745 did reign G0936 (PresActInd) in G1909 Judaea G2449 in the room G0473 of his G0846 father G3962 Herod G2264, he was afraid G5399 (AorPasDepInd) to go G0565 (Aor2ActInf) thither G1563: notwithstanding G1161, being warned of God G5537 (AorPasPtc) in G2596 a dream G3677, he turned aside G0402 (AorActInd) into G1519 the parts G3313 of Galilee G1056:
002:023 And G2532 he came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and dwelt G2730 (AorActInd) in G1519 a city G4172 called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Nazareth G3478: that G3704 it might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G1223 the prophets G4396, G3754 He shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) a Nazarene G3480.
003:001 ¶  G1161 In G1722 those G1565 days G2250 came G3854 (PresMidPasDepInd) John G2491 the Baptist G0910, preaching G2784 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the wilderness G2048 of Judaea G2449,
003:002 And G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Repent ye G3340 (PresActImpr): for G1063 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is at hand G1448 (PerfActInd).
003:003 For G1063 this G3778 is he G2076 (PresInd) that was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) of by G5259 the prophet G4396 Esaias G2268, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), The voice G5456 of one crying G0994 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the wilderness G2048, Prepare ye G2090 (AorActImpr) the way G3598 of the Lord G2962, make G4160 (PresActImpr) his G0846 paths G5147 straight G2117.
003:004 And G1161 the same G0846 John G2491 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 raiment G1742 of G0575 camel’s G2574 hair G2359, and G2532 a leathern G1193 girdle G2223 about G4012 his G0846 loins G3751; and G1161 his G0846 meat G5160 was G2258 (ImpfInd) locusts G0200 and G2532 wild G0066 honey G3192.
003:005 Then G5119 went out G1607 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to G4314 him G0846 Jerusalem G2414, and G2532 all G3956 Judaea G2449, and G2532 all G3956 the region round about G4066 Jordan G2446,
003:006 And G2532 were baptized G0907 (ImpfPasInd) of G5259 him G0846 in G1722 Jordan G2446, confessing G1843 (PresMidPtc) their G0846 sins G0266.
003:007 But G1161 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) many G4183 of the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 Sadducees G4523 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G1909 his G0846 baptism G0908, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, O generation G1081 of vipers G2191, who G5101 hath warned G5263 (AorActInd) you G5213 to flee G5343 (Aor2ActInf) from G0575 the wrath G3709 to come G3195 (PresActPtc)?
003:008 Bring forth G4160 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767 fruits G2590 meet G0514 for repentance G3341:
003:009 And G2532 think G1380 (AorActSubj) not G3361 to say G3004 (PresActInf) within G1722 yourselves G1438, We have G2192 (PresActInd) Abraham G0011 to [our] father G3962: for G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 God G2316 is able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) of G1537 these G5130 stones G3037 to raise up G1453 (AorActInf) children G5043 unto Abraham G0011.
003:010 And G1161 now G2235 also G2532 the axe G0513 is laid G2749 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 the root G4491 of the trees G1186: therefore G3767 every G3956 tree G1186 which bringeth G4160 not G3361 forth G4160 (PresActPtc) good G2570 fruit G2590 is hewn down G1581 (PresPasInd), and G2532 cast G0906 (PresPasInd) into G1519 the fire G4442.
003:011 I G1473 indeed G3303 baptize G0907 (PresActInd) you G5209 with G1722 water G5204 unto G1519 repentance G3341: but G1161 he that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) after G3694 me G3450 is G2076 (PresInd) mightier than G2478 I G3450, whose G3739 shoes G5266 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G2425 to bear G0941 (AorActInf): he G0846 shall baptize G0907 (FutActInd) you G5209 with G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, and G2532 [with] fire G4442:
003:012 Whose G3739 fan G4425 [is] in G1722 his G0846 hand G5495, and G2532 he will throughly purge G1245 (FutActInd) his G0846 floor G0257, and G2532 gather G4863 (FutActInd) his G0846 wheat G4621 into G1519 the garner G0596; but G1161 he will burn up G2618 (FutActInd) the chaff G0892 with unquenchable G0762 fire G4442.
003:013 Then G5119 cometh G3854 (PresMidPasDepInd) Jesus G2424 from G0575 Galilee G1056 to G1909 Jordan G2446 unto G4314 John G2491, to be baptized G0907 (AorPasInf) of G5259 him G0846.
003:014 But G1161 John G2491 forbad G1254 (ImpfActInd) him, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I G1473 have G2192 (PresActInd) need G5532 to be baptized G0907 (AorPasInf) of G5259 thee G4675, and G2532 comest G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) thou G4771 to G4314 me G3165?
003:015 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Suffer G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) [it to be so] now G0737: for G1063 thus G3779 it becometh G4241 (PresActPtc) G2076 (PresInd) us G2254 to fulfil G4137 (AorActInf) all G3956 righteousness G1343. Then G5119 he suffered G0863 (PresActInd) him G0846.
003:016 And G2532 Jesus G2424, when he was baptized G0907 (AorPasPtc), went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) straightway G2117 out of G0575 the water G5204: and G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the heavens G3772 were opened G0455 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846, and G2532 he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the Spirit G4151 of God G2316 descending G2597 (PresActPtc) like G5616 a dove G4058, and G2532 lighting G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 him G0846:
003:017 And G2532 lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a voice G5456 from G1537 heaven G3772, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 beloved G0027 Son G5207, in G1722 whom G3739 I am well pleased G2106 (AorActInd).
004:001 ¶  Then G5119 was Jesus G2424 led up G0321 (AorPasInd) of G5259 the Spirit G4151 into G1519 the wilderness G2048 to be tempted G3985 (AorPasInf) of G5259 the devil G1228.
004:002 And G2532 when he had fasted G3522 (AorActPtc) forty G5062 days G2250 and G2532 forty G5062 nights G3571, he was afterward G5305 an hungred G3983 (AorActInd).
004:003 And G2532 when the tempter G3985 (PresActPtc) came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) to him G0846, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), If G1487 thou be G1488 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316, command G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) that G2443 these G3778 stones G3037 be made G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) bread G0740.
004:004 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), It is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), Man G0444 shall G2198 not G3756 live G2198 (FutMidDepInd) by G1909 bread G0740 alone G3441, but G0235 by G1909 every G3956 word G4487 that proceedeth G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1223 the mouth G4750 of God G2316.
004:005 Then G5119 the devil G1228 taketh G3880 him G0846 up G3880 (PresActInd) into G1519 the holy G0040 city G4172, and G2532 setteth G2476 (PresActInd) him G0846 on G1909 a pinnacle G4419 of the temple G2411,
004:006 And G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, If G1487 thou be G1488 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316, cast G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) thyself G4572 down G2736: for G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), G3754 He shall give G1781 his G0846 angels G0032 charge G1781 (FutMidPasDepInd) concerning G4012 thee G4675: and G2532 in G1909 [their] hands G5495 they shall bear G0142 thee G4571 up G0142 (FutActInd), lest at any time G3379 thou dash G4350 (AorActSubj) thy G4675 foot G4228 against G4314 a stone G3037.
004:007 Jesus G2424 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto him G0846, It is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) again G3825, Thou shalt G1598 not G3756 tempt G1598 (FutActInd) the Lord G2962 thy G4675 God G2316.
004:008 Again G3825, the devil G1228 taketh G3880 him G0846 up G3880 (PresActInd) into G1519 an exceeding G3029 high G5308 mountain G3735, and G2532 sheweth G1166 (PresActInd) him G0846 all G3956 the kingdoms G0932 of the world G2889, and G2532 the glory G1391 of them G0846;
004:009 And G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, All G3956 these things G5023 will I give G1325 (FutActInd) thee G4671, if G1437 thou wilt fall down G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) and worship G4352 (AorActSubj) me G3427.
004:010 Then G5119 saith G3004 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 unto him G0846, Get thee hence G5217 (PresActImpr), Satan G4567: for G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), Thou shalt worship G4352 (FutActInd) the Lord G2962 thy G4675 God G2316, and G2532 him G0846 only G3441 shalt thou serve G3000 (FutActInd).
004:011 Then G5119 the devil G1228 leaveth G0863 (PresActInd) him G0846, and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), angels G0032 came G4334 (AorActInd) and G2532 ministered G1247 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846.
004:012 Now G1161 when Jesus G2424 had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 John G2491 was cast into prison G3860 (AorPasInd), he departed G0402 (AorActInd) into G1519 Galilee G1056;
004:013 And G2532 leaving G2641 (Aor2ActPtc) Nazareth G3478, he came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and dwelt G2730 (AorActInd) in G1519 Capernaum G2584, which G3588 is upon the sea coast G3864, in G1722 the borders G3725 of Zabulon G2194 and G2532 Nephthalim G3508:
004:014 That G2443 it might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G1223 Esaias G2268 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
004:015 The land G1093 of Zabulon G2194, and G2532 the land G1093 of Nephthalim G3508, [by] the way G3598 of the sea G2281, beyond G4008 Jordan G2446, Galilee G1056 of the Gentiles G1484;
004:016 The people G2992 which G3588 sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 darkness G4655 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) great G3173 light G5457; and G2532 to them which G3588 sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the region G5561 and G2532 shadow G4639 of death G2288 light G5457 is sprung up G0393 (AorActInd) G0846.
004:017 From G0575 that time G5119 Jesus G2424 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to preach G2784 (PresActInf), and G2532 to say G3004 (PresActInf), Repent G3340 (PresActImpr): for G1063 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is at hand G1448 (PerfActInd).
004:018 And G1161 Jesus G2424, walking G4043 (PresActPtc) by G3844 the sea G2281 of Galilee G1056, saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) two G1417 brethren G0080, Simon G4613 called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Peter G4074, and G2532 Andrew G0406 his G0846 brother G0080, casting G0906 (PresActPtc) a net G0293 into G1519 the sea G2281: for G1063 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) fishers G0231.
004:019 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Follow G1205 (Impr) G3694 me G3450, and G2532 I will make G4160 (FutActInd) you G5209 fishers G0231 of men G0444.
004:020 And G1161 they straightway G2112 left G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) [their] nets G1350, and followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
004:021 And G2532 going on G4260 (Aor2ActPtc) from thence G1564, he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) other G0243 two G1417 brethren G0080, James G2385 [the son] of G3588 Zebedee G2199, and G2532 John G2491 his G0846 brother G0080, in G1722 a ship G4143 with G3326 Zebedee G2199 their G0846 father G3962, mending G2675 (PresActPtc) their G0846 nets G1350; and G2532 he called G2564 (AorActInd) them G0846.
004:022 And G1161 they immediately G2112 left G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) the ship G4143 and G2532 their G0846 father G3962, and followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
004:023 And G2532 Jesus G2424 went about G4013 (ImpfActInd) all G3650 Galilee G1056, teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) in G1722 their G0846 synagogues G4864, and G2532 preaching G2784 (PresActPtc) the gospel G2098 of the kingdom G0932, and G2532 healing G2323 (PresActPtc) all G3956 manner of sickness G3554 and G2532 all G3956 manner of disease G3119 among G1722 the people G2992.
004:024 And G2532 his G0846 fame G0189 went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) throughout G1519 all G3650 Syria G4947: and G2532 they brought G4374 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 all G3956 sick G2560 people G2192 (PresActPtc) that were taken with G4912 (PresPasPtc) divers G4164 diseases G3554 and G2532 torments G0931, and G2532 those which were possessed with devils G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 those which were lunatick G4583 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 those that had the palsy G3885; and G2532 he healed G2323 (AorActInd) them G0846.
004:025 And G2532 there followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846 great G4183 multitudes of people G3793 from G0575 Galilee G1056, and G2532 [from] Decapolis G1179, and G2532 [from] Jerusalem G2414, and G2532 [from] Judaea G2449, and G2532 [from] beyond G4008 Jordan G2446.
005:001 ¶  And G1161 seeing G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the multitudes G3793, he went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a mountain G3735: and G2532 when he G0846 was set G2523 (AorActPtc), his G0846 disciples G3101 came G4334 (AorActInd) unto him G0846:
005:002 And G2532 he opened G0455 (AorActPtc) his G0846 mouth G4750, and taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
005:003 Blessed G3107 [are] the poor G4434 in spirit G4151: for G3754 theirs G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772.
005:004 Blessed G3107 [are] they that mourn G3996 (PresActPtc): for G3754 they G0846 shall be comforted G3870 (FutPasInd).
005:005 Blessed G3107 [are] the meek G4239: for G3754 they G0846 shall inherit G2816 (FutActInd) the earth G1093.
005:006 Blessed G3107 [are] they which G3588 do hunger G3983 (PresActPtc) and G2532 thirst G1372 (PresActPtc) after righteousness G1343: for G3754 they G0846 shall be filled G5526 (FutPasInd).
005:007 Blessed G3107 [are] the merciful G1655: for G3754 they G0846 shall obtain mercy G1653 (FutPasInd).
005:008 Blessed G3107 [are] the pure G2513 in heart G2588: for G3754 they G0846 shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) God G2316.
005:009 Blessed G3107 [are] the peacemakers G1518: for G3754 they G0846 shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) the children G5207 of God G2316.
005:010 Blessed G3107 [are] they which are persecuted G1377 (PerfPasPtc) for G1752 righteousness’ sake G1343: for G3754 theirs G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772.
005:011 Blessed G3107 are ye G2075 (PresInd), when G3752 [men] shall revile G3679 (AorActSubj) you G5209, and G2532 persecute G1377 (AorActSubj) [you], and G2532 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) all manner G3956 of evil G4190 G4487 against G2596 you G5216 falsely G5574 (PresMidPasPtc), for my sake G1752 G1700.
005:012 Rejoice G5463 (PresActImpr), and G2532 be exceeding glad G0021 (PresMidPasDepImpr): for G3754 great G4183 [is] your G5216 reward G3408 in G1722 heaven G3772: for G1063 so G3779 persecuted they G1377 (AorActInd) the prophets G4396 which G3588 were before G4253 you G5216.
005:013 Ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) the salt G0217 of the earth G1093: but G1161 if G1437 the salt G0217 have lost his savour G3471 (AorPasSubj), wherewith G1722 G5101 shall it be salted G0233 (FutPasInd)? it is thenceforth G2089 good G2480 (PresActInd) for G1519 nothing G3762, but G1508 to be cast G0906 (AorPasInf) out G1854, and G2532 to be trodden under foot G2662 (PresPasInf) of G5259 men G0444.
005:014 Ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) the light G5457 of the world G2889. A city G4172 that is set G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1883 an hill G3735 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be hid G2928 (Aor2PasInf).
005:015 Neither G3761 do men light G2545 (PresActInd) a candle G3088, and G2532 put G5087 (PresActInd) it G0846 under G5259 a bushel G3426, but G0235 on G1909 a candlestick G3087; and G2532 it giveth light G2989 (PresActInd) unto all G3956 that are in G1722 the house G3614.
005:016 Let your G5216 light G5457 so G3779 shine G2989 (AorActImpr) before G1715 men G0444, that G3704 they may see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) your G5216 good G2570 works G2041, and G2532 glorify G1392 (AorActSubj) your G5216 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772.
005:017 Think G3543 (AorActSubj) not G3361 that G3754 I am come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to destroy G2647 (AorActInf) the law G3551, or G2228 the prophets G4396: I am G2064 not G3756 come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to destroy G2647 (AorActInf), but G0235 to fulfil G4137 (AorActInf).
005:018 For G1063 verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Till G2193 G0302 heaven G3772 and G2532 earth G1093 pass G3928 (Aor2ActSubj), one G1520 jot G2503 or G2228 one G3391 tittle G2762 shall in no wise G3364 pass G3928 (Aor2ActSubj) from G0575 the law G3551, till G2193 G0302 all G3956 be fulfilled G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj).
005:019 Whosoever G3739 G1437 therefore G3767 shall break G3089 (AorActSubj) one G3391 of these G5130 least G1646 commandments G1785, and G2532 shall teach G1321 (AorActSubj) men G0444 so G3779, he shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) the least G1646 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772: but G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall do G4160 (AorActSubj) and G2532 teach G1321 (AorActSubj) [them], the same G3778 shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) great G3173 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772.
005:020 For G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 except G3362 your G5216 righteousness G1343 shall exceed G4052 (AorActSubj) G4119 [the righteousness] of the scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, ye shall in no case G3364 enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772.
005:021 Ye have heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G3754 it was said G4483 (AorPasInd) by them of old time G0744, Thou shalt G5407 not G3756 kill G5407 (FutActInd); and G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall kill G5407 (AorActSubj) shall be G2071 (FutInd) in danger G1777 of the judgment G2920:
005:022 But G1161 I G1473 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 whosoever G3956 is angry G3710 (PresPasPtc) with his G0846 brother G0080 without a cause G1500 shall be G2071 (FutInd) in danger G1777 of the judgment G2920: and G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) to his G0846 brother G0080, Raca G4469, shall be G2071 (FutInd) in danger G1777 of the council G4892: but G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), Thou fool G3474, shall be G2071 (FutInd) in danger G1777 of G1519 hell G1067 fire G4442.
005:023 Therefore G3767 if G1437 thou bring G4374 (PresActSubj) thy G4675 gift G1435 to G1909 the altar G2379, and there G2546 rememberest G3415 (AorPasSubj) that G3754 thy G4675 brother G0080 hath G2192 (PresActInd) ought G5100 against G2596 thee G4675;
005:024 Leave G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) there G1563 thy G4675 gift G1435 before G1715 the altar G2379, and G2532 go thy way G5217 (PresActImpr); first G4412 be reconciled G1259 (Aor2PasImpr) to thy G4675 brother G0080, and G2532 then G5119 come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and offer G4374 (PresActImpr) thy G4675 gift G1435.
005:025 Agree G2468 (PresImpr) G2132 (PresActPtc) with thine G4675 adversary G0476 quickly G5035, whiles G2193 G3755 thou art G1488 (PresInd) in G1722 the way G3598 with G3326 him G0846; lest at any time G3379 the adversary G0476 deliver G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) thee G4571 to the judge G2923, and G2532 the judge G2923 deliver G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) thee G4571 to the officer G5257, and G2532 thou be cast G0906 (FutPasInd) into G1519 prison G5438.
005:026 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, Thou shalt G1831 by no means G3364 come G1831 (Aor2ActSubj) out thence G1564, till G2193 G0302 thou hast paid G0591 (Aor2ActSubj) the uttermost G2078 farthing G2835.
005:027 Ye have heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G3754 it was said G4483 (AorPasInd) by them of old time G0744, Thou shalt G3431 not G3756 commit adultery G3431 (FutActInd):
005:028 But G1161 I G1473 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 whosoever G3956 looketh G0991 (PresActPtc) on a woman G1135 to G4314 lust after G1937 (AorActInf) her G0846 hath committed adultery G3431 (AorActInd) with her G0846 already G2235 in G1722 his G0846 heart G2588.
005:029 And G1161 if G1487 thy G4675 right G1188 eye G3788 offend G4624 (PresActInd) thee G4571, pluck G1807 it G0846 out G1807 (Aor2ActImpr), and G2532 cast G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) [it] from G0575 thee G4675: for G1063 it is profitable G4851 (PresActInd) for thee G4671 that G2443 one G1520 of thy G4675 members G3196 should perish G0622 (Aor2MidSubj), and G2532 not G3361 [that] thy G4675 whole G3650 body G4983 should be cast G0906 (AorPasSubj) into G1519 hell G1067.
005:030 And G2532 if G1487 thy G4675 right G1188 hand G5495 offend G4624 (PresActInd) thee G4571, cut G1581 it G0846 off G1581 (AorActImpr), and G2532 cast G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) [it] from G0575 thee G4675: for G1063 it is profitable G4851 (PresActInd) for thee G4671 that G2443 one G1520 of thy G4675 members G3196 should perish G0622 (Aor2MidSubj), and G2532 not G3361 [that] thy G4675 whole G3650 body G4983 should be cast G0906 (AorPasSubj) into G1519 hell G1067.
005:031 G1161 It hath been said G4483 (AorPasInd) G3754, Whosoever G3739 G0302 shall put away G0630 (AorActSubj) his G0846 wife G1135, let him give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) her G0846 a writing of divorcement G0647:
005:032 But G1161 I G1473 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall put away G0630 (AorActSubj) his G0846 wife G1135, saving G3924 for the cause G3056 of fornication G4202, causeth G4160 (PresActInd) her G0846 to commit adultery G3429 (PresMidPasDepInf): and G2532 whosoever G3739 G1437 shall marry G1060 (AorActSubj) her that is divorced G0630 (PerfPasPtc) committeth adultery G3429 (PresMidPasDepInd).
005:033 Again G3825, ye have heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G3754 it hath been said G4483 (AorPasInd) by them of old time G0744, Thou shalt G1964 not G3756 forswear thyself G1964 (FutActInd), but G1161 shalt perform G0591 (FutActInd) unto the Lord G2962 thine G4675 oaths G3727:
005:034 But G1161 I G1473 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Swear G3660 (AorActInf) not G3361 at all G3654; neither G3383 by G1722 heaven G3772; for G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) God’s G2316 throne G2362:
005:035 Nor G3383 by G1722 the earth G1093; for G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) his G0846 footstool G4228 G5286: neither G3383 by G1519 Jerusalem G2414; for G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) the city G4172 of the great G3173 King G0935.
005:036 Neither G3383 shalt thou swear G3660 (AorActSubj) by G1722 thy G4675 head G2776, because G3754 thou canst G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 make G4160 (AorActInf) one G3391 hair G2359 white G3022 or G2228 black G3189.
005:037 But G1161 let G2077 your G5216 communication G3056 be G2077 (PresImpr), Yea G3483, yea G3483; Nay G3756, nay G3756: for G1161 whatsoever is more G4053 than these G5130 cometh G2076 (PresInd) of G1537 evil G4190.
005:038 Ye have heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G3754 it hath been said G4483 (AorPasInd), An eye G3788 for G0473 an eye G3788, and G2532 a tooth G3599 for G0473 a tooth G3599:
005:039 But G1161 I G1473 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That ye resist G0436 (Aor2ActInf) not G3361 evil G4190: but G0235 whosoever G3748 shall smite G4474 (FutActInd) thee G4571 on G1909 thy G4675 right G1188 cheek G4600, turn G4762 (AorActImpr) to him G0846 the other G0243 also G2532.
005:040 And G2532 if any man will G2309 (PresActPtc) sue G2919 thee G4671 at the law G2919 (AorPasInf), and G2532 take away G2983 (Aor2ActInf) thy G4675 coat G5509, let G0863 him G0846 have G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) [thy] cloke G2440 also G2532.
005:041 And G2532 whosoever G3748 shall compel G0029 thee G4571 to go G0029 (FutActInd) a G1520 mile G3400, go G5217 (PresActImpr) with G3326 him G0846 twain G1417.
005:042 Give G1325 (PresActImpr) to him that asketh G0154 (PresActPtc) thee G4571, and G2532 from him that would G2309 (PresActPtc) borrow G1155 (AorMidInf) of G0575 thee G4675 turn G0654 not G3361 thou away G0654 (Aor2PasSubj).
005:043 Ye have heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G3754 it hath been said G4483 (AorPasInd), Thou shalt love G0025 (FutActInd) thy G4675 neighbour G4139, and G2532 hate G3404 (FutActInd) thine G4675 enemy G2190.
005:044 But G1161 I G1473 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Love G0025 (PresActImpr) your G5216 enemies G2190, bless G2127 (PresActImpr) them that curse G2672 (PresMidPasDepPtc) you G5209, do G4160 (PresActImpr) good G2573 to them that hate G3404 (PresActPtc) you G5209, and G2532 pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr) for G5228 them which G3588 despitefully use G1908 (PresActPtc) you G5209, and G2532 persecute G1377 (PresActPtc) you G5209;
005:045 That G3704 ye may be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) the children G5207 of your G5216 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772: for G3754 he maketh G0393 his G0846 sun G2246 to rise G0393 (PresActInd) on G1909 the evil G4190 and G2532 on the good G0018, and G2532 sendeth rain G1026 (PresActInd) on G1909 the just G1342 and G2532 on the unjust G0094.
005:046 For G1063 if G1437 ye love G0025 (AorActSubj) them which G3588 love G0025 (PresActPtc) you G5209, what G5101 reward G3408 have ye G2192 (PresActInd)? do G4160 (PresActInd) not G3780 even G2532 the publicans G5057 the same G0846?
005:047 And G2532 if G1437 ye salute G0782 (AorMidDepSubj) your G5216 brethren G0080 only G3440, what G5101 do G4160 (PresActInd) ye more G4053 [than others]? do G4160 (PresActInd) not G3780 even G2532 the publicans G5057 so G3779?
005:048 Be G2071 (FutInd) ye G5210 therefore G3767 perfect G5046, even G5618 as your G5216 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) perfect G5046.
006:001 ¶  Take heed G4337 (PresActImpr) that ye do G4160 (PresActInf) not G3361 your G5216 alms G1654 before G1715 men G0444, to be seen G4314 G2300 (AorPasInf) of them G0846: otherwise G1490 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 reward G3408 of G3844 your G5216 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772.
006:002 Therefore G3767 when G3752 thou doest G4160 (PresActSubj) [thine] alms G1654, do G4537 not G3361 sound a trumpet G4537 (AorActSubj) before G1715 thee G4675, as G5618 the hypocrites G5273 do G4160 (PresActInd) in G1722 the synagogues G4864 and G2532 in G1722 the streets G4505, that G3704 they may have glory G1392 (AorPasSubj) of G5259 men G0444. Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, They have G0568 (PresActInd) their G0846 reward G3408.
006:003 But G1161 when thou G4675 doest G4160 (PresActPtc) alms G1654, let G1097 not G3361 thy G4675 left hand G0710 know G1097 (Aor2ActImpr) what G5101 thy G4675 right hand G1188 doeth G4160 (PresActInd):
006:004 That G3704 thine G4675 alms G1654 may be G5600 (PresSubj) in G1722 secret G2927: and G2532 thy G4675 Father G3962 which G3588 seeth G0991 (PresActPtc) in G1722 secret G2927 himself G0846 shall reward G0591 (FutActInd) thee G4671 openly G1722 G5318.
006:005 And G2532 when G3752 thou prayest G4336 (PresMidPasDepSubj), thou shalt G2071 not G3756 be G2071 (FutInd) as G5618 the hypocrites G5273 [are]: for G3754 they love G5368 (PresActInd) to pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepInf) standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 the synagogues G4864 and G2532 in G1722 the corners G1137 of the streets G4113, that G3704 they may G0302 be seen G5316 (Aor2PasSubj) of men G0444. Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 They have G0568 (PresActInd) their G0846 reward G3408.
006:006 But G1161 thou G4771, when G3752 thou prayest G4336 (PresMidPasDepSubj), enter G1525 (Aor2ActImpr) into G1519 thy G4675 closet G5009, and G2532 when thou hast shut G2808 (AorActPtc) thy G4675 door G2374, pray G4336 (AorMidDepImpr) to thy G4675 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 secret G2927; and G2532 thy G4675 Father G3962 which G3588 seeth G0991 (PresActPtc) in G1722 secret G2927 shall reward G0591 (FutActInd) thee G4671 openly G1722 G5318.
006:007 But G1161 when ye pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc), use G0945 not G3361 vain repetitions G0945 (AorActSubj), as G5618 the heathen G1482 [do]: for G1063 they think G1380 (PresActInd) that G3754 they shall be heard G1522 (FutPasInd) for G1722 their G0846 much speaking G4180.
006:008 Be G3666 not G3361 ye G3666 therefore G3767 like G3666 (AorPasSubj) unto them G0846: for G1063 your G5216 Father G3962 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) what things G3739 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) need of G5532, before G4253 ye G5209 ask G0154 (AorActInf) him G0846.
006:009 After this manner G3779 therefore G3767 pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr) ye G5210: Our G2257 Father G3962 which G3588 art in G1722 heaven G3772, Hallowed be G0037 (AorPasImpr) thy G4675 name G3686.
006:010 Thy G4675 kingdom G0932 come G2064 (Aor2ActImpr). Thy G4675 will G2307 be done G1096 (AorPasDepImpr) in G1909 earth G1093, as G2532 G5613 [it is] in G1722 heaven G3772.
006:011 Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254 this day G4594 our G2257 daily G1967 bread G0740.
006:012 And G2532 forgive G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254 our G2257 debts G3783, as G2532 G5613 we G2249 forgive G0863 (PresActInd) our G2257 debtors G3781.
006:013 And G2532 lead G1533 (AorActSubj) us G2248 not G3361 into G1519 temptation G3986, but G0235 deliver G4506 (AorMidDepImpr) us G2248 from G0575 evil G4190: For G3754 thine G4675 is G2076 (PresInd) the kingdom G0932, and G2532 the power G1411, and G2532 the glory G1391, for G1519 ever G0165. Amen G0281.
006:014 For G1063 if G1437 ye forgive G0863 (Aor2ActSubj) men G0444 their G0846 trespasses G3900, your G5216 heavenly G3770 Father G3962 will also G2532 forgive G0863 (FutActInd) you G5213:
006:015 But G1161 if G3362 ye forgive G0863 (Aor2ActSubj) not G3362 men G0444 their G0846 trespasses G3900, neither G3761 will your G5216 Father G3962 forgive G0863 (FutActInd) your G5216 trespasses G3900.
006:016 Moreover G1161 when G3752 ye fast G3522 (PresActSubj), be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361, as G5618 the hypocrites G5273, of a sad countenance G4659: for G1063 they disfigure G0853 (PresActInd) their G0846 faces G4383, that G3704 they may appear G5316 (Aor2PasSubj) unto men G0444 to fast G3522 (PresActPtc). Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 They have G0568 (PresActInd) their G0846 reward G3408.
006:017 But G1161 thou G4771, when thou fastest G3522 (PresActPtc), anoint G0218 (AorMidImpr) thine G4675 head G2776, and G2532 wash G3538 (AorMidImpr) thy G4675 face G4383;
006:018 That G3704 thou appear G5316 (Aor2PasSubj) not G3361 unto men G0444 to fast G3522 (PresActPtc), but G0235 unto thy G4675 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 secret G2927: and G2532 thy G4675 Father G3962, which G3588 seeth G0991 (PresActPtc) in G1722 secret G2927, shall reward G0591 (FutActInd) thee G4671 openly G1722 G5318.
006:019 Lay G2343 not G3361 up G2343 (PresActImpr) for yourselves G5213 treasures G2344 upon G1909 earth G1093, where G3699 moth G4597 and G2532 rust G1035 doth corrupt G0853 (PresActInd), and G2532 where G3699 thieves G2812 break through G1358 (PresActInd) and G2532 steal G2813 (PresActInd):
006:020 But G1161 lay up G2343 (PresActImpr) for yourselves G5213 treasures G2344 in G1722 heaven G3772, where G3699 neither G3777 moth G4597 nor G3777 rust G1035 doth corrupt G0853 (PresActInd), and G2532 where G3699 thieves G2812 do G1358 not G3756 break through G1358 (PresActInd) nor G3761 steal G2813 (PresActInd):
006:021 For G1063 where G3699 your G5216 treasure G2344 is G2076 (PresInd), there G1563 will G2071 your G5216 heart G2588 be G2071 (FutInd) also G2532.
006:022 The light G3088 of the body G4983 is G2076 (PresInd) the eye G3788: if G1437 therefore G3767 thine G4675 eye G3788 be G5600 (PresSubj) single G0573, thy G4675 whole G3650 body G4983 shall be G2071 (FutInd) full of light G5460.
006:023 But G1161 if G1437 thine G4675 eye G3788 be G5600 (PresSubj) evil G4190, thy G4675 whole G3650 body G4983 shall be G2071 (FutInd) full of darkness G4652. If G1487 therefore G3767 the light G5457 that is G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 thee G4671 be darkness G4655, how great G4214 [is] that darkness G4655!
006:024 No man G3762 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) serve G1398 (PresActInf) two G1417 masters G2962: for G1063 either G2228 he will hate G3404 (FutActInd) the one G1520, and G2532 love G0025 (FutActInd) the other G2087; or else G2228 he will hold G0472 (FutMidDepInd) to the one G1520, and G2532 despise G2706 (FutActInd) the other G2087. Ye cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) serve G1398 (PresActInf) God G2316 and G2532 mammon G3126.
006:025 Therefore G1223 G5124 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Take no G3361 thought G3309 (PresActImpr) for your G5216 life G5590, what G5101 ye shall eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj), or G2532 what G5101 ye shall drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj); nor yet for G3366 your G5216 body G4983, what G5101 ye shall put on G1746 (AorMidSubj). Is G2076 (PresInd) not G3780 the life G5590 more than G4119 meat G5160, and G2532 the body G4983 than raiment G1742?
006:026 Behold G1689 (AorActImpr) G1519 the fowls G4071 of the air G3772: for G3754 they sow G4687 (PresActInd) not G3756, neither G3761 do they reap G2325 (PresActInd), nor G3761 gather G4863 (PresActInd) into G1519 barns G0596; yet G2532 your G5216 heavenly G3770 Father G3962 feedeth G5142 (PresActInd) them G0846. Are G1308 ye G5210 not G3756 much G3123 better than G1308 (PresActInd) they G0846?
006:027 G1161 Which G1537 G5101 of you G5216 by taking thought G3309 (PresActPtc) can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) add G4369 (Aor2ActInf) one G1520 cubit G4083 unto G1909 his G0846 stature G2244?
006:028 And G2532 why G5101 take ye thought G3309 (PresActImpr) for G4012 raiment G1742? Consider G2648 (Aor2ActImpr) the lilies G2918 of the field G0068, how G4459 they grow G0837 (PresActInd); they toil G2872 (PresActInd) not G3756, neither G3761 do they spin G3514 (PresActInd):
006:029 And yet G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 even G3761 Solomon G4672 in G1722 all G3956 his G0846 glory G1391 was G4016 not G3761 arrayed G4016 (Aor2MidInd) like G5613 one G1520 of these G5130.
006:030 Wherefore G1161, if G1487 God G2316 so G3779 clothe G0294 (PresActInd) the grass G5528 of the field G0068, which to day G4594 is G5607 (PresPtc), and G2532 to morrow G0839 is cast G0906 (PresPasPtc) into G1519 the oven G2823, [shall he] not G3756 much G4183 more G3123 [clothe] you G5209, O ye of little faith G3640?
006:031 Therefore G3767 take no G3361 thought G3309 (AorActSubj), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 shall we eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj)? or G2228, What G5101 shall we drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj)? or G2228, Wherewithal G5101 shall we be clothed G4016 (Aor2MidSubj)?
006:032 (For G1063 after G1934 all G3956 these things G5023 do the Gentiles G1484 seek G1934 (PresActInd):) for G1063 your G5216 heavenly G3770 Father G3962 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 ye have need G5535 (PresActInd) of all G0537 these things G5130.
006:033 But G1161 seek ye G2212 (PresActImpr) first G4412 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, and G2532 his G0846 righteousness G1343; and G2532 all G3956 these things G5023 shall be added G4369 (FutPasInd) unto you G5213.
006:034 Take G3309 therefore G3767 no G3361 thought G3309 (AorActSubj) for G1519 the morrow G0839: for G1063 the morrow G0839 shall take thought G3309 (FutActInd) for the things G3588 of itself G1438. Sufficient G0713 unto the day G2250 [is] the evil G2549 thereof G0846.
007:001 ¶  Judge G2919 (PresActImpr) not G3361, that G3363 ye be G2919 not G3363 judged G2919 (AorPasSubj).
007:002 For G1722 with G3739 what G1063 judgment G2917 ye judge G2919 (PresActInd), ye shall be judged G2919 (FutPasInd): and G2532 with G1722 what G3739 measure G3358 ye mete G3354 (PresActInd), it shall be measured G0488 to you G5213 again G0488 (FutPasInd).
007:003 And G1161 why G5101 beholdest G0991 (PresActInd) thou the mote G2595 that is in G1722 thy G4675 brother’s G0080 eye G3788, but G1161 considerest G2657 (PresActInd) not G3756 the beam G1385 that is in G1722 thine own G4674 eye G3788?
007:004 Or G2228 how G4459 wilt thou say G2046 (FutActInd) to thy G4675 brother G0080, Let G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) me pull out G1544 (Aor2ActSubj) the mote G2595 out of G0575 thine G4675 eye G3788; and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a beam G1385 [is] in G1722 thine own G4675 eye G3788?
007:005 Thou hypocrite G5273, first G4412 cast out G1544 (Aor2ActImpr) the beam G1385 out of G1537 thine own G4675 eye G3788; and G2532 then G5119 shalt thou see clearly G1227 (FutActInd) to cast out G1544 (Aor2ActInf) the mote G2595 out of G1537 thy G4675 brother’s G0080 eye G3788.
007:006 Give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) not G3361 that which G3588 is holy G0040 unto the dogs G2965, neither G3366 cast G0906 (Aor2ActSubj) ye your G5216 pearls G3135 before G1715 swine G5519, lest G3379 they trample G2662 (AorActSubj) them G0846 under G1722 their G0846 feet G4228, and G2532 turn again G4762 (Aor2PasPtc) and rend G4486 (AorActSubj) you G5209.
007:007 Ask G0154 (PresActImpr), and G2532 it shall be given G1325 (FutPasInd) you G5213; seek G2212 (PresActImpr), and G2532 ye shall find G2147 (FutActInd); knock G2925 (PresActImpr), and G2532 it shall be opened G0455 (Fut2PasInd) unto you G5213:
007:008 For G1063 every one G3956 that asketh G0154 (PresActPtc) receiveth G2983 (PresActInd); and G2532 he that seeketh G2212 (PresActPtc) findeth G2147 (PresActInd); and G2532 to him that knocketh G2925 (PresActPtc) it shall be opened G0455 (Fut2PasInd).
007:009 Or G2228 what G5101 man G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) there of G1537 you G5216, whom G3739 if G1437 his G0846 son G5207 ask G0154 (AorActSubj) bread G0740, will he give G3361 G1929 (FutActInd) him G0846 a stone G3037?
007:010 Or G2532 if G1437 he ask G0154 (AorActSubj) a fish G2486, will he give G3361 G1929 (FutActInd) him G0846 a serpent G3789?
007:011 If G1487 ye G5210 then G3767, being G5607 (PresPtc) evil G4190, know G1492 (PerfActInd) how to give G1325 (PresActInf) good G0018 gifts G1390 unto your G5216 children G5043, how much G4214 more G3123 shall your G5216 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772 give G1325 (FutActInd) good things G0018 to them that ask G0154 (PresActPtc) him G0846?
007:012 Therefore G3767 all things G3956 whatsoever G0302 G3745 ye would G2309 (PresActSubj) that G2443 men G0444 should do G4160 (PresActSubj) to you G5213, do G4160 (PresActImpr) ye G5210 even G2532 so G3779 to them G0846: for G1063 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the law G3551 and G2532 the prophets G4396.
007:013 Enter ye in G1525 (Aor2ActImpr) at G1223 the strait G4728 gate G4439: for G3754 wide G4116 [is] the gate G4439, and G2532 broad G2149 [is] the way G3598, that leadeth G0520 (PresActPtc) to G1519 destruction G0684, and G2532 many G4183 there be G1526 (PresInd) which G3588 go in G1525 (PresMidPasDepPtc) thereat G1223 G0846:
007:014 Because G3754 strait G4728 [is] the gate G4439, and G2532 narrow G2346 (PerfPasPtc) [is] the way G3598, which G3588 leadeth G0520 (PresActPtc) unto G1519 life G2222, and G2532 few G3641 there be G1526 (PresInd) that find G2147 (PresActPtc) it G0846.
007:015 Beware G1161 G4337 (PresActImpr) of G0575 false prophets G5578, which G3748 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 you G5209 in G1722 sheep’s G4263 clothing G1742, but G1161 inwardly G2081 they are G1526 (PresInd) ravening G0727 wolves G3074.
007:016 Ye shall know G1921 (FutMidDepInd) them G0846 by G0575 their G0846 fruits G2590 G3385. Do men gather G4816 (PresActInd) grapes G4718 of G0575 thorns G0173, or G2228 figs G4810 of G0575 thistles G5146?
007:017 Even so G3779 every G3956 good G0018 tree G1186 bringeth forth G4160 (PresActInd) good G2570 fruit G2590; but G1161 a corrupt G4550 tree G1186 bringeth forth G4160 (PresActInd) evil G4190 fruit G2590.
007:018 A good G0018 tree G1186 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) bring forth G4160 (PresActInf) evil G4190 fruit G2590, neither G3761 [can] a corrupt G4550 tree G1186 bring forth G4160 (PresActInf) good G2570 fruit G2590.
007:019 Every G3956 tree G1186 that bringeth G4160 not G3361 forth G4160 (PresActPtc) good G2570 fruit G2590 is hewn down G1581 (PresPasInd), and G2532 cast G0906 (PresPasInd) into G1519 the fire G4442.
007:020 Wherefore G0686 by G0575 their G0846 fruits G2590 ye shall know G1921 (FutMidDepInd) them G0846.
007:021 Not G3756 every one G3956 that saith G3004 (PresActPtc) unto me G3427, Lord G2962, Lord G2962, shall enter G1525 (FutMidDepInd) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772; but G0235 he that doeth G4160 (PresActPtc) the will G2307 of my G3450 Father G3962 which is in G1722 heaven G3772.
007:022 Many G4183 will say G2046 (FutActInd) to me G3427 in G1722 that G1565 day G2250, Lord G2962, Lord G2962, have we G4395 not G3756 prophesied G4395 (AorActInd) in thy G4674 name G3686? and G2532 in thy G4674 name G3686 have cast out G1544 (Aor2ActInd) devils G1140? and G2532 in thy G4674 name G3686 done G4160 (AorActInd) many G4183 wonderful works G1411?
007:023 And G2532 then G5119 will I profess G3670 (FutActInd) unto them G0846, G3754 I never G3763 knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) you G5209: depart G0672 (PresActImpr) from G0575 me G1700, ye that work G2038 (PresMidPasDepPtc) iniquity G0458.
007:024 Therefore G3767 whosoever G3956 G3748 heareth G0191 (PresActInd) these G5128 sayings G3056 of mine G3450, and G2532 doeth G4160 (PresActInd) them G0846, I will liken G3666 (FutActInd) him G0846 unto a wise G5429 man G0435, which G3748 built G3618 (AorActInd) his G0846 house G3614 upon G1909 a rock G4073:
007:025 And G2532 the rain G1028 descended G2597 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the floods G4215 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the winds G0417 blew G4154 (AorActInd), and G2532 beat upon G4363 (Aor2ActInd) that G1565 house G3614; and G2532 it fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756: for G1063 it was founded G2311 (PlupfPasInd) upon G1909 a rock G4073.
007:026 And G2532 every one G3956 that heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) these G5128 sayings G3056 of mine G3450, and G2532 doeth G4160 (PresActPtc) them G0846 not G3361, shall be likened G3666 (FutPasInd) unto a foolish G3474 man G0435, which G3748 built G3618 (AorActInd) his G0846 house G3614 upon G1909 the sand G0285:
007:027 And G2532 the rain G1028 descended G2597 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the floods G4215 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the winds G0417 blew G4154 (AorActInd), and G2532 beat upon G4350 (AorActInd) that G1565 house G3614; and G2532 it fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd): and G2532 great G3173 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the fall G4431 of it G0846.
007:028 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), when G3753 Jesus G2424 had ended G4931 (AorActInd) these G5128 sayings G3056, the people G3793 were astonished G1605 (ImpfPasInd) at G1909 his G0846 doctrine G1322:
007:029 For G1063 he taught G1321 (PresActPtc) G2258 (ImpfInd) them G0846 as G5613 [one] having G2192 (PresActPtc) authority G1849, and G2532 not G3756 as G5613 the scribes G1122.
008:001 ¶  When G1161 he G0846 was come down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 the mountain G3735, great G4183 multitudes G3793 followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
008:002 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) a leper G3015 and worshipped G4352 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, if G1437 thou wilt G2309 (PresActSubj), thou canst G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) make G2511 me G3165 clean G2511 (AorActInf).
008:003 And G2532 Jesus G2424 put forth G1614 (AorActPtc) [his] hand G5495, and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I will G2309 (PresActInd); be thou clean G2511 (AorPasImpr). And G2532 immediately G2112 his G0846 leprosy G3014 was cleansed G2511 (AorPasInd).
008:004 And G2532 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, See G3708 (PresActImpr) thou tell G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) no man G3367; but G0235 go thy way G5217 (PresActImpr), shew G1166 (AorActImpr) thyself G4572 to the priest G2409, and G2532 offer G4374 (Aor2ActImpr) the gift G1435 that G3739 Moses G3475 commanded G4367 (AorActInd), for G1519 a testimony G3142 unto them G0846.
008:005 And G1161 when G1525 Jesus G2424 was entered G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 Capernaum G2584, there came G4334 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846 a centurion G1543, beseeching G3870 (PresActPtc) him G0846,
008:006 And G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, my G3450 servant G3816 lieth G0906 (PerfPasInd) at G1722 home G3614 sick of the palsy G3885, grievously G1171 tormented G0928 (PresPasPtc).
008:007 And G2532 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, I G1473 will come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and heal G2323 (FutActInd) him G0846.
008:008 The centurion G1543 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G2532 said G5346 (ImpfInd), Lord G2962, I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G2425 that G2443 thou shouldest come G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) under G5259 my G3450 roof G4721: but G0235 speak G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) the word G3056 only G3440, and G2532 my G3450 servant G3816 shall be healed G2390 (FutPasInd).
008:009 For G1063 G2532 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) a man G0444 under G5259 authority G1849, having G2192 (PresActPtc) soldiers G4757 under G5259 me G1683: and G2532 I say G3004 (PresActInd) to this G5129 [man], Go G4198 (AorPasDepImpr), and G2532 he goeth G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd); and G2532 to another G0243, Come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd); and G2532 to my G3450 servant G1401, Do G4160 (AorActImpr) this G5124, and G2532 he doeth G4160 (PresActInd) [it].
008:010 When G1161 Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], he marvelled G2296 (AorActInd), and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to them that followed G0190 (PresActPtc), Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, I have G2147 not G3761 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) so great G5118 faith G4102, no, not G3761 in G1722 Israel G2474.
008:011 And G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 many G4183 shall come G2240 (FutActInd) from G0575 the east G0395 and G2532 west G1424, and G2532 shall sit down G0347 (FutPasInd) with G3326 Abraham G0011, and G2532 Isaac G2464, and G2532 Jacob G2384, in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772.
008:012 But G1161 the children G5207 of the kingdom G0932 shall be cast out G1544 (FutPasInd) into G1519 outer G1857 darkness G4655: there G1563 shall be G2071 (FutInd) weeping G2805 and G2532 gnashing G1030 of teeth G3599.
008:013 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the centurion G1543, Go thy way G5217 (PresActImpr); and G2532 as G5613 thou hast believed G4100 (AorActInd), [so] be it done G1096 (AorPasDepImpr) unto thee G4671. And G2532 his G0846 servant G3816 was healed G2390 (AorPasInd) in G1722 the selfsame G1565 hour G5610.
008:014 And G2532 when Jesus G2424 was come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 Peter’s G4074 house G3614, he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 wife’s mother G3994 laid G0906 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 sick of a fever G4445 (PresActPtc).
008:015 And G2532 he touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) her G0846 hand G5495, and G2532 the fever G4446 left G0863 (AorActInd) her G0846: and G2532 she arose G1453 (AorPasInd), and G2532 ministered G1247 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846.
008:016 When G1161 the even G3798 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), they brought G4374 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 many G4183 that were possessed with devils G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc): and G2532 he cast out G1544 (Aor2ActInd) the spirits G4151 with [his] word G3056, and G2532 healed G2323 (AorActInd) all G3956 that were G2192 (PresActPtc) sick G2560:
008:017 That G3704 it might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) which was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G1223 Esaias G2268 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Himself G0846 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) our G2257 infirmities G0769, and G2532 bare G0941 (AorActInd) [our] sicknesses G3554.
008:018 Now G1161 when Jesus G2424 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) great G4183 multitudes G3793 about G4012 him G0846, he gave commandment G2753 (AorActInd) to depart G0565 (Aor2ActInf) unto G1519 the other side G4008.
008:019 And G2532 a certain G1520 scribe G1122 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Master G1320, I will follow G0190 (FutActInd) thee G4671 whithersoever G1437 G3699 thou goest G0565 (PresMidPasDepSubj).
008:020 And G2532 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, The foxes G0258 have G2192 (PresActInd) holes G5454, and G2532 the birds G4071 of the air G3772 [have] nests G2682; but G1161 the Son G5207 of man G0444 hath G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 where G4226 to lay G2827 (PresActSubj) [his] head G2776.
008:021 And G1161 another G2087 of his G0846 disciples G3101 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, suffer G2010 (AorActImpr) me G3427 first G4412 to go G0565 (Aor2ActInf) and G2532 bury G2290 (AorActInf) my G3450 father G3962.
008:022 But G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427; and G2532 let G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) the dead G3498 bury G2290 (AorActInf) their G1438 dead G3498.
008:023 And G2532 when he G0846 was entered G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 a ship G4143, his G0846 disciples G3101 followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
008:024 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 tempest G4578 in G1722 the sea G2281, insomuch that G5620 the ship G4143 was covered G2572 (PresPasInf) with G5259 the waves G2949: but G1161 he G0846 was asleep G2518 (ImpfActInd).
008:025 And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) to [him], and awoke G1453 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, save G4982 (AorActImpr) us G2248: we perish G0622 (PresMidInd).
008:026 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 are ye G2075 (PresInd) fearful G1169, O ye of little faith G3640? Then G5119 he arose G1453 (AorPasPtc), and rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) the winds G0417 and G2532 the sea G2281; and G2532 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 calm G1055.
008:027 But G1161 the men G0444 marvelled G2296 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What manner of man G4217 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778, that G3754 even G2532 the winds G0417 and G2532 the sea G2281 obey G5219 (PresActInd) him G0846!
008:028 And G2532 when he G0846 was come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 the other side G4008 into G1519 the country G5561 of the Gergesenes G1086, there met G5221 (AorActInd) him G0846 two G1417 possessed with devils G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc), coming G1831 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 the tombs G3419, exceeding G3029 fierce G5467, so that G5620 no G3361 man G5100 might G2480 (PresActInf) pass G3928 (Aor2ActInf) by G1223 that G1565 way G3598.
008:029 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), they cried out G2896 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 have we G2254 to do with G2532 thee G4671, Jesus G2424, thou Son G5207 of God G2316? art thou come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) hither G5602 to torment G0928 (AorActInf) us G2248 before G4253 the time G2540?
008:030 And G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a good way off G3112 from G0575 them G0846 an herd G0034 of many G4183 swine G5519 feeding G1006 (PresPasPtc).
008:031 So G1161 the devils G1142 besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), If G1487 thou cast G1544 us G2248 out G1544 (PresActInd), suffer G2010 (AorActImpr) us G2254 to go away G0565 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the herd G0034 of swine G5519.
008:032 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Go G5217 (PresActImpr). And G1161 when they were come out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), they went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the herd G0034 of swine G5519: and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the whole G3956 herd G0034 of swine G5519 ran violently G3729 (AorActInd) down G2596 a steep place G2911 into G1519 the sea G2281, and G2532 perished G0599 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the waters G5204.
008:033 And G1161 they that kept G1006 (PresActPtc) them fled G5343 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 went their ways G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the city G4172, and told G0518 (AorActInd) every thing G3956, and G2532 what was befallen to the possessed of the devils G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
008:034 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the whole G3956 city G4172 came out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 meet G4877 Jesus G2424: and G2532 when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, they besought G3870 (AorActInd) [him] that G3704 he would depart G3327 (Aor2ActSubj) out of G0575 their G0846 coasts G3725.
009:001 ¶  And G2532 he entered G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 a ship G4143, and passed over G1276 (AorActInd), and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 his own G2398 city G4172.
009:002 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), they brought G4374 (ImpfActInd) to him G0846 a man sick of the palsy G3885, lying G0906 (PerfPasPtc) on G1909 a bed G2825: and G2532 Jesus G2424 seeing G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 faith G4102 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the sick of the palsy G3885; Son G5043, be of good cheer G2293 (PresActImpr); thy G4675 sins G0266 be forgiven G0863 (PerfPasInd) thee G4671.
009:003 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), certain G5100 of the scribes G1122 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) within G1722 themselves G1438, This G3778 [man] blasphemeth G0987 (PresActInd).
009:004 And G2532 Jesus G2424 knowing G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 thoughts G1761 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Wherefore G2444 think G1760 (PresMidPasDepInd) ye G5210 evil G4190 in G1722 your G5216 hearts G2588?
009:005 For G1063 whether G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) easier G2123, to say G2036 (Aor2ActInf), [Thy] sins G0266 be forgiven G0863 (PerfPasInd) thee G4671; or G2228 to say G2036 (Aor2ActInf), Arise G1453 (AorMidImpr), and G2532 walk G4043 (PresActImpr)?
009:006 But G1161 that G2443 ye may know G1492 (PerfActSubj) that G3754 the Son G5207 of man G0444 hath G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 on G1909 earth G1093 to forgive G0863 (PresActInf) sins G0266, (then G5119 saith he G3004 (PresActInd) to the sick of the palsy G3885,) Arise G1453 (AorPasPtc), take up G0142 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 bed G2825, and G2532 go G5217 (PresActImpr) unto G1519 thine G4675 house G3624.
009:007 And G2532 he arose G1453 (AorPasPtc), and departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 his G0846 house G3624.
009:008 But G1161 when the multitudes G3793 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], they marvelled G2296 (AorActInd), and G2532 glorified G1392 (AorActInd) God G2316, which G3588 had given G1325 (Aor2ActPtc) such G5108 power G1849 unto men G0444.
009:009 And as G2532 Jesus G2424 passed forth G3855 (PresActPtc) from thence G1564, he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a man G0444, named G3004 (PresPasPtc) Matthew G3156, sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) at G1909 the receipt of custom G5058: and G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427. And G2532 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
009:010 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as Jesus G2424 sat at meat G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the house G3614, G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), many G4183 publicans G5057 and G2532 sinners G0268 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and sat down G4873 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) with him G0846 and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101.
009:011 And G2532 when the Pharisees G5330 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto his G0846 disciples G3101, Why G1302 eateth G2068 (PresActInd) your G5216 Master G1320 with G3326 publicans G5057 and G2532 sinners G0268?
009:012 But G1161 when Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [that], he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, They that be G2192 (PresActInd) whole G2480 (PresActPtc) need G5532 not G3756 a physician G2395, but G0235 they that are G2192 (PresActPtc) sick G2560.
009:013 But G1161 go ye G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) and learn G3129 (Aor2ActImpr) what G5101 [that] meaneth G2076 (PresInd), I will G2309 (PresActInd) have mercy G1656, and G2532 not G3756 sacrifice G2378: for G1063 I am G2064 not G3756 come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to call G2564 (AorActInf) the righteous G1342, but G0235 sinners G0268 to G1519 repentance G3341.
009:014 Then G5119 came G4334 (PresMidPasDepInd) to him G0846 the disciples G3101 of John G2491, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Why G1302 do we G2249 and G2532 the Pharisees G5330 fast G3522 (PresActInd) oft G4183, but G1161 thy G4675 disciples G3101 fast G3522 (PresActInd) not G3756?
009:015 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Can G3361 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) the children G5207 of the bridechamber G3567 mourn G3996 (PresActInf), as long as G1909 G3745 the bridegroom G3566 is G2076 (PresInd) with G3326 them G0846? but G1161 the days G2250 will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd), when G3752 the bridegroom G3566 shall be taken G0522 (AorPasSubj) from G0575 them G0846, and G2532 then G5119 shall they fast G3522 (FutActInd).
009:016 G1161 No man G3762 putteth G1911 (PresActInd) a piece G1915 of new G0046 cloth G4470 unto G1909 an old G3820 garment G2440, for G1063 that which is put in to fill it up G4138 taketh G0142 (PresActInd) G0846 from G0575 the garment G2440, and G2532 the rent G4978 is made G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) worse G5501.
009:017 Neither G3761 do men put G0906 (PresActInd) new G3501 wine G3631 into G1519 old G3820 bottles G0779: else G1490 the bottles G0779 break G4486 (PresPasInd), and G2532 the wine G3631 runneth out G1632 (PresPasInd), and G2532 the bottles G0779 perish G0622 (FutMidInd): but G0235 they put G0906 (PresActInd) new G3501 wine G3631 into G1519 new G2537 bottles G0779, and G2532 both G0297 are preserved G4933 (PresPasInd).
009:018 While he G0846 spake G2980 (PresActPtc) these things G5023 unto them G0846, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) a certain G1520 ruler G0758, and worshipped G4352 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 My G3450 daughter G2364 is even now G0737 dead G5053 (AorActInd): but G0235 come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and lay G2007 (Aor2ActImpr) thy G4675 hand G5495 upon G1909 her G0846, and G2532 she shall live G2198 (FutMidDepInd).
009:019 And G2532 Jesus G2424 arose G1453 (AorPasPtc), and followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 [so did] his G0846 disciples G3101.
009:020 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a woman G1135, which was diseased with an issue of blood G0131 (PresActPtc) twelve G1427 years G2094, came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) behind G3693 [him], and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) the hem G2899 of his G0846 garment G2440:
009:021 For G1063 she said G3004 (ImpfActInd) within G1722 herself G1438, If G1437 I may G0680 but G3440 touch G0680 (AorMidSubj) his G0846 garment G2440, I shall be whole G4982 (FutPasInd).
009:022 But G1161 Jesus G2424 turned him about G1994 (Aor2PasPtc), and G2532 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) her G0846, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Daughter G2364, be of good comfort G2293 (PresActImpr); thy G4675 faith G4102 hath made G4982 thee G4571 whole G4982 (PerfActInd). And G2532 the woman G1135 was made whole G4982 (AorPasInd) from G0575 that G1565 hour G5610.
009:023 And G2532 when Jesus G2424 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the ruler’s G0758 house G3614, and G2532 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the minstrels G0834 and G2532 the people G3793 making a noise G2350 (PresPasPtc),
009:024 He said G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Give place G0402 (PresActImpr): for G1063 the maid G2877 is G0599 not G3756 dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd), but G0235 sleepeth G2518 (PresActInd). And G2532 they laughed G2606 him G0846 to scorn G2606 (ImpfActInd).
009:025 But G1161 when G3753 the people G3793 were put forth G1544 (AorPasInd), he went in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc), and took G2902 (AorActInd) her G0846 by the hand G5495, and G2532 the maid G2877 arose G1453 (AorPasInd).
009:026 And G2532 the fame G5345 hereof G3778 went abroad G1831 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 all G3650 that G1565 land G1093.
009:027 And G2532 when Jesus G2424 departed G3855 (PresActPtc) thence G1564, two G1417 blind men G5185 followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846, crying G2896 (PresActPtc), and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), [Thou] Son G5207 of David G1138, have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on us G2248.
009:028 And G1161 when he was come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the house G3614, the blind men G5185 came G4334 (AorActInd) to him G0846: and G2532 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Believe ye G4100 (PresActImpr) that G3754 I am able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) to do G4160 (AorActInf) this G5124? They said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Yea G3483, Lord G2962.
009:029 Then G5119 touched he G0680 (AorMidDepInd) their G0846 eyes G3788, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), According G2596 to your G5216 faith G4102 be it G1096 (AorPasDepImpr) unto you G5213.
009:030 And G2532 their G0846 eyes G3788 were opened G0455 (AorPasInd); and G2532 Jesus G2424 straitly charged G1690 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), See G3708 (PresActImpr) [that] no man G3367 know G1097 (PresActImpr) [it].
009:031 But G1161 they, when they were departed G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), spread abroad G1310 his G0846 fame G1310 (AorActInd) in G1722 all G3650 that G1565 country G1093.
009:032 As G1161 they G0846 went out G1831 (PresMidPasDepPtc), behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), they brought G4374 (AorActInd) to him G0846 a dumb G2974 man G0444 possessed with a devil G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
009:033 And G2532 when the devil G1140 was cast out G1544 (AorPasPtc), the dumb G2974 spake G2980 (AorActInd): and G2532 the multitudes G3793 marvelled G2296 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 It was never G3763 so G3779 seen G5316 (Aor2PasDepSubj) in G1722 Israel G2474.
009:034 But G1161 the Pharisees G5330 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), He casteth out G1544 (PresActInd) devils G1140 through G1722 the prince G0758 of the devils G1140.
009:035 And G2532 Jesus G2424 went about G4013 (ImpfActInd) all G3956 the cities G4172 and G2532 villages G2968, teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) in G1722 their G0846 synagogues G4864, and G2532 preaching G2784 (PresActPtc) the gospel G2098 of the kingdom G0932, and G2532 healing G2323 (PresActPtc) every G3956 sickness G3554 and G2532 every G3956 disease G3119 among G1722 the people G2992.
009:036 But G1161 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the multitudes G3793, he was moved with compassion G4697 (AorPasDepInd) on G4012 them G0846, because G3754 they fainted G2258 (ImpfInd) G1590 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 were scattered abroad G4496 (PerfPasPtc), as G5616 sheep G4263 having G2192 (PresActPtc) no G3361 shepherd G4166.
009:037 Then G5119 saith G3004 (PresActInd) he unto his G0846 disciples G3101, The harvest G2326 truly G3303 [is] plenteous G4183, but G1161 the labourers G2040 [are] few G3641;
009:038 Pray ye G1189 (AorPasDepImpr) therefore G3767 the Lord G2962 of the harvest G2326, that G3704 he will send forth G1544 (Aor2ActSubj) labourers G2040 into G1519 his G0846 harvest G2326.
010:001 ¶  And G2532 when he had called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) unto [him] his G0846 twelve G1427 disciples G3101, he gave G1325 (AorActInd) them G0846 power G1849 [against] unclean G0169 spirits G4151, to G5620 cast G1544 them G0846 out G1544 (PresActInf), and G2532 to heal G2323 (PresActInf) all manner G3956 of sickness G3554 and G2532 all manner G3956 of disease G3119.
010:002 Now G1161 the names G3686 of the twelve G1427 apostles G0652 are G2076 (PresInd) these G5023; The first G4413, Simon G4613, who G3588 is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Peter G4074, and G2532 Andrew G0406 his G0846 brother G0080; James G2385 [the son] of G3588 Zebedee G2199, and G2532 John G2491 his G0846 brother G0080;
010:003 Philip G5376, and G2532 Bartholomew G0918; Thomas G2381, and G2532 Matthew G3156 the publican G5057; James G2385 [the son] of G3588 Alphaeus G0256, and G2532 Lebbaeus G3002, whose surname was G1941 (AorPasPtc) Thaddaeus G2280;
010:004 Simon G4613 the Canaanite G2581, and G2532 Judas G2455 Iscariot G2469, who G3588 also G2532 betrayed G3860 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846.
010:005 These G5128 twelve G1427 Jesus G2424 sent forth G0649 (AorActInd), and commanded G3853 (AorActPtc) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Go G0565 (Aor2ActSubj) not G3361 into G1519 the way G3598 of the Gentiles G1484, and G2532 into G1519 [any] city G4172 of the Samaritans G4541 enter ye G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) not G3361:
010:006 But G1161 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) rather G3123 to G4314 the lost G0622 (Perf2ActPtc) sheep G4263 of the house G3624 of Israel G2474.
010:007 And G1161 as ye go G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc), preach G2784 (PresActImpr), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 The kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is at hand G1448 (PerfActInd).
010:008 Heal G2323 (PresActImpr) the sick G0770 (PresActPtc), cleanse G2511 (PresActImpr) the lepers G3015, raise G1453 (PresActImpr) the dead G3498, cast out G1544 (PresActImpr) devils G1140: freely G1432 ye have received G2983 (Aor2ActInd), freely G1432 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr).
010:009 Provide G2932 (AorMidDepSubj) neither G3361 gold G5557, nor G3366 silver G0696, nor G3366 brass G5475 in G1519 your G5216 purses G2223,
010:010 Nor G3361 scrip G4082 for G1519 [your] journey G3598, neither G3366 two G1417 coats G5509, neither G3366 shoes G5266, nor G3366 yet staves G4464: for G1063 the workman G2040 is G2076 (PresInd) worthy G0514 of his G0846 meat G5160.
010:011 And G1161 into G1519 whatsoever G0302 G3739 city G4172 or G2228 town G2968 ye shall enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj), enquire G1833 (AorActImpr) who G5101 in G1722 it G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) worthy G0514; and there G2546 abide G3306 (AorActImpr) till G0302 G2193 ye go thence G1831 (Aor2ActSubj).
010:012 And G1161 when ye come G1525 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 an house G3614, salute G0782 (AorMidDepImpr) it G0846.
010:013 And G2532 if G1437 G3303 the house G3614 be G5600 (PresSubj) worthy G0514, let your G5216 peace G1515 come G2064 (Aor2ActImpr) upon G1909 it G0846: but G1161 if G3362 it be G5600 (PresSubj) not G3362 worthy G0514, let your G5216 peace G1515 return G1994 (Aor2PasImpr) to G4314 you G5209.
010:014 And G2532 whosoever G3739 shall G1209 not G3362 receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) you G5209, nor G3366 hear G0191 (AorActSubj) your G5216 words G3056, when ye depart out G1831 (PresMidPasDepPtc) of that G1565 house G3614 or G2228 city G4172, shake off G1621 (AorActImpr) the dust G2868 of your G5216 feet G4228.
010:015 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, It shall be G2071 (FutInd) more tolerable G0414 for the land G1093 of Sodom G4670 and G2532 Gomorrha G1116 in G1722 the day G2250 of judgment G2920, than G2228 for that G1565 city G4172.
010:016 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 send G0649 you G5209 forth G0649 (PresActInd) as G5613 sheep G4263 in G1722 the midst G3319 of wolves G3074: be ye G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) therefore G3767 wise G5429 as G5613 serpents G3789, and G2532 harmless G0185 as G5613 doves G4058.
010:017 But G1161 beware G4337 (PresActImpr) of G0575 men G0444: for G1063 they will deliver G3860 you G5209 up G3860 (FutActInd) to G1519 the councils G4892, and G2532 they will scourge G3146 (FutActInd) you G5209 in G1722 their G0846 synagogues G4864;
010:018 And G2532 ye shall be brought G0071 (FutPasInd) before G1909 governors G2232 and G2532 G1161 kings G0935 for my G1752 sake G1700, for G1519 a testimony G3142 against them G0846 and G2532 the Gentiles G1484.
010:019 But G1161 when G3752 they deliver G3860 you G5209 up G3860 (PresActSubj), take G3309 no G3361 thought G3309 (AorActSubj) how G4459 or G2228 what G5101 ye shall speak G2980 (AorActSubj): for G1063 it shall be given G1325 (FutPasInd) you G5213 in G1722 that same G1565 hour G5610 what G5101 ye shall speak G2980 (FutActInd).
010:020 For G1063 it is G2075 (PresInd) not G3756 ye G5210 that speak G2980 (PresActPtc), but G0235 the Spirit G4151 of your G5216 Father G3962 which G3588 speaketh G2980 (PresActPtc) in G1722 you G5213.
010:021 And G1161 the brother G0080 shall deliver up G3860 (FutActInd) the brother G0080 to G1519 death G2288, and G2532 the father G3962 the child G5043: and G2532 the children G5043 shall rise up G1881 (FutMidDepInd) against G1909 [their] parents G1118, and G2532 cause G2289 them G0846 to be put to death G2289 (FutActInd).
010:022 And G2532 ye shall G2071 (FutInd) be hated G3404 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 all G3956 [men] for G1223 my G3450 name’s sake G3686: but G1161 he that G3778 endureth G5278 (AorActPtc) to G1519 the end G5056 shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd).
010:023 But G1161 when G3752 they persecute G1377 (PresActSubj) you G5209 in G1722 this G5026 city G4172, flee ye G5343 (PresActImpr) into G1519 another G0243: for G1063 verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Ye shall G5055 not G3364 have gone over G5055 (AorActSubj) the cities G4172 of Israel G2474, till G2193 the Son G5207 of man G0444 be G0302 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj).
010:024 The disciple G3101 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 above G5228 [his] master G1320, nor G3761 the servant G1401 above G5228 his G0846 lord G2962.
010:025 It is enough G0713 for the disciple G3101 that G2443 he be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) as G5613 his G0846 master G1320, and G2532 the servant G1401 as G5613 his G0846 lord G2962. If G1487 they have called G2564 (AorActInd) the master of the house G3617 Beelzebub G0954, how much G4214 more G3123 [shall they call] them of his G0846 household G3615?
010:026 Fear G5399 (AorPasDepImpr) them G0846 not G3361 therefore G3767: for G1063 there is G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3762 covered G2572 (PerfPasPtc), that G3739 shall G0601 not G3756 be revealed G0601 (FutPasInd); and G2532 hid G2927, that G3739 shall G1097 not G3756 be known G1097 (FutPasInd).
010:027 What G3739 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213 in G1722 darkness G4653, [that] speak ye G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) in G1722 light G5457: and G2532 what G3739 ye hear G0191 (PresActInd) in G1519 the ear G3775, [that] preach ye G2784 (AorActImpr) upon G1909 the housetops G1430.
010:028 And G2532 fear G5399 (AorPasDepImpr) G0575 not G3361 them which G3588 kill G0615 (PresActPtc) the body G4983, but G1161 are G1410 not G3361 able G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to kill G0615 (AorActInf) the soul G5590: but G1161 rather G3123 fear G5399 (AorPasDepImpr) him which G3588 is able G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to destroy G0622 (AorActInf) both G2532 soul G5590 and G2532 body G4983 in G1722 hell G1067.
010:029 Are G4453 not G3780 two G1417 sparrows G4765 sold G4453 (PresPasInd) for a farthing G0787? and G2532 one G1520 of G1537 them G0846 shall G4098 not G3756 fall G4098 (FutMidDepInd) on G1909 the ground G1093 without G0427 your G5216 Father G3962.
010:030 But G1161 the very G2532 hairs G2359 of your G5216 head G2776 are G1526 (PresInd) all G3956 numbered G0705 (PerfPasPtc).
010:031 Fear ye G5399 (AorPasDepImpr) not G3361 therefore G3767, ye G5210 are of more value G1308 (PresActInd) than many G4183 sparrows G4765.
010:032 Whosoever G3956 G3748 therefore G3767 shall confess G3670 (FutActInd) G1722 me G1698 before G1715 men G0444, G1722 him G0846 will I confess G3670 (FutActInd) also G2504 before G1715 my G3450 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772.
010:033 But G1161 whosoever G3748 shall G0302 deny G0720 (AorMidDepSubj) me G3165 before G1715 men G0444, him G0846 will I also G2504 deny G0720 (FutMidDepInd) before G1715 my G3450 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772.
010:034 Think G3543 (AorActSubj) not G3361 that G3754 I am come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to send G0906 (Aor2ActInf) peace G1515 on G1909 earth G1093: I came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 to send G0906 (Aor2ActInf) peace G1515, but G0235 a sword G3162.
010:035 For G1063 I am come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to set G1369 a man G0444 at variance G1369 (AorActInf) against G2596 his G0846 father G3962, and G2532 the daughter G2364 against G2596 her G0846 mother G3384, and G2532 the daughter in law G3565 against G2596 her G0846 mother in law G3994.
010:036 And G2532 a man’s G0444 foes G2190 [shall be] they of his own G0846 household G3615.
010:037 He that loveth G5368 (PresActPtc) father G3962 or G2228 mother G3384 more than G5228 me G1691 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G0514 of me G3450: and G2532 he that loveth G5368 (PresActPtc) son G5207 or G2228 daughter G2364 more than G5228 me G1691 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G0514 of me G3450.
010:038 And G2532 he G3739 that taketh G2983 (PresActInd) not G3756 his G0846 cross G4716, and G2532 followeth G0190 (PresActInd) after G3694 me G3450, is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G0514 of me G3450.
010:039 He that findeth G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) his G0846 life G5590 shall lose G0622 (FutActInd) it G0846: and G2532 he that loseth G0622 (AorActPtc) his G0846 life G5590 for my G1700 sake G1752 shall find G2147 (FutActInd) it G0846.
010:040 He that receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepPtc) you G5209 receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepInd) me G1691, and G2532 he that receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepPtc) me G1691 receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepInd) him that sent G0649 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
010:041 He that receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepPtc) a prophet G4396 in G1519 the name G3686 of a prophet G4396 shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) a prophet’s G4396 reward G3408; and G2532 he that receiveth G2983 (FutMidDepInd) a righteous man G1342 in G1519 the name G3686 of a righteous man G1342 shall receive G1209 (PresMidPasDepPtc) a righteous man’s G1342 reward G3408.
010:042 And G2532 whosoever G3739 G1437 shall give to drink G4222 (AorActSubj) unto one G1520 of these G5130 little ones G3398 a cup G4221 of cold G5593 [water] only G3440 in G1519 the name G3686 of a disciple G3101, verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, he shall in no wise G3364 lose G0622 (AorActSubj) his G0846 reward G3408.
011:001 ¶  And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), when G3753 Jesus G2424 had made an end G5055 (AorActInd) of commanding G1299 (PresActPtc) his G0846 twelve G1427 disciples G3101, he departed G3327 (Aor2ActInd) thence G1564 to teach G1321 (PresActInf) and G2532 to preach G2784 (PresActInf) in G1722 their G0846 cities G4172.
011:002 Now G1161 when John G2491 had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) in G1722 the prison G1201 the works G2041 of Christ G5547, he sent G3992 (AorActPtc) two G1417 of his G0846 disciples G3101,
011:003 And said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 he that should come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc), or G2228 do we look G4328 (PresActInd) for another G2087?
011:004 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Go G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) and shew G0518 John G2491 again G0518 (AorActImpr) those things which G3739 ye do hear G0191 (PresActInd) and G2532 see G0991 (PresActInd):
011:005 The blind G5185 receive their sight G0308 (PresActInd), and G2532 the lame G5560 walk G4043 (PresActInd), the lepers G3015 are cleansed G2511 (PresPasInd), and G2532 the deaf G2974 hear G0191 (PresActInd), the dead G3498 are raised up G1453 (PresPasInd), and G2532 the poor G4434 have the gospel preached to them G2097 (PresPasInd).
011:006 And G2532 blessed G3107 is G2076 (PresInd) [he], whosoever G3739 shall G4624 not G3362 be offended G4624 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 me G1698.
011:007 And G1161 as G5130 they departed G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc), Jesus G2424 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf) unto the multitudes G3793 concerning G4012 John G2491, What G5101 went ye G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out into G1519 the wilderness G2048 to see G2300 (AorMidDepInf)? A reed G2563 shaken G4531 (PresPasPtc) with G5259 the wind G0417?
011:008 But G0235 what G5101 went ye out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) for to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf)? A man G0444 clothed G0294 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 soft G3120 raiment G2440? behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), they that wear G5409 (PresActPtc) soft G3120 [clothing] are G1526 (PresInd) in G1722 kings G0935 ’ houses G3624.
011:009 But G0235 what G5101 went ye out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) for to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf)? A prophet G4396? yea G3483, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, and G2532 more G4055 than a prophet G4396.
011:010 For G1063 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) [he], of G4012 whom G3739 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 send G0649 (PresActInd) my G3450 messenger G0032 before G4253 thy G4675 face G4383, which G3739 shall prepare G2680 (FutActInd) thy G4675 way G3598 before G1715 thee G4675.
011:011 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Among G1722 them that are born G1084 of women G1135 there hath G1453 not G3756 risen G1453 (PerfPasInd) a greater than G3187 John G2491 the Baptist G0910: notwithstanding G1161 he that is least G3398 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) greater than G3187 he G0846.
011:012 And G1161 from G0575 the days G2250 of John G2491 the Baptist G0910 until G2193 now G0737 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 suffereth violence G0971 (PresPasInd), and G2532 the violent G0973 take G0726 it G0846 by force G0726 (PresActInd).
011:013 For G1063 all G3956 the prophets G4396 and G2532 the law G3551 prophesied G4395 (AorActInd) until G2193 John G2491.
011:014 And G2532 if G1487 ye will G2309 (PresActInd) receive G1209 (AorMidDepInf) [it], this G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) Elias G2243, which G3588 was for G3195 (PresActPtc) to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInf).
011:015 He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) ears G3775 to hear G0191 (PresActInf), let him hear G0191 (PresActImpr).
011:016 But G1161 whereunto G5101 shall I liken G3666 (FutActInd) this G5026 generation G1074? It is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 unto children G3808 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the markets G0058, and G2532 calling G4377 (PresActPtc) unto their G0846 fellows G2083,
011:017 And G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), We have piped G0832 (AorActInd) unto you G5213, and G2532 ye have G3738 not G3756 danced G3738 (AorMidDepInd); we have mourned G2354 (AorActInd) unto you G5213, and G2532 ye have G2875 not G3756 lamented G2875 (AorMidInd).
011:018 For G1063 John G2491 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) neither G3383 eating G2068 (PresActPtc) nor G3383 drinking G4095 (PresActPtc), and G2532 they say G3004 (PresActInd), He hath G2192 (PresActInd) a devil G1140.
011:019 The Son G5207 of man G0444 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) eating G2068 (PresActPtc) and G2532 drinking G4095 (PresActPtc), and G2532 they say G3004 (PresActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a man G0444 gluttonous G5314, and G2532 a winebibber G3630, a friend G5384 of publicans G5057 and G2532 sinners G0268. But G2532 wisdom G4678 is justified G1344 (AorPasInd) of G0575 her G0846 children G5043.
011:020 Then G5119 began he G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to upbraid G3679 (PresActInf) the cities G4172 wherein G1722 G3739 most G4118 of his G0846 mighty works G1411 were done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), because G3754 they repented G3340 (AorActInd) not G3756:
011:021 Woe G3759 unto thee G4671, Chorazin G5523! woe G3759 unto thee G4671, Bethsaida G0966! for G3754 if G1487 the mighty works G1411, which G3588 were done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) in G1722 you G5213, had been done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 Tyre G5184 and G2532 Sidon G4605, they would have repented G3340 (AorActInd) long ago G0302 G3819 in G1722 sackcloth G4526 and G2532 ashes G4700.
011:022 But G4133 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, It shall be G2071 (FutInd) more tolerable G0414 for Tyre G5184 and G2532 Sidon G4605 at G1722 the day G2250 of judgment G2920, than G2228 for you G5213.
011:023 And G2532 thou G4771, Capernaum G2584, which G3588 art exalted G5312 (AorPasPtc) unto G2193 heaven G3772, shalt be brought down G2601 (FutPasInd) to G2193 hell G0086: for G3754 if G1487 the mighty works G1411, which G3588 have been done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) in G1722 thee G4671, had been done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 Sodom G4670, it would have remained G0302 G3306 (AorActInd) until G3360 this day G4594.
011:024 But G4133 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 it shall be G2071 (FutInd) more tolerable G0414 for the land G1093 of Sodom G4670 in G1722 the day G2250 of judgment G2920, than G2228 for thee G4671.
011:025 At G1722 that G1565 time G2540 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I thank G1843 (PresMidInd) thee G4671, O Father G3962, Lord G2962 of heaven G3772 and G2532 earth G1093, because G3754 thou hast hid G0613 (AorActInd) these things G5023 from G0575 the wise G4680 and G2532 prudent G4908, and G2532 hast revealed G0601 (AorActInd) them G0846 unto babes G3516.
011:026 Even so G3483, Father G3962: for G3754 so G3779 it seemed G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) good G2107 in thy G4675 sight G1715.
011:027 All things G3956 are delivered G3860 (AorPasInd) unto me G3427 of G5259 my G3450 Father G3962: and G2532 no man G3762 knoweth G1921 (PresActInd) the Son G5207, but G1508 the Father G3962; neither G3761 knoweth G1921 (PresActInd) any man G5100 the Father G3962, save G1508 the Son G5207, and [he] G2532 to G3739 whomsoever G1437 the Son G5207 will G1014 (PresMidPasDepSubj) reveal G0601 (AorActInf) [him].
011:028 Come G1205 (Impr) unto G4314 me G3165, all G3956 [ye] that labour G2872 (PresActPtc) and G2532 are heavy laden G5412 (PerfPasPtc), and I G2504 will give G0373 you G5209 rest G0373 (FutActInd).
011:029 Take G0142 (AorActImpr) my G3450 yoke G2218 upon G1909 you G5209, and G2532 learn G3129 (Aor2ActImpr) of G0575 me G1700; for G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) meek G4235 and G2532 lowly G5011 in heart G2588: and G2532 ye shall find G2147 (FutActInd) rest G0372 unto your G5216 souls G5590.
011:030 For G1063 my G3450 yoke G2218 [is] easy G5543, and G2532 my G3450 burden G5413 is G2076 (PresInd) light G1645.
012:001 ¶  At G1722 that G1565 time G2540 Jesus G2424 went G4198 (AorPasDepInd) on the sabbath day G4521 through G1223 the corn G4702; and G1161 his G0846 disciples G3101 were an hungred G3983 (AorActInd), and G2532 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to pluck G5089 (PresActInf) the ears of corn G4719, and G2532 to eat G2068 (PresActInf).
012:002 But G1161 when the Pharisees G5330 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), thy G4675 disciples G3101 do G4160 (PresActInd) that which G3739 is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) to do G4160 (PresActInf) upon G1722 the sabbath day G4521.
012:003 But G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Have ye G0314 not G3756 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd) what G5101 David G1138 did G4160 (AorActInd), when G3753 he G0846 was an hungred G3983 (AorActInd), and G2532 they G3326 that were with him G0846;
012:004 How G4459 he entered into G1525 (Aor2ActInd) G1519 the house G3624 of God G2316, and G2532 did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) the shewbread G0740 G4286, which G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresPtc) for him G0846 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf), neither for G3761 them which G3326 were with him G0846, but G1508 only G3441 for the priests G2409?
012:005 Or G2228 have ye G0314 not G3756 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the law G3551, how that G3754 on the sabbath days G4521 the priests G2409 in G1722 the temple G2411 profane G0953 (PresActInd) the sabbath G4521, and G2532 are G1526 (PresInd) blameless G0338?
012:006 But G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 in this place G5602 is [one] G2076 (PresInd) greater than G3187 the temple G2411.
012:007 But G1161 if G1487 ye had known G1097 (PlupfActInd) what G5101 [this] meaneth G2076 (PresInd), I will have G2309 (PresActInd) mercy G1656, and G2532 not G3756 sacrifice G2378, ye would G0302 not G3756 have condemned G2613 (AorActInd) the guiltless G0338.
012:008 For G1063 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) Lord G2962 even G2532 of the sabbath day G4521.
012:009 And G2532 when he was departed G3327 (Aor2ActPtc) thence G1564, he went G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 their G0846 synagogue G4864:
012:010 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a man G0444 which had G2192 (PresActPtc) [his] hand G5495 withered G3584. And G2532 they asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Is it lawful G1487 G1832 (PresInd) to heal G2323 (PresActInf) on the sabbath days G4521? that G2443 they might accuse G2723 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
012:011 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, What G5101 man G0444 shall there be G2071 (FutInd) among G1537 you G5216, that G3739 shall have G2192 (FutActInd) one G1520 sheep G4263, and G2532 if G1437 it G5124 fall G1706 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 a pit G0999 on the sabbath day G4521, will he G2902 not G3780 lay hold G2902 (FutActInd) on it G0846, and G2532 lift [it] out G1453 (FutActInd)?
012:012 How much G4214 then G3767 is a man G0444 better than G1308 (PresActInd) a sheep G4263? Wherefore G5620 it is lawful G1832 (PresInd) to do G4160 (PresActInf) well G2573 on the sabbath days G4521.
012:013 Then G5119 saith G3004 (PresActInd) he to the man G0444, Stretch forth G1614 (AorActImpr) thine G4675 hand G5495. And G2532 he stretched [it] forth G1614 (AorActInd); and G2532 it was restored G0600 (AorPasInd) whole G5199, like as G5613 the other G0243.
012:014 Then G1161 the Pharisees G5330 went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and held G2983 (Aor2ActInd) a council G4824 against G2596 him G0846, how G3704 they might destroy G0622 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
012:015 But G1161 when Jesus G2424 knew G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he withdrew himself G0402 (AorActInd) from thence G1564: and G2532 great G4183 multitudes G3793 followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 he healed G2323 (AorActInd) them G0846 all G3956;
012:016 And G2532 charged G2008 (AorActInd) them G0846 that G3363 they should G4160 not G3363 make G4160 (AorActSubj) him G0846 known G5318:
012:017 That G3704 it might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G1223 Esaias G2268 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
012:018 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) my G3450 servant G3816, whom G3739 I have chosen G0140 (AorActInd); my G3450 beloved G0027, in G1519 whom G3739 my G3450 soul G5590 is well pleased G2106 (AorActInd): I will put G5087 (FutActInd) my G3450 spirit G4151 upon G1909 him G0846, and G2532 he shall shew G0518 (FutActInd) judgment G2920 to the Gentiles G1484.
012:019 He shall G2051 not G3756 strive G2051 (FutActInd), nor G3761 cry G2905 (FutActInd); neither G3761 shall any man G5100 hear G0191 (FutActInd) his G0846 voice G5456 in G1722 the streets G4113.
012:020 A bruised G4937 (PerfPasPtc) reed G2563 shall he G2608 not G3756 break G2608 (AorActInd), and G2532 smoking G5188 (PresPasPtc) flax G3043 shall he G4570 not G3756 quench G4570 (FutActInd), till G2193 G0302 he send forth G1544 (Aor2ActSubj) judgment G2920 unto G1519 victory G3534.
012:021 And G2532 in G1722 his G0846 name G3686 shall G1679 the Gentiles G1484 trust G1679 (FutActInd).
012:022 Then G5119 was brought G4374 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 one possessed with a devil G1139 (PresMidPasDepPtc), blind G5185, and G2532 dumb G2974: and G2532 he healed G2323 (AorActInd) him G0846, insomuch that G5620 the blind G5185 and G2532 dumb G2974 both G2532 spake G2980 (PresActInf) and G2532 saw G0991 (PresActInf).
012:023 And G2532 all G3956 the people G3793 were amazed G1839 (ImpfMidInd), and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Is G2076 (PresInd) not G3385 this G3778 the son G5207 of David G1138?
012:024 But G1161 when the Pharisees G5330 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), This G3778 [fellow] doth G1544 not G3756 cast out G1544 (PresActInd) devils G1140, but G1508 by G1722 Beelzebub G0954 the prince G0758 of the devils G1140.
012:025 And G1161 Jesus G2424 knew G1492 (PerfActPtc) their G0846 thoughts G1761, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Every G3956 kingdom G0932 divided G3307 (AorPasPtc) against G2596 itself G1438 is brought to desolation G2049 (PresPasInd); and G2532 every G3956 city G4172 or G2228 house G3614 divided G3307 (AorPasPtc) against G2596 itself G1438 shall G2476 not G3756 stand G2476 (FutPasInd):
012:026 And G2532 if G1487 Satan G4567 cast out G1544 (PresActInd) Satan G4567, he is divided G3307 (AorPasInd) against G1909 himself G1438; how G4459 shall G2476 then G3767 his G0846 kingdom G0932 stand G2476 (FutPasInd)?
012:027 And G2532 if G1487 I G1473 by G1722 Beelzebub G0954 cast out G1544 (PresActInd) devils G1140, by G1722 whom G5101 do your G5216 children G5207 cast [them] out G1544 (PresActInd)? therefore G5124 G1223 they G0846 shall be G2071 (FutInd) your G5216 judges G2923.
012:028 But G1161 if G1487 I G1473 cast out G1544 (PresActInd) devils G1140 by G1722 the Spirit G4151 of God G2316, then G0686 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is come G5348 (AorActInd) unto G1909 you G5209.
012:029 Or G2228 else how G4459 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) one G5100 enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 a strong man’s G2478 house G3614, and G2532 spoil G1283 (AorActInf) his G0846 goods G4632, except G3362 he first G4412 bind G1210 (AorActSubj) the strong man G2478? and G2532 then G5119 he will spoil G1283 (FutActInd) his G0846 house G3614.
012:030 He that is G5607 (PresPtc) not G3361 with G3326 me G1700 is G2076 (PresInd) against G2596 me G1700; and G2532 he that gathereth G4863 (PresActPtc) not G3361 with G3326 me G1700 scattereth abroad G4650 (PresActInd).
012:031 Wherefore G1223 G5124 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, All manner of G3956 sin G0266 and G2532 blasphemy G0988 shall be forgiven G0863 (FutPasInd) unto men G0444: but G1161 the blasphemy G0988 [against] the [Holy] Ghost G4151 shall G0863 not G3756 be forgiven G0863 (FutPasInd) unto men G0444.
012:032 And G2532 whosoever G3739 G0302 speaketh G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) a word G3056 against G2596 the Son G5207 of man G0444, it shall be forgiven G0863 (FutPasInd) him G0846: but G3739 whosoever G1161 G0302 speaketh G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) against G2596 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, it shall G0863 not G3756 be forgiven G0863 (FutPasInd) him G0846, neither G3777 in G1722 this G5129 world G0165, neither G3777 in G1722 the [world] to come G3195 (PresActPtc).
012:033 Either G2228 make G4160 (AorActImpr) the tree G1186 good G2570, and G2532 his G0846 fruit G2590 good G2570; or else G2228 make G4160 (AorActImpr) the tree G1186 corrupt G4550, and G2532 his G0846 fruit G2590 corrupt G4550: for G1063 the tree G1186 is known G1097 (PresPasInd) by G1537 [his] fruit G2590.
012:034 O generation G1081 of vipers G2191, how G4459 can ye G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd), being G5607 (PresPtc) evil G4190, speak G2980 (PresActInf) good things G0018? for G1063 out of G1537 the abundance G4051 of the heart G2588 the mouth G4750 speaketh G2980 (PresActInd).
012:035 A good G0018 man G0444 out of G1537 the good G0018 treasure G2344 of the heart G2588 bringeth forth G1544 (PresActInd) good things G0018: and G2532 an evil G4190 man G0444 out of G1537 the evil G4190 treasure G2344 bringeth forth G1544 (PresActInd) evil things G4190.
012:036 But G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 every G3956 idle G0692 word G4487 that G3739 G1437 men G0444 shall speak G2980 (AorActSubj), they shall give G0591 (FutActInd) account G3056 thereof G4012 G0846 in G1722 the day G2250 of judgment G2920.
012:037 For G1063 by G1537 thy G4675 words G3056 thou shalt be justified G1344 (FutPasInd), and G2532 by G1537 thy G4675 words G3056 thou shalt be condemned G2613 (FutPasInd).
012:038 Then G5119 certain G5100 of the scribes G1122 and G2532 of the Pharisees G5330 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, we would G2309 (PresActInd) see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) a sign G4592 from G0575 thee G4675.
012:039 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, An evil G4190 and G2532 adulterous G3428 generation G1074 seeketh after G1934 (PresActInd) a sign G4592; and G2532 there shall no G3756 sign G4592 be given G1325 (FutPasInd) to it G0846, but G1508 the sign G4592 of the prophet G4396 Jonas G2495:
012:040 For G1063 as G5618 Jonas G2495 was G2258 (ImpfInd) three G5140 days G2250 and G2532 three G5140 nights G3571 in G1722 the whale’s G2785 belly G2836; so G3779 shall the Son G5207 of man G0444 be G2071 (FutInd) three G5140 days G2250 and G2532 three G5140 nights G3571 in G1722 the heart G2588 of the earth G1093.
012:041 The men G0435 of Nineveh G3536 shall rise G0450 (FutMidInd) in G1722 judgment G2920 with G3326 this G5026 generation G1074, and G2532 shall condemn G2632 (FutActInd) it G0846: because G3754 they repented G3340 (AorActInd) at G1519 the preaching G2782 of Jonas G2495; and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a greater than G4119 Jonas G2495 [is] here G5602.
012:042 The queen G0938 of the south G3558 shall rise up G1453 (FutPasInd) in G1722 the judgment G2920 with G3326 this G5026 generation G1074, and G2532 shall condemn G2632 (FutActInd) it G0846: for G3754 she came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) from G1537 the uttermost parts G4009 of the earth G1093 to hear G0191 (AorActInf) the wisdom G4678 of Solomon G4672; and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a greater than G4119 Solomon G4672 [is] here G5602.
012:043 G1161 When G3752 the unclean G0169 spirit G4151 is gone G1831 (Aor2ActSubj) out of G0575 a man G0444, he walketh G1330 (PresMidPasDepInd) through G1223 dry G0504 places G5117, seeking G2212 (PresActPtc) rest G0372, and G2532 findeth G2147 (PresActInd) none G3756.
012:044 Then G5119 he saith G3004 (PresActInd), I will return G1994 (FutActInd) into G1519 my G3450 house G3624 from whence G3606 I came out G1831 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 when he is come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), he findeth G2147 (PresActInd) [it] empty G4980 (PresActPtc), swept G4563 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 garnished G2885 (PerfPasPtc).
012:045 Then G5119 goeth he G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 taketh G3880 (PresActInd) with G3326 himself G1438 seven G2033 other G2087 spirits G4151 more wicked G4191 than himself G1438, and G2532 they enter in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) and dwell G2730 (PresActInd) there G1563: and G2532 the last G2078 [state] of that G1565 man G0444 is G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) worse than G5501 the first G4413. Even so G3779 shall it be G2071 (FutInd) also G2532 unto this G5026 wicked G4190 generation G1074.
012:046 While G2089 he G0846 yet G1161 talked G2980 (PresActPtc) to the people G3793, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), [his] mother G3384 and G2532 his G0846 brethren G0080 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) without G1854, desiring G2212 (PresActPtc) to speak G2980 (AorActInf) with him G0846.
012:047 Then G1161 one G5100 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), thy G4675 mother G3384 and G2532 thy G4675 brethren G0080 stand G2476 (PerfActInd) without G1854, desiring G2212 (PresActPtc) to speak G2980 (AorActInf) with thee G4671.
012:048 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him that told G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, Who G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 mother G3384? and G2532 who G5101 are G1526 (PresInd) my G3450 brethren G0080?
012:049 And G2532 he stretched forth G1614 (AorActPtc) his G0846 hand G5495 toward G1909 his G0846 disciples G3101, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) my G3450 mother G3384 and G2532 my G3450 brethren G0080!
012:050 For G1063 whosoever G3748 G0302 shall do G4160 (AorActSubj) the will G2307 of my G3450 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772, the same G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 brother G0080, and G2532 sister G0079, and G2532 mother G3384.
013:001 ¶  G1161 The same G1722 G1565 day G2250 went G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) Jesus G2424 out of G0575 the house G3614, and sat G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) by G3844 the sea side G2281.
013:002 And G2532 great G4183 multitudes G3793 were gathered together G4863 (AorPasInd) unto G4314 him G0846, so that G5620 he G0846 went G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 a ship G4143, and sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepInf); and G2532 the whole G3956 multitude G3793 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) on G1909 the shore G0123.
013:003 And G2532 he spake G2980 (AorActInd) many things G4183 unto them G0846 in G1722 parables G3850, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a sower G4687 (PresActPtc) went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) to sow G4687 (PresActInf);
013:004 And G2532 when G1722 he G0846 sowed G4687 (PresActInf), some G3739 G3303 [seeds] fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) by G3844 the way side G3598, and G2532 the fowls G4071 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 devoured G2719 them G0846 up G2719 (Aor2ActInd):
013:005 Some G1161 G0243 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 stony places G4075, where G3699 they had G2192 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 much G4183 earth G1093: and G2532 forthwith G2112 they sprung up G1816 (AorActInd), because G1223 they had G2192 (PresActInf) no G3361 deepness G0899 of earth G1093:
013:006 And G1161 when the sun G2246 was up G0393 (AorActPtc), they were scorched G2739 (AorPasInd); and G2532 because G1223 they had G2192 (PresActInf) no G3361 root G4491, they withered away G3583 (AorPasInd).
013:007 And G1161 some G0243 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) among G1909 thorns G0173; and G2532 the thorns G0173 sprung up G0305 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 choked G0638 (AorActInd) them G0846:
013:008 But G1161 other G0243 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) into G1909 good G2570 ground G1093, and G2532 brought forth G1325 (ImpfActInd) fruit G2590, some G3739 G3303 an hundredfold G1540, G1161 some G3739 sixtyfold G1835, G1161 some G3739 thirtyfold G5144.
013:009 Who G3588 hath G2192 (PresActPtc) ears G3775 to hear G0191 (PresActInf), let him hear G0191 (PresActImpr).
013:010 And G2532 the disciples G3101 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Why G1302 speakest thou G2980 (PresActInd) unto them G0846 in G1722 parables G3850?
013:011 He answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Because G3754 it is given G1325 (PerfPasInd) unto you G5213 to know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) the mysteries G3466 of the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772, but G1161 to them G1565 it is G1325 not G3756 given G1325 (PerfPasInd).
013:012 For G1063 whosoever G3748 hath G2192 (PresActInd), to him G0846 shall be given G1325 (FutPasInd), and G2532 he shall have more abundance G4052 (FutPasInd): but G1161 whosoever G3748 hath G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756, from G0575 him G0846 shall be taken away G0142 (FutPasInd) even G2532 that G3739 he hath G2192 (PresActInd).
013:013 Therefore G1223 G5124 speak I G2980 (PresActInd) to them G0846 in G1722 parables G3850: because G3754 they seeing G0991 (PresActPtc) see G0991 (PresActInd) not G3756; and G2532 hearing G0191 (PresActPtc) they hear G0191 (PresActInd) not G3756, neither G3761 do they understand G4920 (PresActInd).
013:014 And G2532 in G1909 them G0846 is fulfilled G0378 (PresPasInd) the prophecy G4394 of Esaias G2268, which G3588 saith G3004 (PresActPtc), By hearing G0189 ye shall hear G0191 (FutActInd), and G2532 shall G4920 not G3364 understand G4920 (Aor2Subj); and G2532 seeing G0991 (PresActPtc) ye shall see G0991 (FutActInd), and G2532 shall G1492 not G3364 perceive G1492 (Aor2ActSubj):
013:015 For G1063 this G5127 people’s G2992 heart G2588 is waxed gross G3975 (AorPasInd), and G2532 [their] ears G3775 are dull G0917 of hearing G0191 (AorActInd), and G2532 their G0846 eyes G3788 they have closed G2576 (AorActInd); lest at any time G3379 they should see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) with [their] eyes G3788, and G2532 hear G0191 (AorActSubj) with [their] ears G3775, and G2532 should understand G4920 (Aor2ActSubj) with [their] heart G2588, and G2532 should be converted G1994 (AorActSubj), and G2532 I should heal G2390 (AorMidDepSubj) them G0846.
013:016 But G1161 blessed G3107 [are] your G5216 eyes G3788, for G3754 they see G0991 (PresActInd): and G2532 your G5216 ears G3775, for G3754 they hear G0191 (PresActInd).
013:017 For G1063 verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 many G4183 prophets G4396 and G2532 righteous G1342 [men] have desired G1937 (AorActInd) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) [those things] which G3739 ye see G0991 (PresActInd), and G2532 have G1492 not G3756 seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) [them]; and G2532 to hear G0191 (AorActInf) [those things] which G3739 ye hear G0191 (PresActInd), and G2532 have G0191 not G3756 heard G0191 (AorActInd) [them].
013:018 Hear G0191 (AorActImpr) ye G5210 therefore G3767 the parable G3850 of the sower G4687 (PresActPtc).
013:019 When any G3956 one heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) the word G3056 of the kingdom G0932, and G2532 understandeth G4920 (PresActPtc) [it] not G3361, then cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) the wicked G4190 [one], and G2532 catcheth away G0726 (PresActInd) that which G3588 was sown G4687 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 his G0846 heart G2588. This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) he which received seed G4687 (Aor2PasPtc) by G3844 the way side G3598.
013:020 But G1161 he that received the seed G4687 (Aor2PasPtc) into G1909 stony places G4075, the same G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) he that heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) the word G3056, and G2532 anon G2117 with G3326 joy G5479 receiveth G2983 (PresActPtc) it G0846;
013:021 Yet G1161 hath he G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 root G4491 in G1722 himself G1438, but G0235 dureth G2076 (PresInd) for a while G4340: for G1161 when tribulation G2347 or G2228 persecution G1375 ariseth G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) because G1223 of the word G3056, by and by G2117 he is offended G4624 (PresPasInd).
013:022 He also G1161 that received seed G4687 (Aor2PasPtc) among G1519 the thorns G0173 is G2076 (PresInd) he that G3778 heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) the word G3056; and G2532 the care G3308 of this G5127 world G0165, and G2532 the deceitfulness G0539 of riches G4149, choke G4846 (PresActInd) the word G3056, and G2532 he becometh G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) unfruitful G0175.
013:023 But G1161 he that received seed G4687 (Aor2PasPtc) into G1909 the good G2570 ground G1093 is G2076 (PresInd) he G3778 that heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) the word G3056, and G2532 understandeth G4920 (PresActPtc) [it]; which G3739 also G1211 beareth fruit G2592 (PresActInd), and G2532 bringeth forth G4160 (PresActInd), some G3739 G3303 an hundredfold G1540, G1161 some G3739 sixty G1835, G1161 some G3739 thirty G5144.
013:024 Another G0243 parable G3850 put he forth G3908 (AorActInd) unto them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), The kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is likened G3666 (AorPasInd) unto a man G0444 which sowed G4687 (PresActPtc) G4687 (AorActPtc) good G2570 seed G4690 in G1722 his G0846 field G0068:
013:025 But G1161 while G1722 men G0444 slept G2518 (PresActInf), his G0846 enemy G2190 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 sowed G4687 (AorActInd) tares G2215 among G0303 G3319 the wheat G4621, and G2532 went his way G0565 (Aor2ActInd).
013:026 But G1161 when G3753 the blade G5528 was sprung up G0985 (AorActInd), and G2532 brought forth G4160 (AorActInd) fruit G2590, then G5119 appeared G5316 (Aor2PasDepSubj) the tares G2215 also G2532.
013:027 So G1161 the servants G1401 of the householder G3617 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Sir G2962, didst G4687 not G3780 thou sow G4687 (AorActInd) good G2570 seed G4690 in G1722 thy G4674 field G0068? from whence G4159 then G3767 hath it G2192 (PresActInd) tares G2215?
013:028 G1161 He said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto them G0846, An enemy G2190 G0444 hath done G4160 (AorActInd) this G5124. G1161 The servants G1401 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd) then G3767 that we go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and gather G4816 them G0846 up G4816 (AorActSubj)?
013:029 But G1161 he said G5346 (ImpfInd), Nay G3756; lest G3379 while ye gather up G4816 (PresActPtc) the tares G2215, ye root up G1610 (AorActSubj) also the wheat G4621 with G0260 them G0846.
013:030 Let G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) both G0297 grow together G4885 (PresPasInf) until G3360 the harvest G2326: and G2532 in G1722 the time G2540 of harvest G2326 I will say G2046 (FutActInd) to the reapers G2327, Gather ye together G4816 (AorActImpr) first G4412 the tares G2215, and G2532 bind G1210 (AorActImpr) them G0846 in G1519 bundles G1197 to G4314 burn G2618 (AorActInf) them G0846: but G1161 gather G4863 (Aor2ActImpr) the wheat G4621 into G1519 my G3450 barn G0596.
013:031 Another G0243 parable G3850 put he forth G3908 (AorActInd) unto them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), The kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 to a grain G2848 of mustard seed G4615, which G3739 a man G0444 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc), and sowed G4687 (AorActInd) in G1722 his G0846 field G0068:
013:032 Which G3739 indeed G3303 is G2076 (PresInd) the least G3398 of all G3956 seeds G4690: but G1161 when G3752 it is grown G0837 (AorPasSubj), it is G2076 (PresInd) the greatest G3187 among herbs G3001, and G2532 becometh G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) a tree G1186, so that G5620 the birds G4071 of the air G3772 come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) and G2532 lodge G2681 (PresActInf) in G1722 the branches G2798 thereof G0846.
013:033 Another G0243 parable G3850 spake he G2980 (AorActInd) unto them G0846; The kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 unto leaven G2219, which G3739 a woman G1135 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc), and hid G1470 (AorActInd) in G1519 three G5140 measures G4568 of meal G0224, till G2193 the whole G3650 was G3739 leavened G2220 (AorPasInd).
013:034 All G3956 these things G5023 spake G2980 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 unto the multitude G3793 in G1722 parables G3850; and G2532 without G5565 a parable G3850 spake he G2980 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 unto them G0846:
013:035 That G3704 it might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G1223 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I will open G0455 (FutActInd) my G3450 mouth G4750 in G1722 parables G3850; I will utter G2044 (FutMidDepInd) things which have been kept secret G2928 (PerfPasPtc) from G0575 the foundation G2602 of the world G2889.
013:036 Then G5119 Jesus G2424 sent G0863 the multitude G3793 away G0863 (Aor2ActPtc), and went G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the house G3614: and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 came G4334 (AorActInd) unto him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Declare G5419 (AorActImpr) unto us G2254 the parable G3850 of the tares G2215 of the field G0068.
013:037 He answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, He that soweth G4687 (PresActPtc) the good G2570 seed G4690 is G2076 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444;
013:038 G1161 The field G0068 is G2076 (PresInd) the world G2889; G1161 the good G2570 seed G4690 are G3778 G1526 (PresInd) the children G5207 of the kingdom G0932; but G1161 the tares G2215 are G1526 (PresInd) the children G5207 of the wicked G4190 [one];
013:039 G1161 The enemy G2190 that sowed G4687 (AorActPtc) them G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) the devil G1228; G1161 the harvest G2326 is G2076 (PresInd) the end G4930 of the world G0165; and G1161 the reapers G2327 are G1526 (PresInd) the angels G0032.
013:040 As G5618 therefore G3767 the tares G2215 are gathered G4816 (PresPasInd) and G2532 burned G2618 (PresPasInd) in the fire G4442; so G3779 shall it be G2071 (FutInd) in G1722 the end G4930 of this G5127 world G0165.
013:041 The Son G5207 of man G0444 shall send forth G0649 (FutActInd) his G0846 angels G0032, and G2532 they shall gather G4816 (FutActInd) out of G1537 his G0846 kingdom G0932 all things G3956 that offend G4625, and G2532 them which do G4160 (PresActPtc) iniquity G0458;
013:042 And G2532 shall cast G0906 (FutActInd) them G0846 into G1519 a furnace G2575 of fire G4442: there G1563 shall be G2071 (FutInd) wailing G2805 and G2532 gnashing G1030 of teeth G3599.
013:043 Then G5119 shall the righteous G1342 shine forth G1584 (FutActInd) as G5613 the sun G2246 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of their G0846 Father G3962. Who G3588 hath G2192 (PresActPtc) ears G3775 to hear G0191 (PresActInf), let him hear G0191 (PresActImpr).
013:044 Again G3825, the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 unto treasure G2344 hid G2928 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 a field G0068; the which G3739 when a man G0444 hath found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc), he hideth G2928 (AorActInd), and G2532 for G0575 joy G5479 thereof G0846 goeth G5217 (PresActInd) and G2532 selleth G4453 (PresActInd) all G3956 that G3745 he hath G2192 (PresActInd), and G2532 buyeth G0059 (PresActInd) that G1565 field G0068.
013:045 Again G3825, the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 unto a merchant G1713 man G0444, seeking G2212 (PresActPtc) goodly G2570 pearls G3135:
013:046 Who G3739, when he had found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) one G1520 pearl G3135 of great price G4186, went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and sold G4097 (PerfActInd) all G3956 that G3745 he had G2192 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 bought G0059 (AorActInd) it G0846.
013:047 Again G3825, the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 unto a net G4522, that was cast G0906 (AorPasPtc) into G1519 the sea G2281, and G2532 gathered G4863 (Aor2ActPtc) of G1537 every G3956 kind G1085:
013:048 Which G3739, when G3753 it was full G4137 (AorPasInd), they drew G0307 (AorActPtc) to G1909 shore G0123, and G2532 sat down G2523 (AorActPtc), and gathered G4816 (AorActInd) the good G2570 into G1519 vessels G0030, but G1161 cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) the bad G4550 away G1854.
013:049 So G3779 shall it be G2071 (FutInd) at G1722 the end G4930 of the world G0165: the angels G0032 shall come forth G1831 (FutMidDepInd), and G2532 sever G0873 (FutActInd) the wicked G4190 from G1537 among G3319 the just G1342,
013:050 And G2532 shall cast G0906 (FutActInd) them G0846 into G1519 the furnace G2575 of fire G4442: there G1563 shall be G2071 (FutInd) wailing G2805 and G2532 gnashing G1030 of teeth G3599.
013:051 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Have ye understood G4920 (AorActInd) all G3956 these G5023 things G3956? They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Yea G3483, Lord G2962.
013:052 Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) he unto them G0846, Therefore G1223 G5124 every G3956 scribe G1122 [which is] instructed G3100 (AorPasPtc) unto G1519 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 unto a man G0444 [that is] an householder G3617, which G3748 bringeth forth G1544 (PresActInd) out of G1537 his G0846 treasure G2344 [things] new G2537 and G2532 old G3820.
013:053 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), [that] when G3753 Jesus G2424 had finished G5055 (AorActInd) these G5025 parables G3850, he departed G3332 (AorActInd) thence G1564.
013:054 And G2532 when he was come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 his own G0846 country G3968, he taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 in G1722 their G0846 synagogue G4864, insomuch that G5620 they G0846 were astonished G1605 (PresPasInf), and G2532 said G3004 (PresActInf), Whence G4159 hath this [man] G5129 this G3778 wisdom G4678, and G2532 [these] mighty works G1411?
013:055 Is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 this G3778 the carpenter’s G5045 son G5207? is G3004 not G3780 his G0846 mother G3384 called G3004 (PresPasInd) Mary G3137? and G2532 his G0846 brethren G0080, James G2385, and G2532 Joses G2500, and G2532 Simon G4613, and G2532 Judas G2455?
013:056 And G2532 his G0846 sisters G0079, are they G1526 (PresInd) not G3780 all G3956 with G4314 us G2248? Whence G4159 then G3767 hath this [man] G5129 all G3956 these things G5023?
013:057 And G2532 they were offended G4624 (ImpfPasInd) in G1722 him G0846. But G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, A prophet G4396 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 without honour G0820, save G1508 in G1722 his own G0846 country G3968, and G2532 in G1722 his own G0846 house G3614.
013:058 And G2532 he did G4160 (AorActInd) not G3756 many G4183 mighty works G1411 there G1563 because G1223 of their G0846 unbelief G0570.
014:001 ¶  At G1722 that G1565 time G2540 Herod G2264 the tetrarch G5076 heard G0191 (AorActInd) of the fame G0189 of Jesus G2424,
014:002 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto his G0846 servants G3816, This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) John G2491 the Baptist G0910; he G0846 is risen G1453 (AorPasInd) from G0575 the dead G3498; and G2532 therefore G1223 G5124 mighty works G1411 do shew forth themselves G1754 (PresActInd) in G1722 him G0846.
014:003 For G1063 Herod G2264 had laid hold G2902 (AorActPtc) on John G2491, and bound G1210 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 put G5087 (Aor2MidInd) [him] in G1722 prison G5438 for G1223 Herodias’ G2266 sake G1223, his G0846 brother G0080 Philip’s G5376 wife G1135.
014:004 For G1063 John G2491 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846, It is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) for thee G4671 to have G2192 (PresActInf) her G0846.
014:005 And G2532 when he would G2309 (PresActPtc) have put G0615 him G0846 to death G0615 (AorActInf), he feared G5399 (AorPasDepInd) the multitude G3793, because G3754 they counted G2192 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 as G5613 a prophet G4396.
014:006 But G1161 when Herod’s G2264 birthday G1077 was kept G0071 (PresPasPtc), the daughter G2364 of Herodias G2266 danced G3738 (AorMidDepInd) before them G1722 G3319, and G2532 pleased G0700 (AorActInd) Herod G2264.
014:007 Whereupon G3606 he promised G3670 (AorActInd) with G3326 an oath G3727 to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) her G0846 whatsoever G3739 G1437 she would ask G0154 (AorMidSubj).
014:008 And G1161 she, being before instructed G4264 (AorPasPtc) of G5259 her G0846 mother G3384, said G5346 (PresInd), Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427 here G5602 John G2491 Baptist’s G0910 head G2776 in G1909 a charger G4094.
014:009 And G2532 the king G0935 was sorry G3076 (AorPasInd): nevertheless for G1161 G1223 the oath’s sake G3727, and G2532 them which sat with him at meat G4873 (PresMidPasDepPtc), he commanded G2753 (AorActInd) [it] to be given G1325 (AorPasInf) [her].
014:010 And G2532 he sent G3992 (AorActPtc), and beheaded G0607 (AorActInd) John G2491 in G1722 the prison G5438.
014:011 And G2532 his G0846 head G2776 was brought G5342 (AorPasInd) in G1909 a charger G4094, and G2532 given G1325 (AorPasInd) to the damsel G2877: and G2532 she brought G5342 (AorActInd) [it] to her G0846 mother G3384.
014:012 And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), and took up G0142 (AorActInd) the body G4983, and G2532 buried G2290 (AorActInd) it G0846, and G2532 went G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and told G0518 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424.
014:013 When G2532 Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [of it], he departed G0402 (AorActInd) thence G1564 by G1722 ship G4143 into G1519 a desert G2048 place G5117 apart G2596 G2398: and G2532 when the people G3793 had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [thereof], they followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846 on foot G3979 out of G0575 the cities G4172.
014:014 And G2532 Jesus G2424 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a great G4183 multitude G3793, and G2532 was moved with compassion G4697 (AorPasDepInd) toward G1909 them G0846, and G2532 he healed G2323 (AorActInd) their G0846 sick G0732.
014:015 And G1161 when it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) evening G3798, his G0846 disciples G3101 came G4334 (AorActInd) to him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This is G2076 (PresInd) a desert G2048 place G5117, and G2532 the time G5610 is now G2235 past G3928 (Aor2ActInd); send G0630 the multitude G3793 away G0630 (AorActImpr), that G2443 they may go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the villages G2968, and buy G0059 (AorActSubj) themselves G1438 victuals G1033.
014:016 But G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, They need G5532 not G3756 depart G0565 (Aor2ActInf) G2192 (PresActInd); give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) ye G5210 them G0846 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf).
014:017 And G1161 they say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, We have G2192 (PresActInd) here G5602 but G3756 G1508 five G4002 loaves G0740, and G2532 two G1417 fishes G2486.
014:018 G1161 He said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Bring G5342 (PresActImpr) them G0846 hither G5602 to me G3427.
014:019 And G2532 he commanded G2753 (AorActPtc) the multitude G3793 to sit down G0347 (AorPasInf) on G1909 the grass G5528, and G2532 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the five G4002 loaves G0740, and G2532 the two G1417 fishes G2486, and looking up G0308 (AorActPtc) to G1519 heaven G3772, he blessed G2127 (AorActInd), and G2532 brake G2806 (AorActPtc), and gave G1325 (AorActInd) the loaves G0740 to [his] disciples G3101, and G1161 the disciples G3101 to the multitude G3793.
014:020 And G2532 they did G5315 all G3956 eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 were filled G5526 (AorPasInd): and G2532 they took up G0142 (AorActInd) of the fragments G2801 that remained G4052 (PresActPtc) twelve G1427 baskets G2894 full G4134.
014:021 And G1161 they that had eaten G2068 (PresActPtc) were G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5616 five thousand G4000 men G0435, beside G5565 women G1135 and G2532 children G3813.
014:022 And G2532 straightway G2112 Jesus G2424 constrained G0315 (AorActInd) his G0846 disciples G3101 to get G1684 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 a ship G4143, and G2532 to go before G4254 (PresActInf) him G0846 unto G1519 the other side G4008, while G2193 G3739 he sent G0630 the multitudes G3793 away G0630 (AorActSubj).
014:023 And G2532 when he had sent G0630 the multitudes G3793 away G0630 (AorActPtc), he went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a mountain G3735 apart G2596 G2398 to pray G4336 (AorMidDepInf): and G1161 when the evening G3798 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), he was G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563 alone G3441.
014:024 But G1161 the ship G4143 was G2258 (ImpfInd) now G2235 in the midst G3319 of the sea G2281, tossed G0928 (PresPasPtc) with G5259 waves G2949: for G1063 the wind G0417 was G2258 (ImpfInd) contrary G1727.
014:025 And G1161 in the fourth G5067 watch G5438 of the night G3571 Jesus G2424 went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, walking G4043 (PresActPtc) on G1909 the sea G2281.
014:026 And G2532 when the disciples G3101 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 walking G4043 (PresActPtc) on G1909 the sea G2281, they were troubled G5015 (AorPasInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc) G3754, It is G2076 (PresInd) a spirit G5326; and G2532 they cried out G2896 (AorActInd) for G0575 fear G5401.
014:027 But G1161 straightway G2112 Jesus G2424 spake G2980 (AorActInd) unto them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Be of good cheer G2293 (PresActImpr); it is G1510 (PresInd) I G1473; be G5399 not G3361 afraid G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr).
014:028 And G1161 Peter G4074 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) him G0846 and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, if G1487 it be G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771, bid G2753 (AorActImpr) me G3165 come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) unto G4314 thee G4571 on G1909 the water G5204.
014:029 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Come G2064 (Aor2ActImpr). And G2532 when Peter G4074 was come down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G0575 the ship G4143, he walked G4043 (AorActInd) on G1909 the water G5204, to go G2064 (Aor2ActInf) to G4314 Jesus G2424.
014:030 But G1161 when he saw G0991 (PresActPtc) the wind G0417 boisterous G2478, he was afraid G5399 (AorPasDepInd); and G2532 beginning G0756 (AorMidPtc) to sink G2670 (PresPasInf), he cried G2896 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, save G4982 (AorActImpr) me G3165.
014:031 And G1161 immediately G2112 Jesus G2424 stretched forth G1614 (AorActPtc) [his] hand G5495, and caught G1949 (Aor2MidDepInd) him G0846, and G2532 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, O thou of little faith G3640, wherefore G1519 G5101 didst thou doubt G1365 (AorActInd)?
014:032 And G2532 when they G0846 were come G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the ship G4143, the wind G0417 ceased G2869 (AorActInd).
014:033 Then G1161 they that were in G1722 the ship G4143 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Of a truth G0230 thou art G1488 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316.
014:034 And G2532 when they were gone over G1276 (AorActPtc), they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the land G1093 of Gennesaret G1082.
014:035 And G2532 when the men G0435 of that G1565 place G5117 had knowledge G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) of him G0846, they sent out G0649 (AorActInd) into G1519 all G3650 that G1565 country round about G4066, and G2532 brought G4374 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 all G3956 that were G2192 (PresActPtc) diseased G2560;
014:036 And G2532 besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that G2443 they might G0680 only G3440 touch G0680 (AorMidSubj) the hem G2899 of his G0846 garment G2440: and G2532 as many as G3745 touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) were made perfectly whole G1295 (AorPasInd).
015:001 ¶  Then G5119 came G4334 (PresMidPasDepInd) to Jesus G2424 scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, which were of G0575 Jerusalem G2414, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
015:002 Why G1302 do thy G4675 disciples G3101 transgress G3845 (PresActInd) the tradition G3862 of the elders G4245? for G1063 they wash G3538 (PresMidInd) not G3756 their G0846 hands G5495 when G3752 they eat G2068 (PresActSubj) bread G0740.
015:003 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G1302 do ye G5210 also G2532 transgress G3845 (PresActInd) the commandment G1785 of God G2316 by G1223 your G5216 tradition G3862?
015:004 For G1063 God G2316 commanded G1781 (AorMidDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Honour G5091 (PresActImpr) thy G4675 father G3962 and G2532 mother G3384: and G2532, He that curseth G2551 (PresActPtc) father G3962 or G2228 mother G3384, let him die G5053 (PresActImpr) the death G2288.
015:005 But G1161 ye G5210 say G3004 (PresActInd), Whosoever G3739 G0302 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) to [his] father G3962 or G2228 [his] mother G3384, [It is] a gift G1435, by G1537 whatsoever G3739 G1437 thou mightest be profited G5623 (AorPasSubj) by me G1700;
015:006 And G2532 honour G5091 (AorActSubj) not G3364 his G0846 father G3962 or G2228 his G0846 mother G3384, [he shall be free]. Thus G2532 have ye made G0208 the commandment G1785 of God G2316 of none effect G0208 (AorActInd) by G1223 your G5216 tradition G3862.
015:007 [Ye] hypocrites G5273, well G2573 did G4395 Esaias G2268 prophesy G4395 (AorActInd) of G4012 you G5216, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
015:008 This G3778 people G2992 draweth nigh G1448 (PresActInd) unto me G3427 with their G0846 mouth G4750, and G2532 honoureth G5091 (PresActInd) me G3165 with [their] lips G5491; but G1161 their G0846 heart G2588 is G0568 (PresActInd) far G4206 from G0575 me G1700.
015:009 But G1161 in vain G3155 they do worship G4576 (PresMidPasDepInd) me G3165, teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) [for] doctrines G1319 the commandments G1778 of men G0444.
015:010 And G2532 he called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) the multitude G3793, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Hear G0191 (PresActImpr), and G2532 understand G4920 (PresActImpr):
015:011 Not G3756 that which goeth G1525 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 the mouth G4750 defileth G2840 (PresActInd) a man G0444; but G0235 that which cometh G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 the mouth G4750, this G5124 defileth G2840 (PresActInd) a man G0444.
015:012 Then G5119 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) his G0846 disciples G3101, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Knowest thou G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 the Pharisees G5330 were offended G4624 (AorPasInd), after they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) this saying G3056?
015:013 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Every G3956 plant G5451, which G3739 my G3450 heavenly G3770 Father G3962 hath G5452 not G3756 planted G5452 (AorActInd), shall be rooted up G1610 (FutPasInd).
015:014 Let G0863 them G0846 alone G0863 (Aor2ActImpr): they be G1526 (PresInd) blind G5185 leaders G3595 of the blind G5185. And G1161 if G1437 the blind G5185 lead G3594 (PresActSubj) the blind G5185, both G0297 shall fall G4098 (FutMidPasDepInd) into G1519 the ditch G0999.
015:015 Then G1161 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) Peter G4074 and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Declare G5419 (AorActImpr) unto us G2254 this G5026 parable G3850.
015:016 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Are G2075 (PresInd) ye G5210 also G2532 yet G0188 without understanding G0801?
015:017 Do G3539 not G3768 ye G3539 yet G3768 understand G3539 (PresActInd), that G3754 whatsoever G3956 entereth in G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) at G1519 the mouth G4750 goeth G5562 (PresActInd) into G1519 the belly G2836, and G2532 is cast out G1544 (PresPasInd) into G1519 the draught G0856?
015:018 But G1161 those things which G3588 proceed G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 the mouth G4750 come forth G1831 (PresMidPasDepInd) from G1537 the heart G2588; and they G2548 defile G2840 (PresActInd) the man G0444.
015:019 For G1063 out of G1537 the heart G2588 proceed G1831 (PresMidPasDepInd) evil G4190 thoughts G1261, murders G5408, adulteries G3430, fornications G4202, thefts G2829, false witness G5577, blasphemies G0988:
015:020 These G5023 are G2076 (PresInd) [the things] which G3588 defile G2840 (PresActPtc) a man G0444: but G1161 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) with unwashen G0449 hands G5495 defileth G2840 (PresActInd) not G3756 a man G0444.
015:021 Then G2532 Jesus G2424 went G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) thence G1564, and departed G0402 (AorActInd) into G1519 the coasts G3313 of Tyre G5184 and G2532 Sidon G4605.
015:022 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a woman G1135 of Canaan G5478 came G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G0575 the same G1565 coasts G3725, and cried G2905 (AorActInd) unto him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on me G3165, O Lord G2962, [thou] Son G5207 of David G1138; my G3450 daughter G2364 is grievously G2560 vexed with a devil G1139 (PresMidPasDepInd).
015:023 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) her G0846 not G3756 a word G3056. And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and besought G2065 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Send G0630 her G0846 away G0630 (AorActImpr); for G3754 she crieth G2896 (PresActInd) after G3693 us G2257.
015:024 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I am G0649 not G3756 sent G0649 (Aor2PasDepSubj) but G1508 unto G1519 the lost G0622 (Perf2ActPtc) sheep G4263 of the house G3624 of Israel G2474.
015:025 Then G1161 came she G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and worshipped G4352 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, help G0997 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
015:026 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), It is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 meet G2570 to take G2983 (Aor2ActInf) the children’s G5043 bread G0740, and G2532 to cast G0906 (Aor2ActInf) [it] to dogs G2952.
015:027 And G1161 she said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Truth G3483, Lord G2962: yet G2532 G1063 the dogs G2952 eat G2068 (PresActInd) of G0575 the crumbs G5589 which G3588 fall G4098 (PresActPtc) from G0575 their G0846 masters G2962 ’ table G5132.
015:028 Then G5119 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, O G5599 woman G1135, great G3173 [is] thy G4675 faith G4102: be it G1096 (AorPasDepImpr) unto thee G4671 even as G5613 thou wilt G2309 (PresActInd). And G2532 her G0846 daughter G2364 was made whole G2390 (AorPasInd) from G0575 that very G1565 hour G5610.
015:029 And G2532 Jesus G2424 departed G3327 (Aor2ActPtc) from thence G1564, and came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) nigh unto G3844 the sea G2281 of Galilee G1056; and G2532 went up G0305 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 a mountain G3735, and sat down G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) there G1563.
015:030 And G2532 great G4183 multitudes G3793 came G4334 (AorActInd) unto him G0846, having G2192 (PresActPtc) with G3326 them [those that were] G1438 lame G5560, blind G5185, dumb G2974, maimed G2948, and G2532 many G4183 others G2087, and G2532 cast G4496 them G0846 down G4496 (AorActInd) at G3844 Jesus G2424 ’ feet G4228; and G2532 he healed G2323 (AorActInd) them G0846:
015:031 Insomuch that G5620 the multitude G3793 wondered G2296 (AorActInf), when they saw G0991 (PresActPtc) the dumb G2974 to speak G2980 (PresActPtc), the maimed G2948 to be whole G5199, the lame G5560 to walk G4043 (PresActPtc), and G2532 the blind G5185 to see G0991 (PresActPtc): and G2532 they glorified G1392 (AorActInd) the God G2316 of Israel G2474.
015:032 Then G1161 Jesus G2424 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) his G0846 disciples G3101 [unto him], and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I have compassion G4697 (PresMidPasDepInd) on G1909 the multitude G3793, because G3754 they continue G4357 (PresActInd) with me G3427 now G2235 three G5140 days G2250, and G2532 have G2192 (PresActInd) nothing G3756 G5101 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj): and G2532 I will G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756 send G0630 them G0846 away G0630 (AorActInf) fasting G3523, lest G3379 they faint G1590 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 the way G3598.
015:033 And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Whence G4159 should we G2254 have so much G5118 bread G0740 in G1722 the wilderness G2047, as G5620 to fill G5526 (AorActInf) so great G5118 a multitude G3793?
015:034 And G2532 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, How many G4214 loaves G0740 have ye G2192 (PresActInd)? And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Seven G2033, and G2532 a few G3641 little fishes G2485.
015:035 And G2532 he commanded G2753 (AorActInd) the multitude G3793 to sit down G0377 (Aor2ActInf) on G1909 the ground G1093.
015:036 And G2532 he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the seven G2033 loaves G0740 and G2532 the fishes G2486, and gave thanks G2168 (AorActPtc), and brake G2806 (AorActInd) [them], and G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) to his G0846 disciples G3101, and G1161 the disciples G3101 to the multitude G3793.
015:037 And G2532 they did G5315 all G3956 eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 were filled G5526 (AorPasInd): and G2532 they took up G0142 (AorActInd) of the broken G2801 [meat] that was left G4052 (PresActPtc) seven G2033 baskets G4711 full G4134.
015:038 And G1161 they that did eat G2068 (PresActPtc) were G2258 (ImpfInd) four thousand G5070 men G0435, beside G5565 women G1135 and G2532 children G3813.
015:039 And G2532 he sent away G0630 (AorActPtc) the multitude G3793, and took G1684 (Aor2ActInd) ship G1519 G4143, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the coasts G3725 of Magdala G3093.
016:001 ¶  The Pharisees G5330 also G2532 with the Sadducees G4523 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 tempting G3985 (PresActPtc) desired G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846 that he would shew G1925 (AorActInf) them G0846 a sign G4592 from G1537 heaven G3772.
016:002 G1161 He answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, When it is G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) evening G3798, ye say G3004 (PresActInd), [It will be] fair weather G2105: for G1063 the sky G3772 is red G4449 (PresActInd).
016:003 And G2532 in the morning G4404, [It will be] foul weather G5494 to day G4594: for G1063 the sky G3772 is red G4449 (PresActInd) and lowring G4768 (PresActPtc). O [ye] hypocrites G5273, ye can G1097 (PresActInd) discern G1252 (PresActInf) G3303 the face G4383 of the sky G3772; but G1161 can ye G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 [discern] the signs G4592 of the times G2540?
016:004 A wicked G4190 and G2532 adulterous G3428 generation G1074 seeketh after G1934 (PresActInd) a sign G4592; and G2532 there shall no G3756 sign G4592 be given G1325 (FutPasInd) unto it G0846, but G1508 the sign G4592 of the prophet G4396 Jonas G2495. And G2532 he left G2641 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846, and departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd).
016:005 And G2532 when his G0846 disciples G3101 were come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 the other side G4008, they had forgotten G1950 (Aor2MidDepInd) to take G2983 (Aor2ActInf) bread G0740.
016:006 Then G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Take heed G3708 (PresActImpr) and G2532 beware G4337 (PresActImpr) of G0575 the leaven G2219 of the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 of the Sadducees G4523.
016:007 And G1161 they reasoned G1260 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) among G1722 themselves G1438, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), [It is] because G3754 we have taken G2983 (Aor2ActInd) no G3756 bread G0740.
016:008 [Which] when G1161 Jesus G2424 perceived G1097 (Aor2ActPtc), he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, O ye of little faith G3640, why G5101 reason ye G1260 (PresMidPasDepInd) among G1722 yourselves G1438, because G3754 ye have brought G2983 (Aor2ActInd) no G3756 bread G0740?
016:009 Do ye G3539 not yet G3768 understand G3539 (PresActInd), neither G3761 remember G3421 (PresActInd) the five G4002 loaves G0740 of the five thousand G4000, and G2532 how many G4214 baskets G2894 ye took up G2983 (Aor2ActInd)?
016:010 Neither G3761 the seven G2033 loaves G0740 of the four thousand G5070, and G2532 how many G4214 baskets G4711 ye took up G2983 (Aor2ActInd)?
016:011 How G4459 is it that G3754 ye do G3539 not G3756 understand G3539 (PresActInd) that I spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) [it] not G3756 to you G5213 concerning G4012 bread G0740, that ye should beware G4337 (PresActInf) of G0575 the leaven G2219 of the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 of the Sadducees G4523?
016:012 Then G5119 understood they G4920 (AorActInd) how that G3754 he bade G2036 (Aor2ActInd) [them] not G3756 beware G4337 (PresActInf) of G0575 the leaven G2219 of bread G0740, but G0235 of G0575 the doctrine G1322 of the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 of the Sadducees G4523.
016:013 When G1161 Jesus G2424 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the coasts G3313 of Caesarea G2542 Philippi G5376, he asked G2065 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 disciples G3101, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Whom G5101 do men G0444 say G3004 (PresActInd) that I G3165 the Son G5207 of man G0444 am G1511 (PresInf)?
016:014 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Some [say that thou art] G3303 John G2491 the Baptist G0910: G1161 some G0243, Elias G2243; and G1161 others G2087, Jeremias G2408, or G2228 one G1520 of the prophets G4396.
016:015 He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, But G1161 whom G5101 say G3004 (PresActInd) ye G5210 that I G3165 am G1511 (PresInf)?
016:016 And G1161 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) the Christ G5547, the Son G5207 of the living G2198 (PresActPtc) God G2316.
016:017 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Blessed G3107 art thou G1488 (PresInd), Simon G4613 Barjona G0920: for G3754 flesh G4561 and G2532 blood G0129 hath G0601 not G3756 revealed G0601 (AorActInd) [it] unto thee G4671, but G0235 my G3450 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772.
016:018 And G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) also G2504 unto thee G4671, That G3754 thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) Peter G4074, and G2532 upon G1909 this G5026 rock G4073 I will build G3618 (FutActInd) my G3450 church G1577; and G2532 the gates G4439 of hell G0086 shall G2729 not G3756 prevail against G2729 (FutActInd) it G0846.
016:019 And G2532 I will give G1325 (FutActInd) unto thee G4671 the keys G2807 of the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772: and G2532 whatsoever G3739 G1437 thou shalt bind G1210 (AorActSubj) on G1909 earth G1093 shall be G2071 (FutInd) bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 heaven G3772: and G2532 whatsoever G3739 G1437 thou shalt loose G3089 (AorActSubj) on G1909 earth G1093 shall be G2071 (FutInd) loosed G3089 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 heaven G3772.
016:020 Then G5119 charged he G1291 (AorMidInd) his G0846 disciples G3101 that G2443 they should tell G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) no man G3367 that G3754 he G0846 was G2076 (PresInd) Jesus G2424 the Christ G5547.
016:021 From G0575 that time forth G5119 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) Jesus G2424 to shew G1166 (PresActInf) unto his G0846 disciples G3101, how that G3754 he G0846 must G1163 (PresInd) go G0565 (Aor2ActInf) unto G1519 Jerusalem G2414, and G2532 suffer G3958 (Aor2ActInf) many things G4183 of G0575 the elders G4245 and G2532 chief priests G0749 and G2532 scribes G1122, and G2532 be killed G0615 (AorPasInf), and G2532 be raised again G1453 (AorPasInf) the third G5154 day G2250.
016:022 Then G2532 Peter G4074 took G4355 (Aor2MidPtc) him G0846, and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to rebuke G2008 (PresActInf) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Be it far G2436 from thee G4671, Lord G2962: this G5124 shall G2071 not G3364 be G2071 (FutInd) unto thee G4671.
016:023 But G1161 he turned G4762 (Aor2PasPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto Peter G4074, Get thee G5217 (PresActImpr) behind G3694 me G3450, Satan G4567: thou G1488 (PresInd) art G3754 an offence G4625 unto me G3450: for thou savourest G5426 (PresActInd) not G3756 the things G3588 that be of God G2316, but G0235 those that be of men G0444.
016:024 Then G5119 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto his G0846 disciples G3101, If any G1536 [man] will G2309 (PresActInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) after G3694 me G3450, let him deny G0533 (AorMidDepImpr) himself G1438, and G2532 take up G0142 (AorActImpr) his G0846 cross G4716, and G2532 follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
016:025 For G1063 whosoever G3739 G0302 will G2309 (PresActSubj) save G4982 (AorActInf) his G0846 life G5590 shall lose G0622 (FutActInd) it G0846: and G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 will lose G0622 (AorActSubj) his G0846 life G5590 for G1752 my G1700 sake G1752 shall find G2147 (FutActInd) it G0846.
016:026 For G1063 what G5101 is a man G0444 profited G5623 (PresPasInd), if G1437 he shall gain G2770 (AorActSubj) the whole G3650 world G2889, and G1161 lose G2210 (AorPasSubj) his own G0846 soul G5590? or G2228 what G5101 shall a man G0444 give G1325 (FutActInd) in exchange G0465 for his G0846 soul G5590?
016:027 For G1063 the Son G5207 of man G0444 shall G3195 (PresActInd) come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInf) in G1722 the glory G1391 of his G0846 Father G3962 with G3326 his G0846 angels G0032; and G2532 then G5119 he shall reward G0591 (FutActInd) every man G1538 according G2596 to his G0846 works G4234.
016:028 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, There be G1526 (PresInd) some G5100 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) here G5602, which G3748 shall G1089 not G3364 taste G1089 (AorMidDepSubj) of death G2288, till G0302 G2193 they see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) the Son G5207 of man G0444 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 his G0846 kingdom G0932.
017:001 ¶  And G2532 after G3326 six G1803 days G2250 Jesus G2424 taketh G3880 (PresActInd) Peter G4074 G2532, James G2385, and G2532 John G2491 his G0846 brother G0080, and G2532 bringeth G0399 them G0846 up G0399 (PresActInd) into G1519 an high G5308 mountain G3735 apart G2596 G2398,
017:002 And G2532 was transfigured G3339 (AorPasInd) before G1715 them G0846: and G2532 his G0846 face G4383 did shine G2989 (AorActInd) as G5613 the sun G2246, and G1161 his G0846 raiment G2440 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) white G3022 as G5613 the light G5457.
017:003 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) unto them G0846 Moses G3475 and G2532 Elias G2243 talking G4814 (PresActPtc) with G3326 him G0846.
017:004 Then G1161 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) Peter G4074, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto Jesus G2424, Lord G2962, it is G2076 (PresInd) good G2570 for us G2248 to be G1511 (PresInf) here G5602: if G1487 thou wilt G2309 (PresActInd), let us make G4160 (AorActSubj) here G5602 three G5140 tabernacles G4633; one G3391 for thee G4671, and G2532 one G3391 for Moses G3475, and G2532 one G3391 for Elias G2243.
017:005 While he G0846 yet G2089 spake G2980 (PresActPtc), behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a bright G5460 cloud G3507 overshadowed G1982 (AorActInd) them G0846: and G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a voice G5456 out of G1537 the cloud G3507, which said G3004 (PresActPtc), This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 beloved G0027 Son G5207, in G1722 whom G3739 I am well pleased G2106 (AorActInd); hear ye G0191 (PresActImpr) him G0846.
017:006 And G2532 when the disciples G3101 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], they fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 their G0846 face G4383, and G2532 were sore G4970 afraid G5399 (AorPasDepInd).
017:007 And G2532 Jesus G2424 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Arise G1453 (AorPasImpr), and G2532 be G5399 not G3361 afraid G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr).
017:008 And G1161 when they had lifted up G1869 (AorActPtc) their G0846 eyes G3788, they saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) no man G3762, save G1508 Jesus G2424 only G3441.
017:009 And G2532 as they G0846 came down G2597 (PresActPtc) from G0575 the mountain G3735, Jesus G2424 charged G1781 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Tell G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) the vision G3705 to no man G3367, until G2193 G3739 the Son G5207 of man G0444 be risen again G0450 (Aor2ActSubj) from G1537 the dead G3498.
017:010 And G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Why G5101 then G3767 say G3004 (PresActInd) the scribes G1122 that G3754 Elias G2243 must G1163 (PresInd) first G4412 come G2064 (Aor2ActInf)?
017:011 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Elias G2243 truly G3303 shall first G4412 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 restore G0600 (FutActInd) all things G3956.
017:012 But G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 Elias G2243 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) already G2235, and G2532 they knew G1921 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 not G3756, but G0235 have done G4160 (AorActInd) unto G1722 him G0846 whatsoever G3745 they listed G2309 (AorActInd). Likewise G3779 shall G3195 (PresActInd) also G2532 the Son G5207 of man G0444 suffer G3958 (PresActInf) of G5259 them G0846.
017:013 Then G5119 the disciples G3101 understood G4920 (AorActInd) that G3754 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846 of G4012 John G2491 the Baptist G0910.
017:014 And G2532 when they G0846 were come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G4314 the multitude G3793, there came G4334 (Aor2ActInd) to him G0846 a [certain] man G0444, kneeling down G1120 (PresActPtc) to him G0846, and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
017:015 Lord G2962, have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on my G3450 son G5207: for G3754 he is lunatick G4583 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 sore G2560 vexed G3958 (PresActInd): for G1063 ofttimes G4178 he falleth G4098 (PresActInd) into G1519 the fire G4442, and G2532 oft G4178 into G1519 the water G5204.
017:016 And G2532 I brought G4374 (AorActInd) him G0846 to thy G4675 disciples G3101, and G2532 they could G1410 (AorPasDepInd) not G3756 cure G2323 (AorActInf) him G0846.
017:017 Then G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), O G5599 faithless G0571 and G2532 perverse G1294 (PerfPasPtc) generation G1074, how long G2193 G4219 shall I be G2071 (FutInd) with G3326 you G5216? how long G2193 G4219 shall I suffer G0430 (FutMidDepInd) you G5216? bring G5342 (PresActImpr) him G0846 hither G5602 to me G3427.
017:018 And G2532 Jesus G2424 rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) the devil G1140; and G2532 he G0846 departed G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G0575 him G0846: and G2532 the child G3816 was cured G2323 (AorPasInd) from G0575 that very G1565 hour G5610.
017:019 Then G5119 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) the disciples G3101 to Jesus G2424 apart G2596 G2398, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Why G1302 could G1410 (AorPasDepInd) not G3756 we G2249 cast G1544 him G0846 out G1544 (Aor2ActInf)?
017:020 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Because G1223 of your G5216 unbelief G0570: for G1063 verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, If G1437 ye have G2192 (PresActSubj) faith G4102 as G5613 a grain G2848 of mustard seed G4615, ye shall say G2046 (FutActInd) unto this G5129 mountain G3735, Remove G3327 (Aor2ActImpr) hence G1782 to yonder place G1563; and G2532 it shall remove G3327 (FutMidDepInd); and G2532 nothing G3762 shall be impossible G0101 (FutActInd) unto you G5213.
017:021 Howbeit G1161 this G5124 kind G1085 goeth G1607 not G3756 out G1607 (PresMidPasDepInd) but G1508 by G1722 prayer G4335 and G2532 fasting G3521.
017:022 And G1161 while they G0846 abode G0390 (PresPasPtc) in G1722 Galilee G1056, Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, The Son G5207 of man G0444 shall be G3195 (PresActInd) betrayed G3860 (PresPasInf) into G1519 the hands G5495 of men G0444:
017:023 And G2532 they shall kill G0615 (FutActInd) him G0846, and G2532 the third G5154 day G2250 he shall be raised again G1453 (FutPasInd). And G2532 they were exceeding G4970 sorry G3076 (AorPasInd).
017:024 And G1161 when they G0846 were come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 Capernaum G2584, they that received G2983 (PresActPtc) tribute G1323 [money] came G4334 (AorActInd) to Peter G4074, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Doth G5055 not G3756 your G5216 master G1320 pay G5055 (PresActInd) tribute G1323?
017:025 He saith G3004 (PresActInd), Yes G3483. And G2532 when G3753 he was come G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the house G3614, Jesus G2424 prevented G4399 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 thinkest G1380 (PresActInd) thou G4671, Simon G4613? of G0575 whom G5101 do G2983 the kings G0935 of the earth G1093 take G2983 (PresActInd) custom G5056 or G2228 tribute G2778? of G0575 their own G0846 children G5207, or G2228 of G0575 strangers G0245?
017:026 Peter G4074 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Of G0575 strangers G0245. Jesus G2424 saith G5346 (ImpfInd) unto him G0846, Then G0686 are G1526 (PresInd) the children G5207 free G1658.
017:027 Notwithstanding G1161, lest G3363 we should offend G4624 (AorActSubj) them G0846, go thou G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) to G1519 the sea G2281, and cast G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) an hook G0044, and G2532 take up G0142 (AorActImpr) the fish G2486 that first G4412 cometh up G0305 (Aor2ActPtc); and G2532 when thou hast opened G0455 (AorActPtc) his G0846 mouth G4750, thou shalt find G2147 (FutActInd) a piece of money G4715: that G1565 take G2983 (Aor2ActPtc), and give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) unto them G0846 for G0473 me G1700 and G2532 thee G4675.
018:001 ¶  At G1722 the same G1565 time G5610 came G4334 (AorActInd) the disciples G3101 unto Jesus G2424, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Who G5101 G0686 is G2076 (PresInd) the greatest G3187 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772?
018:002 And G2532 Jesus G2424 called G4341 a little child G3813 unto him G4341 (AorMidDepPtc), and set G2476 (AorActInd) him G0846 in G1722 the midst G3319 of them G0846,
018:003 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Except G3362 ye be converted G4762 (Aor2PasSubj), and G2532 become G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) as G5613 little children G3813, ye shall G1525 not G3364 enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772.
018:004 Whosoever G3748 therefore G3767 shall humble G5013 (AorActSubj) himself G1438 as G5613 this G5124 little child G3813, the same G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) greatest G3187 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772.
018:005 And G2532 whoso G3739 G1437 shall receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) one G1520 such G5108 little child G3813 in G1909 my G3450 name G3686 receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepInd) me G1691.
018:006 But G1161 whoso G3739 G0302 shall offend G4624 (AorActSubj) one G1520 of these G5130 little ones G3398 which G3588 believe G4100 (PresActPtc) in G1519 me G1691, it were better G4851 (PresActInd) for him G0846 that G2443 a millstone G3458 G3684 were hanged G2910 (AorPasSubj) about G1909 his G0846 neck G5137, and G2532 [that] he were drowned G2670 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 the depth G3989 of the sea G2281.
018:007 Woe G3759 unto the world G2889 because of G0575 offences G4625! for G1063 it must needs G0318 be G2076 (PresInd) that offences G4625 come G2064 (Aor2ActInf); but G4133 woe G3759 to that man G0444 by G1565 whom G1223 G3739 the offence G4625 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd)!
018:008 Wherefore G1161 if G1487 thy G4675 hand G5495 or G2228 thy G4675 foot G4228 offend thee G4624 (PresActInd), cut G1581 them G0846 off G1581 (AorActImpr), and G2532 cast G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) [them] from G0575 thee G4571 G4675: it is G2076 (PresInd) better G2570 for thee G4671 to enter into G1525 (Aor2ActInf) G1519 life G2222 halt G5560 or G2228 maimed G2948, rather than G2228 having G2192 (PresActPtc) two G1417 hands G5495 or G2228 two G1417 feet G4228 to be cast G0906 (AorPasInf) into G1519 everlasting G0166 fire G4442.
018:009 And G2532 if G1487 thine G4675 eye G3788 offend G4624 (PresActInd) thee G4571, pluck G1807 it G0846 out G1807 (Aor2ActImpr), and G2532 cast G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) [it] from G0575 thee G4675: it is G2076 (PresInd) better G2570 for thee G4671 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 life G2222 with one eye G3442, rather than G2228 having G2192 (PresActPtc) two G1417 eyes G3788 to be cast G0906 (AorPasInf) into G1519 hell G1067 fire G4442.
018:010 Take heed G3708 (PresActImpr) that ye despise G2706 (AorActSubj) not G3361 one G1520 of these G5130 little ones G3398; for G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 in G1722 heaven G3772 their G0846 angels G0032 do always G1223 G3956 behold G0991 (PresActInd) the face G4383 of my G3450 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772.
018:011 For G1063 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to save G4982 (AorActInf) that which G3588 was lost G0622 (Perf2ActPtc).
018:012 How G5101 think G1380 (PresActInd) ye G5213? if G1437 G5100 a man G0444 have G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) an hundred G1540 sheep G4263, and G2532 one G1520 of G1537 them G0846 be gone astray G4105 (AorPasSubj), doth he G0863 not G3780 leave G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) the ninety and nine G1768, and goeth G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) into G1909 the mountains G3735, and seeketh G2212 (PresActInd) that which G3588 is gone astray G4105 (PresPasPtc)?
018:013 And G2532 if so G1437 be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) that he find G2147 (Aor2ActInf) it G0846, verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 G3754, he rejoiceth G5463 (PresActInd) more G3123 of G1909 that G0846 [sheep], than G2228 of G1909 the ninety and nine G1768 which G3588 went G4105 not G3361 astray G4105 (PerfPasPtc).
018:014 Even so G3779 it is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 the will G2307 of G1715 your G5216 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772, that G2443 one G1520 of these G5130 little ones G3398 should perish G0622 (Aor2MidSubj).
018:015 Moreover G1161 if G1437 thy G4675 brother G0080 shall trespass G0264 (AorActSubj) against G1519 thee G4571, go G5217 (PresActImpr) and G2532 tell G1651 him G0846 his fault G1651 (AorActImpr) between G3342 thee G4675 and G2532 him G0846 alone G3441: if G1437 he shall hear G0191 (AorActSubj) thee G4675, thou hast gained G2770 (AorActInd) thy G4675 brother G0080.
018:016 But G1161 if G3362 he will G0191 not G3362 hear G0191 (AorActSubj) [thee, then] take G3880 (Aor2ActImpr) with G3326 thee G4675 one G1520 or G2228 two G1417 more G2089, that G2443 in G1909 the mouth G4750 of two G1417 or G2228 three G5140 witnesses G3144 every G3956 word G4487 may be established G2476 (AorPasSubj).
018:017 And G1161 if G1437 he shall neglect to hear G3878 (AorActSubj) them G0846, tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) [it] unto the church G1577: but G1161 G2532 if G1437 he neglect to hear G3878 (AorActSubj) the church G1577, let him be G2077 (PresImpr) unto thee G4671 as G5618 an heathen man G1482 and G2532 a publican G5057.
018:018 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Whatsoever G3745 G1437 ye shall bind G1210 (AorActSubj) on G1909 earth G1093 shall be G2071 (FutInd) bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 heaven G3772: and G2532 whatsoever G3745 G1437 ye shall loose G3089 (AorActSubj) on G1909 earth G1093 shall be G2071 (FutInd) loosed G3089 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 heaven G3772.
018:019 Again G3825 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 if G1437 two G1417 of you G5216 shall agree G4856 (AorActSubj) on G1909 earth G1093 as touching G4012 any G3956 thing G4229 that G3739 G1437 they shall ask G0154 (AorMidSubj), it shall be done G1096 (FutMidDepInd) for them G0846 of G3844 my G3450 Father G3962 which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772.
018:020 For G1063 where G3757 two G1417 or G2228 three G5140 are G1526 (PresInd) gathered together G4863 (PerfPasPtc) in G1519 my G1699 name G3686, there G1563 am I G1510 (PresInd) in G1722 the midst G3319 of them G0846.
018:021 Then G5119 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) Peter G4074 to him G0846, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, how oft G4212 shall my G3450 brother G0080 sin G0264 (FutActInd) against G1519 me G1691, and G2532 I forgive G0863 (FutActInd) him G0846? till G2193 seven times G2034?
018:022 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, I say G3004 (PresActInd) not G3756 unto thee G4671, Until G2193 seven times G2034: but G0235, Until G2193 seventy times G1441 seven G2033.
018:023 Therefore G1223 G5124 is the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 likened G3666 (AorPasInd) unto a certain G0444 king G0935, which G3739 would G2309 (AorActInd) take G4868 (AorActInf) account G3056 of G3326 his G0846 servants G1401.
018:024 And G1161 when he G0846 had begun G0756 (AorMidPtc) to reckon G4868 (PresActInf), one G1520 was brought G4374 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846, which owed G3781 him G0846 ten thousand G3463 talents G5007.
018:025 But forasmuch as G1161 he G0846 had G2192 (PresActPtc) not G3361 to pay G0591 (Aor2ActInf), his G0846 lord G2962 commanded G2753 (AorActInd) him G0846 to be sold G4097 (AorPasInf), and G2532 his G0846 wife G1135, and G2532 children G5043, and G2532 all G3956 that G3745 he had G2192 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 payment to be made G0591 (AorPasInf).
018:026 The servant G1401 therefore G3767 fell down G4098 (Aor2ActPtc), and worshipped G4352 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, have patience G3114 (AorActImpr) with G1909 me G1698, and G2532 I will pay G0591 (FutActInd) thee G4671 all G3956.
018:027 Then G1161 the lord G2962 of that G1565 servant G1401 was moved with compassion G4697 (AorPasDepPtc), and loosed G0630 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 forgave G0863 (AorActInd) him G0846 the debt G1156.
018:028 But G1161 the same G1565 servant G1401 went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) one G1520 of his G0846 fellowservants G4889, which G3739 owed G3784 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 an hundred G1540 pence G1220: and G2532 he laid hands G2902 (AorActPtc) on him G0846, and took [him] by the throat G4155 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Pay G0591 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427 that G3748 thou owest G3784 (PresActInd).
018:029 And G3767 his G0846 fellowservant G4889 fell down G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) at G1519 his G0846 feet G4228, and besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Have patience G3114 (AorActImpr) with G1909 me G1698, and G2532 I will pay G0591 (FutActInd) thee G4671 all G3956.
018:030 And G1161 he would G2309 (ImpfActInd) not G3756: but G0235 went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 into G1519 prison G5438, till G2193 G3739 he should pay G0591 (Aor2ActSubj) the debt G3784 (PresPasPtc).
018:031 So G1161 when his G0846 fellowservants G4889 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) what was done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), they were very G4970 sorry G3076 (AorPasInd), and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and told G1285 (AorActInd) unto their G0846 lord G2962 all G3956 that was done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc).
018:032 Then G5119 his G0846 lord G2962, after that he had called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) him G0846, said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, O thou wicked G4190 servant G1401, I forgave G0863 (AorActInd) thee G4671 all G3956 that G1565 debt G3782, because G1893 thou desiredst G3870 (AorActInd) me G3165:
018:033 Shouldest G1163 (ImpfInd) not G3756 thou G4571 also G2532 have had compassion G1653 (AorActInf) on thy G4675 fellowservant G4889, even G2532 as G5613 I G1473 had pity G1653 (AorActInd) on thee G4571?
018:034 And G2532 his G0846 lord G2962 was wroth G3710 (AorPasPtc), and delivered G3860 (AorActInd) him G0846 to the tormentors G0930, till G2193 G3739 he should pay G0591 (Aor2ActSubj) all G3956 that was due G3784 (PresPasPtc) unto him G0846.
018:035 So G3779 likewise shall my G3450 heavenly G2032 Father G3962 do G4160 (FutActInd) also G2532 unto you G5213, if G3362 ye from G0575 your G5216 hearts G2588 forgive G0863 (Aor2ActSubj) not G3362 every one G1538 his G0846 brother G0080 their G0846 trespasses G3900.
019:001 ¶  And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), [that] when G3753 Jesus G2424 had finished G5055 (AorActInd) these G5128 sayings G3056, he departed G3332 (AorActInd) from G0575 Galilee G1056, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the coasts G3725 of Judaea G2449 beyond G4008 Jordan G2446;
019:002 And G2532 great G4183 multitudes G3793 followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846; and G2532 he healed G2323 (AorActInd) them G0846 there G1563.
019:003 The Pharisees G5330 also G2532 came G4334 (AorActInd) unto him G0846, tempting G3985 (PresActPtc) him G0846, and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, Is it lawful G1487 G1832 (PresInd) for a man G0444 to put away G0630 (AorActInf) his G0846 wife G1135 for G2596 every G3956 cause G0156?
019:004 And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Have ye G0314 not G3756 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd), that G3754 he which G3588 made G4160 (AorActPtc) [them] at G0575 the beginning G0746 made G4160 (AorActInd) them G0846 male G0730 and G2532 female G2338,
019:005 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), For this G5127 cause G1752 shall a man G0444 leave G2641 (FutActInd) father G3962 and G2532 mother G3384, and G2532 shall cleave G4347 (FutPasInd) to his G0846 wife G1135: and G2532 they twain G1417 shall be G2071 (FutInd) G1519 one G3391 flesh G4561?
019:006 Wherefore G5620 they are G1526 (PresInd) no more G3765 twain G1417, but G0235 one G3391 flesh G4561. What G3739 therefore G3767 God G2316 hath joined together G4801 (AorActInd), let G5563 not G3361 man G0444 put asunder G5563 (PresActImpr).
019:007 They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Why G5101 did Moses G3475 then G3767 command G1781 (AorMidDepInd) to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) a writing G0975 of divorcement G0647, and G2532 to put G0630 her G0846 away G0630 (AorActInf)?
019:008 He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, G3754 Moses G3475 because of G4314 the hardness G4641 of your G5216 hearts G4641 suffered G2010 (AorActInd) you G5213 to put away G0630 (AorActInf) your G5216 wives G1135: but G1161 from G0575 the beginning G0746 it was G1096 (Perf2ActInd) not G3756 so G3779.
019:009 And G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 Whosoever G3739 G0302 shall put away G0630 (AorActSubj) his G0846 wife G1135, except G1508 [it be] for G1909 fornication G4202, and G2532 shall marry G1060 (AorActSubj) another G0243, committeth adultery G3429 (PresMidPasDepInd): and G2532 whoso marrieth G1060 (AorActPtc) her which G3588 is put away G0630 (PerfPasPtc) doth commit adultery G3429 (PresMidPasDepInd).
019:010 His G0846 disciples G3101 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, If G1487 the case G0156 of the man G0444 be G2076 (PresInd) so G3779 with G3326 [his] wife G1135, it is G4851 not G3756 good G4851 (PresActInd) to marry G1060 (AorActInf).
019:011 But G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, All G3956 [men] cannot G3756 receive G5562 (PresActInd) this G5126 saying G3056, save G0235 [they] to whom G3739 it is given G1325 (PerfPasInd).
019:012 For G1063 there are G1526 (PresInd) some eunuchs G2135, which G3748 were so G3779 born G1080 (AorPasInd) from G1537 [their] mother’s G3384 womb G2836: and G2532 there are G1526 (PresInd) some eunuchs G2135, which G3748 were made eunuchs G2134 (AorActInd) of G5259 men G0444: and G2532 there be G1526 (PresInd) eunuchs G2135, which G3748 have made G2134 themselves G1438 eunuchs G2134 (AorActInd) for G1223 the kingdom G0932 of heaven’s sake G3772. He that is able G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to receive G5562 (PresActInf) [it], let him receive G5562 (PresActImpr) [it].
019:013 Then G5119 were there brought G4374 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 little children G3813, that G2443 he should put G2007 [his] hands G5495 on G2007 (Aor2ActSubj) them G0846, and G2532 pray G4336 (AorMidDepSubj): and G1161 the disciples G3101 rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) them G0846.
019:014 But G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Suffer G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) little children G3813, and G2532 forbid G2967 (PresActImpr) them G0846 not G3361, to come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) unto G4314 me G3165: for G1063 of such G5108 is G2076 (PresInd) the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772.
019:015 And G2532 he laid G2007 [his] hands G5495 on G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846, and departed G4198 (AorPasDepInd) thence G1564.
019:016 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), one G1520 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Good G0018 Master G1320, what G5101 good thing G0018 shall I do G4160 (AorActSubj), that G2443 I may have G2192 (PresActSubj) eternal G0166 life G2222?
019:017 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Why G5101 callest thou G3004 (PresActInd) me G3165 good G0018? [there is] none G3762 good G0018 but G1508 one G1520, [that is], God G2316: but G1161 if G1487 thou wilt G2309 (PresActInd) enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 life G2222, keep G5083 (AorActImpr) the commandments G1785.
019:018 He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Which G4169? G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Thou shalt do G5407 no G3756 murder G5407 (FutActInd), Thou shalt G3431 not G3756 commit adultery G3431 (FutActInd), Thou shalt G2813 not G3756 steal G2813 (FutActInd), Thou shalt G5576 not G3756 bear false witness G5576 (FutActInd),
019:019 Honour G5091 (PresActImpr) thy G4675 father G3962 and G2532 [thy] mother G3384: and G2532, Thou shalt love G0025 (FutActInd) thy G4675 neighbour G4139 as G5613 thyself G4572.
019:020 The young man G3495 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, All G3956 these things G5023 have I kept G5442 (AorMidInd) from G1537 my G3450 youth up G3503: what G5101 lack G5302 (PresActInd) I yet G2089?
019:021 Jesus G2424 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto him G0846, If G1487 thou wilt G2309 (PresActInd) be G1511 (PresInf) perfect G5046, go G5217 (PresActImpr) [and] sell G4453 (AorActImpr) that thou G4675 hast G5224 (PresActPtc), and G2532 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) to the poor G4434, and G2532 thou shalt have G2192 (FutActInd) treasure G2344 in G1722 heaven G3772: and G2532 come G1204 (Impr) [and] follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
019:022 But G1161 when the young man G3495 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that saying G3056, he went away G0565 (Aor2ActInd) sorrowful G3076 (PresPasPtc): for G1063 he had G2192 (PresActPtc) G2258 (ImpfInd) great G4183 possessions G2933.
019:023 Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto his G0846 disciples G3101, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 a rich man G4145 shall hardly G1423 enter G1525 (FutMidDepInd) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772.
019:024 And G1161 again G3825 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, It is G2076 (PresInd) easier G2123 for a camel G2574 to go G1330 (Aor2ActInf) through G1223 the eye G5169 of a needle G4476, than G2228 for a rich man G4145 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
019:025 When G1161 his G0846 disciples G3101 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], they were exceedingly G4970 amazed G1605 (ImpfPasInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Who G5101 then G0686 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be saved G4982 (AorPasInf)?
019:026 But G1161 Jesus G2424 beheld G1689 (AorActPtc) [them], and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, With G3844 men G0444 this G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) impossible G0102; but G1161 with G3844 God G2316 all things G3956 are G2076 (PresInd) possible G1415.
019:027 Then G5119 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) Peter G4074 and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), we G2249 have forsaken G0863 (AorActInd) all G3956, and G2532 followed G0190 (AorActInd) thee G4671; what G5101 shall we G2254 have G2071 (FutInd) therefore G0686?
019:028 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 ye G5210 which G3588 have followed G0190 (AorActPtc) me G3427, in G1722 the regeneration G3824 when G3752 the Son G5207 of man G0444 shall sit G2523 (AorActSubj) in G1909 the throne G2362 of his G0846 glory G1391, ye G5210 also G2532 shall sit G2523 (FutMidDepInd) upon G1909 twelve G1427 thrones G2362, judging G2919 (PresActPtc) the twelve G1427 tribes G5443 of Israel G2474.
019:029 And G2532 every G3956 one G3739 that hath forsaken G0863 (AorActInd) houses G3614, or G2228 brethren G0080, or G2228 sisters G0079, or G2228 father G3962, or G2228 mother G3384, or G2228 wife G1135, or G2228 children G5043, or G2228 lands G0068, for my G3450 name’s G3686 sake G1752, shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) an hundredfold G1542, and G2532 shall inherit G2816 (FutActInd) everlasting G0166 life G2222.
019:030 But G1161 many G4183 [that are] first G4413 shall be G2071 (FutInd) last G2078; and G2532 the last G2078 [shall be] first G4413.
020:001 ¶  For G1063 the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 unto a man G0444 [that is] an householder G3617, which G3748 went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) early in the morning G0260 G4404 to hire G3409 (AorMidInf) labourers G2040 into G1519 his G0846 vineyard G0290.
020:002 And G1161 when he had agreed G4856 (AorActPtc) with G3326 the labourers G2040 for G1537 a penny G1220 a day G2250, he sent G0649 (AorActInd) them G0846 into G1519 his G0846 vineyard G0290.
020:003 And G2532 he went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) about G4012 the third G5154 hour G5610, and saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) others G0243 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) idle G0692 in G1722 the marketplace G0058,
020:004 And said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G2548; Go G5217 (PresActImpr) ye G5210 also G2532 into G1519 the vineyard G0290, and G2532 whatsoever G3739 G1437 is G5600 (PresSubj) right G1342 I will give G1325 (FutActInd) you G5213. And G1161 they went their way G0565 (Aor2ActInd).
020:005 Again G3825 he went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) about G4012 the sixth G1623 and G2532 ninth G1766 hour G5610, and did G4160 (AorActInd) likewise G5615.
020:006 And G1161 about G4012 the eleventh G1734 hour G5610 he went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) others G0243 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) idle G0692, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 stand ye G2476 (PerfActInd) here G5602 all G3650 the day G2250 idle G0692?
020:007 They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Because G3754 no man G3762 hath hired G3409 (AorMidInd) us G2248. He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Go G5217 (PresActImpr) ye G5210 also G2532 into G1519 the vineyard G0290; and G2532 whatsoever G3739 G1437 is G5600 (PresSubj) right G1342, [that] shall ye receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd).
020:008 So G1161 when even G3798 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), the lord G2962 of the vineyard G0290 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto his G0846 steward G2012, Call G2564 (AorActImpr) the labourers G2040, and G2532 give G0591 (Aor2ActImpr) them G0846 [their] hire G3408, beginning G0756 (AorMidPtc) from G0575 the last G2078 unto G2193 the first G4413.
020:009 And G2532 when they came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) that [were hired] about G4012 the eleventh G1734 hour G5610, they received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) every man G0303 a penny G1220.
020:010 But G1161 when the first G4413 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), they supposed G3543 (AorActInd) that G3754 they should have received G2983 (FutMidDepInd) more G4119; and G2532 they likewise G2532 received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) every man G0846 G0303 a penny G1220.
020:011 And G1161 when they had received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], they murmured G1111 (ImpfActInd) against G2596 the goodman of the house G3617,
020:012 G3754 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), These G3778 last G2078 have wrought G4160 (AorActInd) [but] one G3391 hour G5610, and G2532 thou hast made G4160 (AorActInd) them G0846 equal G2470 unto us G2254, which G3588 have borne G0941 (AorActPtc) the burden G0922 and G2532 heat G2742 of the day G2250.
020:013 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) one G1520 of them G0846, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Friend G2083, I do G0091 thee G4571 no G3756 wrong G0091 (PresActInd): didst G4856 not G3780 thou agree G4856 (AorActInd) with me G3427 for a penny G1220?
020:014 Take G0142 (AorActImpr) [that] thine G4674 [is], and G2532 go thy way G5217 (PresActImpr): G1161 I will G2309 (PresActInd) give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) unto this G5129 last G2078, even G2532 as G5613 unto thee G4671.
020:015 G2228 Is it not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) for me G3427 to do G4160 (AorActInf) what G3739 I will G2309 (PresActInd) with G1722 mine own G1699? G1487 Is G2076 (PresInd) thine G4675 eye G3788 evil G4190, because G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) good G0018?
020:016 So G3779 the last G2078 shall be G2071 (FutInd) first G4413, and G2532 the first G4413 last G2078: for G1063 many G4183 be G1526 (PresInd) called G2822, but G1161 few G3641 chosen G1588.
020:017 And G2532 Jesus G2424 going up G0305 (PresActPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414 took G3880 (Aor2ActInd) the twelve G1427 disciples G3101 apart G2596 G2398 in G1722 the way G3598, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846,
020:018 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), we go up G0305 (PresActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414; and G2532 the Son G5207 of man G0444 shall be betrayed G3860 (FutPasInd) unto the chief priests G0749 and G2532 unto the scribes G1122, and G2532 they shall condemn G2632 (FutActInd) him G0846 to death G2288,
020:019 And G2532 shall deliver G3860 (FutActInd) him G0846 to the Gentiles G1484 to G1519 mock G1702 (AorActInf), and G2532 to scourge G3146 (AorActInf), and G2532 to crucify G4717 (AorActInf) [him]: and G2532 the third G5154 day G2250 he shall rise again G0450 (FutMidInd).
020:020 Then G5119 came G4334 (Aor2ActInd) to him G0846 the mother G3384 of Zebedee’s G2199 children G5207 with G3326 her G0846 sons G5207, worshipping G4352 (PresActPtc) [him], and G2532 desiring G0154 (PresActPtc) a certain G5100 thing G3844 of him G0846.
020:021 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, What G5101 wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd)? She saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Grant G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) that G2443 these G3778 my G3450 two G1417 sons G5207 may sit G2523 (AorActSubj), the one G1520 on G1537 thy G4675 right hand G1188, and G2532 the other G1520 on G1537 the left G2176, in G1722 thy G4675 kingdom G0932.
020:022 But G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 ye ask G0154 (PresMidInd). Are ye able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) to drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf) of the cup G4221 that G3739 I G1473 shall G3195 (PresActInd) drink of G4095 (PresActInf), and G2532 to be baptized G0907 (PresPasInd) with the baptism G0908 that G3739 I G1473 am baptized with G0907 (AorPasInf)? They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, We are able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd).
020:023 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Ye shall drink G4095 (FutMidDepInd) indeed G3303 of my G3450 cup G4221, and G2532 be baptized G0907 (PresPasInd) with the baptism G0908 that G3739 I G1473 am baptized with G0907 (FutPasInd): but G1161 to sit G2523 (AorActInf) on G1537 my G3450 right hand G1188, and G2532 on G1537 my G3450 left G2176, is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 mine G1699 to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf), but G0235 [it shall be given to them] for whom G3739 it is prepared G2090 (PerfPasInd) of G5259 my G3450 Father G3962.
020:024 And G2532 when the ten G1176 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], they were moved with indignation G0023 (AorActInd) against G4012 the two G1417 brethren G0080.
020:025 But G1161 Jesus G2424 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) them G0846 [unto him], and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 the princes G0758 of the Gentiles G1484 exercise dominion over G2634 (PresActInd) them G0846, and G2532 they that are great G3173 exercise authority upon G2715 (PresActInd) them G0846.
020:026 But G1161 it shall G2071 not G3756 be G2071 (FutInd) so G3779 among G1722 you G5213: but G0235 whosoever G3739 G1437 will G2309 (PresActSubj) be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) great G3173 among G1722 you G5213, let him be G2077 (PresImpr) your G5216 minister G1249;
020:027 And G2532 whosoever G3739 G1437 will G2309 (PresActSubj) be G1511 (PresInf) chief G4413 among G1722 you G5213, let him be G2077 (PresImpr) your G5216 servant G1401:
020:028 Even as G5618 the Son G5207 of man G0444 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 to be ministered unto G1247 (AorPasInf), but G0235 to minister G1247 (AorActInf), and G2532 to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) his G0846 life G5590 a ransom G3083 for G0473 many G4183.
020:029 And G2532 as they G0846 departed G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) from G0575 Jericho G2410, a great G4183 multitude G3793 followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
020:030 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), two G1417 blind men G5185 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) by the way G3598 side G3844, when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 Jesus G2424 passed by G3855 (PresActInd), cried out G2896 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on us G2248, O Lord G2962, [thou] Son G5207 of David G1138.
020:031 And G1161 the multitude G3793 rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) them G0846, because G2443 they should hold their peace G4623 (AorActSubj): but G1161 they cried G2896 (ImpfActInd) the more G3185, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on us G2248, O Lord G2962, [thou] Son G5207 of David G1138.
020:032 And G2532 Jesus G2424 stood still G2476 (Aor2ActPtc), and called G5455 (AorActInd) them G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 will ye G2309 (PresActInd) that I shall do G4160 (AorActSubj) unto you G5213?
020:033 They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, that G2443 our G2257 eyes G3788 may be opened G0455 (AorPasSubj).
020:034 So G1161 Jesus G2424 had compassion G4697 (AorPasDepPtc) [on them], and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) their G0846 eyes G3788: and G2532 immediately G2112 their G0846 eyes G3788 received sight G0308 (AorActInd), and G2532 they followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
021:001 ¶  And G2532 when G3753 they drew nigh G1448 (AorActInd) unto G1519 Jerusalem G2414, and G2532 were come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Bethphage G0967, unto G4314 the mount G3735 of Olives G1636, then G5119 sent G0649 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 two G1417 disciples G3101,
021:002 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto them G0846, Go G4198 (AorPasDepSubj) into G1519 the village G2968 over against G0561 you G5216, and G2532 straightway G2112 ye shall find G2147 (FutActInd) an ass G3688 tied G1210 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 a colt G4454 with G3326 her G0846: loose G3089 (AorActPtc) [them], and bring G0071 (Aor2ActImpr) [them] unto me G3427.
021:003 And G2532 if G1437 any [man] G5100 say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) ought G5100 unto you G5213, ye shall say G2046 (FutActInd), G3754 The Lord G2962 hath G2192 (PresActInd) need G5532 of them G0846; and G1161 straightway G2112 he will send G0649 (FutActInd) them G0846.
021:004 All G1161 G3650 this G5124 was done G1096 (Perf2ActInd), that G2443 it might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G1223 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
021:005 Tell ye G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) the daughter G2364 of Sion G4622, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), thy G4675 King G0935 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto thee G4671, meek G4239, and G2532 sitting G1910 (PerfActPtc) upon G1909 an ass G3688, and G2532 a colt G4454 the foal G5207 of an ass G5268.
021:006 And G1161 the disciples G3101 went G4198 (AorPasDepPtc), and G2532 did G4160 (AorActPtc) as G2531 Jesus G2424 commanded G4367 (AorActInd) them G0846,
021:007 And brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) the ass G3688, and G2532 the colt G4454, and G2532 put G2007 (AorActInd) on G1883 them G0846 their G0846 clothes G2440, and G2532 they set G1940 (AorActInd) G1940 (AorActInd) [him] thereon G1883 G0846.
021:008 And G1161 a very great G4118 multitude G3793 spread G4766 (AorActInd) their G1438 garments G2440 in G1722 the way G3598; others G1161 G0243 cut down G2875 (ImpfActInd) branches G2798 from G0575 the trees G1186, and G2532 strawed G4766 (ImpfActInd) [them] in G1722 the way G3598.
021:009 And G1161 the multitudes G3793 that went before G4254 (PresActPtc), and G2532 that followed G0190 (PresActPtc), cried G2896 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Hosanna G5614 to the Son G5207 of David G1138: Blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [is] he that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962; Hosanna G5614 in G1722 the highest G5310.
021:010 And G2532 when he G0846 was come G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 Jerusalem G2414, all G3956 the city G4172 was moved G4579 (AorPasInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Who G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778?
021:011 And G1161 the multitude G3793 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) Jesus G2424 the prophet G4396 of G0575 Nazareth G3478 of Galilee G1056.
021:012 And G2532 Jesus G2424 went G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the temple G2411 of God G2316, and G2532 cast out G1544 (Aor2ActInd) all them G3956 that sold G4453 (PresActPtc) and G2532 bought G0059 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, and G2532 overthrew G2690 (AorActInd) the tables G5132 of the moneychangers G2855, and G2532 the seats G2515 of them that sold G4453 (PresActPtc) doves G4058,
021:013 And G2532 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, It is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), My G3450 house G3624 shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) the house G3624 of prayer G4335; but G1161 ye G5210 have made G4160 (AorActInd) it G0846 a den G4693 of thieves G3027.
021:014 And G2532 the blind G5185 and G2532 the lame G5560 came G4334 (AorActInd) to him G0846 in G1722 the temple G2411; and G2532 he healed G2323 (AorActInd) them G0846.
021:015 And G1161 when the chief priests G0749 and G2532 scribes G1122 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the wonderful things G2297 that G3739 he did G4160 (AorActInd), and G2532 the children G3816 crying G2896 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Hosanna G5614 to the Son G5207 of David G1138; they were sore displeased G0023 (AorActInd),
021:016 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Hearest thou G0191 (PresActInd) what G5101 these G3778 say G3004 (PresActInd)? And G1161 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Yea G3483; have ye never G3763 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd), G3754 Out of G1537 the mouth G4750 of babes G3516 and G2532 sucklings G2337 (PresActPtc) thou hast perfected G2675 (AorMidInd) praise G0136?
021:017 And G2532 he left G2641 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846, and went G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1854 the city G4172 into G1519 Bethany G0963; and G2532 he lodged G0835 (AorPasDepInd) there G1563.
021:018 Now G1161 in the morning G4405 as he returned G1877 (PresActPtc) into G1519 the city G4172, he hungered G3983 (AorActInd).
021:019 And G2532 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) a G3391 fig tree G4808 in G1909 the way G3598, he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1909 it G0846, and G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) nothing G3762 thereon G1722 G0846, but G1508 leaves G5444 only G3440, and G2532 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto it G0846, Let no G1096 fruit G2590 grow G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) on G1537 thee G4675 henceforward G3371 for G1519 ever G0165. And G2532 presently G3916 the fig tree G4808 withered away G3583 (AorPasInd).
021:020 And G2532 when the disciples G3101 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], they marvelled G2296 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), How G4459 soon G3916 is the fig tree G4808 withered away G3583 (AorPasInd)!
021:021 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, If G1437 ye have G2192 (PresActSubj) faith G4102, and G2532 doubt G1252 (AorPasSubj) not G3361, ye shall G4160 not G3756 only G3440 do G4160 (FutActInd) this G3440 [which is done] to the fig tree G4808, but G0235 also if G2579 ye shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto this G5129 mountain G3735, Be thou removed G0142 (AorPasImpr), and G2532 be thou cast G0906 (AorPasImpr) into G1519 the sea G2281; it shall be done G1096 (FutMidDepInd).
021:022 And G2532 all things G3956, whatsoever G0302 G3745 ye shall ask G0154 (AorActSubj) in G1722 prayer G4335, believing G4100 (PresActPtc), ye shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd).
021:023 And G2532 when he G0846 was come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the temple G2411, the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the elders G4245 of the people G2992 came G4334 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 as he was teaching G1321 (PresActPtc), and said G3004 (PresActPtc), By G1722 what G4169 authority G1849 doest thou G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023? and G2532 who G5101 gave G1325 (AorActInd) thee G4671 this G5026 authority G1849?
021:024 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, I also G2504 will ask G2065 (FutActInd) you G5209 one G1520 thing G3056, which G3739 if G1437 ye tell G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) me G3427, I in like wise G2504 will tell G2046 (FutActInd) you G5213 by G1722 what G4169 authority G1849 I do G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023.
021:025 The baptism G0908 of John G2491, whence G4159 was it G2258 (ImpfInd)? from G1537 heaven G3772, or G2228 of G1537 men G0444? And G1161 they reasoned G1260 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) with G3844 themselves G1438, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), If G1437 we shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), From G1537 heaven G3772; he will say G2046 (FutActInd) unto us G2254, Why G1302 did ye G4100 not G3756 then G3767 believe G4100 (AorActInd) him G0846?
021:026 But G1161 if G1437 we shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), Of G1537 men G0444; we fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepInd) the people G3793; for G1063 all G3956 hold G2192 (PresActInd) John G2491 as G5613 a prophet G4396.
021:027 And G2532 they answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) Jesus G2424, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), We cannot G3756 tell G1492 (PerfActInd). And G2532 he G0846 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto them G0846, Neither G3761 tell G3004 (PresActInd) I G1473 you G5213 by G1722 what G4169 authority G1849 I do G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023.
021:028 But G1161 what G5101 think G1380 (PresActInd) ye G5213? A [certain] man G0444 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) two G1417 sons G5043; and G2532 he came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) to the first G4413, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Son G5043, go G5217 (PresActImpr) work G2038 (PresMidPasDepImpr) to day G4594 in G1722 my G3450 vineyard G0290.
021:029 He answered G1161 G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I will G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756: but G1161 afterward G5305 he repented G3338 (AorPasDepPtc), and went G0565 (Aor2ActInd).
021:030 And G2532 he came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) to the second G1208, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) likewise G5615. And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I G1473 [go], sir G2962: and G2532 went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756.
021:031 Whether G5101 of G1537 them twain G1417 did G4160 (AorActInd) the will G2307 of [his] father G3962? They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, The first G4413. Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 the publicans G5057 and G2532 the harlots G4204 go G4254 into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 before G4254 (PresActInd) you G5209.
021:032 For G1063 John G2491 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 you G5209 in G1722 the way G3598 of righteousness G1343, and G2532 ye believed G4100 (AorActInd) him G0846 not G3756: but G1161 the publicans G5057 and G2532 the harlots G4204 believed G4100 (AorActInd) him G0846: and G1161 ye G5210, when ye had seen G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], repented G3338 (AorPasDepInd) not G3756 afterward G5305, that ye might believe G4100 (AorActInf) him G0846.
021:033 Hear G0191 (AorActImpr) another G0243 parable G3850: There was G2258 (ImpfInd) a certain G0444 G5100 householder G3617, which G3748 planted G5452 (AorActInd) a vineyard G0290, and G2532 hedged G5418 it G0846 round about G4060 (AorActInd), and G2532 digged G3736 (AorActInd) a winepress G3025 in G1722 it G0846, and G2532 built G3618 (AorActInd) a tower G4444, and G2532 let G1554 it G0846 out G1554 (Aor2MidInd) to husbandmen G1092, and G2532 went into a far country G0589 (AorActInd):
021:034 And G1161 when G3753 the time G2540 of the fruit G2590 drew near G1448 (AorActInd), he sent G0649 (AorActInd) his G0846 servants G1401 to G4314 the husbandmen G1092, that they might receive G2983 (Aor2ActInf) the fruits G2590 of it G0846.
021:035 And G2532 the husbandmen G1092 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) his G0846 servants G1401, and beat G1194 (AorActInd) one G3739, G3303 and G1161 killed G0615 (AorActInd) another G3739, and G1161 stoned G3036 (AorPasInd) another G3739.
021:036 Again G3825, he sent G0649 (AorActInd) other G0243 servants G1401 more G4119 than the first G4413: and G2532 they did G4160 (AorActInd) unto them G0846 likewise G5615.
021:037 But G1161 last of all G5305 he sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto G4314 them G0846 his G0846 son G5207, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), They will reverence G1788 (Fut2PasInd) my G3450 son G5207.
021:038 But G1161 when the husbandmen G1092 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the son G5207, they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) among G1722 themselves G1438, This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the heir G2818; come G1205 (Impr), let us kill G0615 (PresActSubj) him G0846, and G2532 let us seize G2722 (Aor2ActSubj) on his G0846 inheritance G2817.
021:039 And G2532 they caught G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and cast G1544 (Aor2ActInd) [him] out of G1854 the vineyard G0290, and G2532 slew G0615 (AorActInd) [him].
021:040 When G3752 the lord G2962 therefore G3767 of the vineyard G0290 cometh G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), what G5101 will he do G4160 (FutActInd) unto those G1565 husbandmen G1092?
021:041 They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, He will miserably G2560 destroy G0622 (FutActInd) those G0846 wicked men G2556, and G2532 will let out G1554 (FutMidDepInd) [his] vineyard G0290 unto other G0243 husbandmen G1092, which G3748 shall render G0591 (FutActInd) him G0846 the fruits G2590 in G1722 their G0846 seasons G2540.
021:042 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Did ye G0314 never G3763 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the scriptures G1124, The stone G3037 which G3739 the builders G3618 (PresActPtc) rejected G0593 (AorActInd), the same G3778 is become G1096 (AorPasDepInd) G1519 the head G2776 of the corner G1137: this G3778 is G3844 the Lord’s G2962 doing G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), and G2532 it is G2076 (PresInd) marvellous G2298 in G1722 our G2257 eyes G3788?
021:043 Therefore G1223 G5124 say I G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 The kingdom G0932 of God G2316 shall be taken G0142 (FutPasInd) from G0575 you G5216, and G2532 given G1325 (FutPasInd) to a nation G1484 bringing forth G4160 (PresActPtc) the fruits G2590 thereof G0846.
021:044 And G2532 whosoever shall fall G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) on G1909 this G5126 stone G3037 shall be broken G4917 (FutPasInd): but G1161 on G1909 whomsoever G3739 G0302 it shall fall G4098 (Aor2ActSubj), it will grind G3039 him G0846 to powder G3039 (FutActInd).
021:045 And G2532 when the chief priests G0749 and G2532 Pharisees G5330 had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) his G0846 parables G3850, they perceived G1097 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 he spake G3004 (PresActInd) of G4012 them G0846.
021:046 But G2532 when they sought G2212 (PresActPtc) to lay hands G2902 (AorActInf) on him G0846, they feared G5399 (AorPasDepInd) the multitude G3793, because G1894 they took G2192 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 for G5613 a prophet G4396.
022:001 ¶  And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846 again G3825 by G1722 parables G3850, and said G3004 (PresActPtc),
022:002 The kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 is like G3666 (AorPasInd) unto a certain G0444 king G0935, which G3748 made G4160 (AorActInd) a marriage G1062 for his G0846 son G5207,
022:003 And G2532 sent forth G0649 (AorActInd) his G0846 servants G1401 to call G2564 (AorActInf) them that were bidden G2564 (PerfPasPtc) to G1519 the wedding G1062: and G2532 they would G2309 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 come G2064 (Aor2ActInf).
022:004 Again G3825, he sent forth G0649 (AorActInd) other G0243 servants G1401, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) them which are bidden G2564 (PerfPasPtc), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I have prepared G2090 (AorActInd) my G3450 dinner G0712: my G3450 oxen G5022 and G2532 [my] fatlings G4619 [are] killed G2380 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 all things G3956 [are] ready G2092: come G1205 (Impr) unto G1519 the marriage G1062.
022:005 But G1161 they made light of G0272 (AorActPtc) [it], and went their ways G0565 (Aor2ActInd), one G3303 to G1519 his G2398 farm G0068, another G1161 to G1519 his G0846 merchandise G1711:
022:006 And G1161 the remnant G3062 took G2902 (AorActPtc) his G0846 servants G1401, and entreated [them] spitefully G5195 (AorActInd), and G2532 slew G0615 (AorActInd) [them].
022:007 But G1161 when the king G0935 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [thereof], he was wroth G3710 (AorPasInd): and G2532 he sent forth G3992 (AorActPtc) his G0846 armies G4753, and destroyed G0622 (AorActInd) those G1565 murderers G5406, and G2532 burned up G1714 (AorActInd) their G0846 city G4172.
022:008 Then G5119 saith he G3004 (PresActInd) to his G0846 servants G1401, G3303 The wedding G1062 is G2076 (PresInd) ready G2092, but G1161 they which were bidden G2564 (PerfPasPtc) were G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3756 worthy G0514.
022:009 Go ye G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) therefore G3767 into G1909 the highways G1327 G3598, and G2532 as many as G3745 G0302 ye shall find G2147 (Aor2ActSubj), bid G2564 (AorActImpr) to G1519 the marriage G1062.
022:010 So G2532 those G1565 servants G1401 went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the highways G3598, and gathered together G4863 (Aor2ActInd) all G3956 as many as G3745 they found G2147 (Aor2ActInd), both G5037 bad G4190 and G2532 good G0018: and G2532 the wedding G1062 was furnished G4130 (AorPasInd) with guests G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
022:011 And G1161 when G1525 the king G0935 came in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) to see G2300 (AorMidDepInf) the guests G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc), he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) there G1563 a man G0444 which had G1746 not G3756 on G1746 (PerfMidPtc) a wedding G1062 garment G1742:
022:012 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Friend G2083, how G4459 camest thou G1525 (Aor2ActInd) in hither G5602 not G3361 having G2192 (PresActPtc) a wedding G1062 garment G1742? And G1161 he was speechless G5392 (AorPasInd).
022:013 Then G5119 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the king G0935 to the servants G1249, Bind G1210 (AorActPtc) him G0846 hand G5495 and G2532 foot G4228, and take G0142 him G0846 away G0142 (AorActImpr), and G2532 cast G1544 (Aor2ActImpr) [him] into G1519 outer G1857 darkness G4655; there G1563 shall be G2071 (FutInd) weeping G2805 and G2532 gnashing G1030 of teeth G3599.
022:014 For G1063 many G4183 are G1526 (PresInd) called G2822, but G1161 few G3641 [are] chosen G1588.
022:015 Then G5119 went G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) the Pharisees G5330, and took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) counsel G4824 how G3704 they might entangle G3802 (AorActSubj) him G0846 in G1722 [his] talk G3056.
022:016 And G2532 they sent out G0649 (PresActInd) unto him G0846 their G0846 disciples G3101 with G3326 the Herodians G2265, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 thou art G1488 (PresInd) true G0227, and G2532 teachest G1321 (PresActInd) the way G3598 of God G2316 in G1722 truth G0225, G2532 neither G3756 carest G3199 (PresActInd) thou G4671 for G4012 any G3762 [man]: for G1063 thou regardest G0991 (PresActInd) not G1519 G3756 the person G4383 of men G0444.
022:017 Tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254 therefore G3767, What G5101 thinkest G1380 (PresActInd) thou G4671? Is it lawful G1832 (PresInd) to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) tribute G2778 unto Caesar G2541, or G2228 not G3756?
022:018 But G1161 Jesus G2424 perceived G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 wickedness G4189, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Why G5101 tempt ye G3985 (PresActInd) me G3165, [ye] hypocrites G5273?
022:019 Shew G1925 (AorActImpr) me G3427 the tribute G2778 money G3546. And G1161 they brought G4374 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 a penny G1220.
022:020 And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Whose G5101 [is] this G3778 image G1504 and G2532 superscription G1923?
022:021 They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Caesar’s G2541. Then G5119 saith he G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Render G0591 (Aor2ActImpr) therefore G3767 unto Caesar G2541 the things which are G3588 Caesar’s G2541; and G2532 unto God G2316 the things that are G3588 God’s G2316.
022:022 When G2532 they had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [these words], they marvelled G2296 (AorActInd), and G2532 left G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and went their way G0565 (Aor2ActInd).
022:023 The same G1722 G1565 day G2250 came G4334 (AorActInd) to him G0846 the Sadducees G4523, which G3588 say G3004 (PresActPtc) that there is G1511 (PresInf) no G3361 resurrection G0386, and G2532 asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846,
022:024 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, Moses G3475 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), If G1437 a man G5100 die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj), having G2192 (PresActPtc) no G3361 children G5043, his G0846 brother G0080 shall marry G1918 (FutActInd) his G0846 wife G1135, and G2532 raise up G0450 (FutActInd) seed G4690 unto his G0846 brother G0080.
022:025 Now G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3844 us G2254 seven G2033 brethren G0080: and G2532 the first G4413, when he had married a wife G1060 (AorActPtc), deceased G5053 (AorActInd), and G2532, having G2192 (PresActPtc) no G3361 issue G4690, left G0863 (AorActInd) his G0846 wife G1135 unto his G0846 brother G0080:
022:026 Likewise G3668 the second G1208 also G2532, and G2532 the third G5154, unto G2193 the seventh G2033.
022:027 And G1161 last G5305 of all G3956 the woman G1135 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) also G2532.
022:028 Therefore G3767 in G1722 the resurrection G0386 whose G5101 wife G1135 shall she be G2071 (FutInd) of the seven G2033? for G1063 they all G3956 had G2192 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846.
022:029 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Ye do err G4105 (PresPasImpr), not G3361 knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) the scriptures G1124, nor G3366 the power G1411 of God G2316.
022:030 For G1063 in G1722 the resurrection G0386 they neither G3777 marry G1060 (PresActInd), nor G3777 are given in marriage G1547 (PresPasInd), but G0235 are G1526 (PresInd) as G5613 the angels G0032 of God G2316 in G1722 heaven G3772.
022:031 But G1161 as touching G4012 the resurrection G0386 of the dead G3498, have ye G0314 not G3756 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd) that which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) unto you G5213 by G5259 God G2316, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
022:032 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) the God G2316 of Abraham G0011, and G2532 the God G2316 of Isaac G2464, and G2532 the God G2316 of Jacob G2384? God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 the God G2316 of the dead G3498, but G0235 of the living G2198 (PresActPtc).
022:033 And G2532 when the multitude G3793 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [this], they were astonished G1605 (ImpfPasInd) at G1909 his G0846 doctrine G1322.
022:034 But G1161 when the Pharisees G5330 had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 he had put G5392 the Sadducees G4523 to silence G5392 (AorActInd), they were gathered together G4863 (AorPasInd) G1909 G0846.
022:035 Then G2532 one G1520 of G1537 them G0846, [which was] a lawyer G3544, asked G1905 (AorActInd) [him a question], tempting G3985 (PresActPtc) him G0846, and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
022:036 Master G1320, which G4169 [is] the great G3173 commandment G1785 in G1722 the law G3551?
022:037 G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thou shalt love G0025 (FutActInd) the Lord G2962 thy G4675 God G2316 with G1722 all G3650 thy G4675 heart G2588, and G2532 with G1722 all G3650 thy G4675 soul G5590, and G2532 with G1722 all G3650 thy G4675 mind G1271.
022:038 This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the first G4413 and G2532 great G3173 commandment G1785.
022:039 And G1161 the second G1208 [is] like G3664 unto it G0846 G3778, Thou shalt love G0025 (FutActInd) thy G4675 neighbour G4139 as G5613 thyself G4572.
022:040 On G1722 these G5025 two G1417 commandments G1785 hang G2910 (PresPasInd) all G3650 the law G3551 and G2532 the prophets G4396.
022:041 While G1161 the Pharisees G5330 were gathered together G4863 (PerfPasPtc), Jesus G2424 asked G1905 (AorActInd) them G0846,
022:042 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 think G1380 (PresActInd) ye G5213 of G4012 Christ G5547? whose G5101 son G5207 is he G2076 (PresInd)? They say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, [The Son] of David G1138.
022:043 He saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, How G4459 then G3767 doth David G1138 in G1722 spirit G4151 call G2564 (PresActInd) him G0846 Lord G2962, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
022:044 The LORD G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto my G3450 Lord G2962, Sit thou G2521 (PresMidPasDepImpr) on G1537 my G3450 right hand G1188, till G2193 G0302 I make G5087 (Aor2ActSubj) thine G4675 enemies G2190 thy G4675 footstool G5286 G4228?
022:045 If G1487 David G1138 then G3767 call G2564 (PresActInd) him G0846 Lord G2962, how G4459 is he G2076 (PresInd) his G0846 son G5207?
022:046 And G2532 no man G3762 was able G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to answer G0611 (AorPasDepInf) him G0846 a word G3056, neither G3761 durst G5111 (AorActInd) any G5100 [man] from G0575 that G1565 day G2250 forth ask G1905 (AorActInf) him G0846 any more G3765 [questions].
023:001 ¶  Then G5119 spake G2980 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 to the multitude G3793, and G2532 to his G0846 disciples G3101,
023:002 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), The scribes G1122 and G2532 the Pharisees G5330 sit G2523 (AorActInd) in G1909 Moses G3475 ’ seat G2515:
023:003 All G3956 therefore G3767 whatsoever G0302 G3745 they bid G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) you G5213 observe G5083 (PresActInf), [that] observe G5083 (PresActImpr) and G2532 do G4160 (PresActImpr); but G1161 do G4160 (PresActImpr) not G3361 ye after G2596 their G0846 works G2041: for G1063 they say G3004 (PresActInd), and G2532 do G4160 (PresActInd) not G3756.
023:004 For G1063 they bind G1195 (PresActInd) heavy G0926 burdens G5413 and G2532 grievous to be borne G1419, and G2532 lay G2007 (PresActInd) [them] on G1909 men’s G0444 shoulders G5606; but G1161 they [themselves] will G2309 (PresActInd) not G3756 move G2795 (AorActInf) them G0846 with one of their G0846 fingers G1147.
023:005 But G1161 all G3956 their G0846 works G2041 they do G4160 (PresActInd) for G4314 to be seen G2300 (AorPasInf) of men G0444: G1161 they make broad G4115 (PresActInd) their G0846 phylacteries G5440, and G2532 enlarge G3170 (PresActInd) the borders G2899 of their G0846 garments G2440,
023:006 And G5037 love G5368 (PresActInd) the uppermost rooms G4411 at G1722 feasts G1173, and G2532 the chief seats G4410 in G1722 the synagogues G4864,
023:007 And G2532 greetings G0783 in G1722 the markets G0058, and G2532 to be called G2564 (PresPasInf) of G5259 men G0444, Rabbi G4461, Rabbi G4461.
023:008 But G1161 be G2564 not G3361 ye G5210 called G2564 (AorPasSubj) Rabbi G4461: for G1063 one G1520 is G2076 (PresInd) your G5216 Master G2519, [even] Christ G5547; and G1161 all G3956 ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) brethren G0080.
023:009 And G2532 call G2564 (AorActSubj) no G3361 [man] your G5216 father G3962 upon G1909 the earth G1093: for G1063 one G1520 is G2076 (PresInd) your G5216 Father G3962, which G3588 is in G1722 heaven G3772.
023:010 Neither G3366 be ye called G2564 (AorPasSubj) masters G2519: for G1063 one G1520 is G2076 (PresInd) your G5216 Master G2519, [even] Christ G5547.
023:011 But G1161 he that is greatest G3187 among you G5216 shall be G2071 (FutInd) your G5216 servant G1249.
023:012 And G1161 whosoever G3748 shall exalt G5312 (FutActInd) himself G1438 shall be abased G5013 (FutPasInd); and G2532 he G3748 that shall humble G5013 (FutActInd) himself G1438 shall be exalted G5312 (FutPasInd).
023:013 But G1161 woe G3759 unto you G5213, scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, hypocrites G5273! for G3754 ye shut up G2808 (PresActInd) the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 against G1715 men G0444: for G1063 ye G5210 neither G3761 go in G1525 (PresMidPasDepInd) [yourselves], neither G3756 suffer ye G0863 (PresActInd) them that are entering G1525 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to go in G1525 (Aor2ActInf).
023:014 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, hypocrites G5273! for G3754 ye devour G2719 (PresActInd) widows G5503 ’ houses G3614, and G2532 for a pretence G4392 make G4336 long G3117 prayer G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc): therefore G1223 G5124 ye shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) the greater G4055 damnation G2917.
023:015 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, hypocrites G5273! for G3754 ye compass G4013 (PresActInd) sea G2281 and G2532 land G3584 to make G4160 (AorActInf) one G1520 proselyte G4339, and G2532 when G3752 he is made G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj), ye make G4160 (PresActInd) him G0846 twofold more G1362 the child G5207 of hell G1067 than yourselves G5216.
023:016 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, [ye] blind G5185 guides G3595, which G3588 say G3004 (PresActPtc), Whosoever G3739 G0302 shall swear G3660 (AorActSubj) by G1722 the temple G3485, it is G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3762; but G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall swear G3660 (AorActSubj) by G1722 the gold G5557 of the temple G3485, he is a debtor G3784 (PresActInd)!
023:017 [Ye] fools G3474 and G2532 blind G5185: for G1063 whether G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) greater G3187, the gold G5557, or G2228 the temple G3485 that sanctifieth G0037 (PresActPtc) the gold G5557?
023:018 And G2532, Whosoever G3739 G1437 shall swear G3660 (AorActSubj) by G1722 the altar G2379, it is G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3762; but G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 sweareth G3660 (AorActSubj) by G1722 the gift G1435 that is upon G1883 it G0846, he is guilty G3784 (PresActInd).
023:019 [Ye] fools G3474 and G2532 blind G5185: for G1063 whether G5101 [is] greater G3187, the gift G1435, or G2228 the altar G2379 that sanctifieth G0037 (PresActPtc) the gift G1435?
023:020 Whoso therefore G3767 shall swear G3660 (AorActPtc) by G1722 the altar G2379, sweareth G3660 (PresActInd) by G1722 it G0846, and G2532 by G1722 all things G3956 thereon G1883 G0846.
023:021 And G2532 whoso shall swear G3660 (AorActPtc) by G1722 the temple G3485, sweareth G3660 (PresActInd) by G1722 it G0846, and G2532 by G1722 him that dwelleth G2730 (PresActPtc) therein G0846.
023:022 And G2532 he that shall swear G3660 (AorActPtc) by G1722 heaven G3772, sweareth G3660 (PresActInd) by G1722 the throne G2362 of God G2316, and G2532 by G1722 him that sitteth G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) thereon G1883 G0846.
023:023 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, hypocrites G5273! for G3754 ye pay tithe G0586 (PresActInd) of mint G2238 and G2532 anise G0432 and G2532 cummin G2951, and G2532 have omitted G0863 (AorActInd) the weightier G0926 [matters] of the law G3551, judgment G2920, G2532 mercy G1656, and G2532 faith G4102: these G5023 ought ye G1163 (ImpfInd) to have done G4160 (AorActInf), and not G3361 to leave G0863 the other G2548 undone G0863 (PresActInf).
023:024 [Ye] blind G5185 guides G3595, which strain at G1368 (PresActPtc) a gnat G2971, and G1161 swallow G2666 (PresActPtc) a camel G2574.
023:025 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, hypocrites G5273! for G3754 ye make clean G2511 (PresActInd) the outside G1855 of the cup G4221 and G2532 of the platter G3953, but G1161 within G2081 they are full G1073 (PresActInd) of G1537 extortion G0724 and G2532 excess G0192.
023:026 [Thou] blind G5185 Pharisee G5330, cleanse G2511 (AorActImpr) first G4412 that [which is] within G1787 the cup G4221 and G2532 platter G3953, that G2443 the outside G1622 of them G0846 may be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) clean G2513 also G2532.
023:027 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, hypocrites G5273! for G3754 ye are like G3945 (PresActInd) unto whited G2867 (PerfPasPtc) sepulchres G5028, which G3748 indeed G3303 appear G5316 (PresMidPasInd) beautiful G5611 outward G1855, but G1161 are within G2081 full G1073 (PresActInd) of dead G3498 [men’s] bones G3747, and G2532 of all G3956 uncleanness G0167.
023:028 Even so G3779 ye G5210 also G2532 G3303 outwardly G1855 appear G5316 (PresPasInd) righteous G1342 unto men G0444, but G1161 within G2081 ye are G2075 (PresInd) full G3324 of hypocrisy G5272 and G2532 iniquity G0458.
023:029 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, hypocrites G5273! because G3754 ye build G3618 (PresActInd) the tombs G5028 of the prophets G4396, and G2532 garnish G2885 (PresActInd) the sepulchres G3419 of the righteous G1342,
023:030 And G2532 say G3004 (PresActInd), If G1487 we had been G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the days G2250 of our G2257 fathers G3962, we would G0302 not G3756 have been G2258 (ImpfInd) partakers G2844 with them G0846 in G1722 the blood G0129 of the prophets G4396.
023:031 Wherefore G5620 ye be witnesses G3140 (PresActInd) unto yourselves G1438, that G3754 ye are G2075 (PresInd) the children G5207 of them which killed G5407 (AorActPtc) the prophets G4396.
023:032 Fill G4137 ye G5210 up G4137 (AorActImpr) then G2532 the measure G3358 of your G5216 fathers G3962.
023:033 [Ye] serpents G3789, [ye] generation G1081 of vipers G2191, how G4459 can ye G5343 (Aor2ActSubj) escape G0575 the damnation G2920 of hell G1067?
023:034 Wherefore G1223 G5124, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 send G0649 (PresActInd) unto G4314 you G5209 prophets G4396, and G2532 wise men G4680, and G2532 scribes G1122: and G2532 [some] of G1537 them G0846 ye shall kill G0615 (FutActInd) and G2532 crucify G4717 (FutActInd); and G2532 [some] of G1537 them G0846 shall ye scourge G3146 (FutActInd) in G1722 your G5216 synagogues G4864, and G2532 persecute G1377 (FutActInd) [them] from G0575 city G4172 to G1519 city G4172:
023:035 That G3704 upon G1909 you G5209 may come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) all G3956 the righteous G1342 blood G0129 shed G1632 (PresPasPtc) upon G1909 the earth G1093, from G0575 the blood G0129 of righteous G1342 Abel G0006 unto G2193 the blood G0129 of Zacharias G2197 son G5207 of Barachias G0914, whom G3739 ye slew G5407 (AorActInd) between G3342 the temple G3485 and G2532 the altar G2379.
023:036 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, All G3956 these things G5023 shall come G2240 (FutActInd) upon G1909 this G5026 generation G1074.
023:037 O Jerusalem G2419, Jerusalem G2419, [thou] that killest G0615 (PresActPtc) the prophets G4396, and G2532 stonest G3036 (PresActPtc) them which are sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc) unto G4314 thee G0846, how often G4212 would I G2309 (AorActInd) have gathered G1996 thy G4675 G3739 children G5043 together G1996 (Aor2ActInf), even as G5158 a hen G3733 gathereth G1996 (PresActInd) her G1438 chickens G3556 under G5259 [her] wings G4420, and G2532 ye would G2309 (AorActInd) not G3756!
023:038 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), your G5216 house G3624 is left G0863 (PresPasInd) unto you G5213 desolate G2048.
023:039 For G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Ye shall G1492 not G3364 see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) me G3165 henceforth G0575 G0737, till G2193 G0302 ye shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), Blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [is] he that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962.
024:001 ¶  And G2532 Jesus G2424 went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and departed G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) from G0575 the temple G2411: and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 came G4334 (AorActInd) to [him] for to shew G1925 (AorActInf) him G0846 the buildings G3619 of the temple G2411.
024:002 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, See ye G0991 (PresActInd) not G3756 all G3956 these things G5023? verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, There shall G0863 not G3364 be left G0863 (AorPasSubj) here G5602 one stone G3037 upon G1909 another G3037, that G3739 shall G2647 not G3364 be thrown down G2647 (FutPasInd).
024:003 And G1161 as he G0846 sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) upon G1909 the mount G3735 of Olives G1636, the disciples G3101 came G4334 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 privately G2596 G2398, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254, when G4219 shall G2071 these things G5023 be G2071 (FutInd)? and G2532 what G5101 [shall be] the sign G4592 of thy G4674 coming G3952, and G2532 of the end G4930 of the world G0165?
024:004 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Take heed G0991 (PresActImpr) that no G3361 man G5100 deceive G4105 (AorActSubj) you G5209.
024:005 For G1063 many G4183 shall come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) in G1909 my G3450 name G3686, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) Christ G5547; and G2532 shall deceive G4105 (FutActInd) many G4183.
024:006 And G1161 ye shall G3195 (FutActInd) hear G0191 (PresActInf) of wars G4171 and G2532 rumours G0189 of wars G4171: see G3708 (PresActImpr) that ye be G2360 not G3361 troubled G2360 (PresPasImpr): for G1063 all G3956 [these things] must G1163 (PresInd) come to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf), but G0235 the end G5056 is G2076 (PresInd) not yet G3768.
024:007 For G1063 nation G1484 shall rise G1453 (FutPasInd) against G1909 nation G1484, and G2532 kingdom G0932 against G1909 kingdom G0932: and G2532 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) famines G3042, and G2532 pestilences G3061, and G2532 earthquakes G4578, in divers G2596 places G5117.
024:008 All G1161 G3956 these G5023 [are] the beginning G0746 of sorrows G5604.
024:009 Then G5119 shall they deliver G3860 you G5209 up G3860 (FutActInd) to G1519 be afflicted G2347, and G2532 shall kill G0615 (FutActInd) you G5209: and G2532 ye shall be G2071 (FutInd) hated G3404 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 all G3956 nations G1484 for G1223 my G3450 name’s sake G3686.
024:010 And G2532 then G5119 shall many G4183 be offended G4624 (FutPasInd), and G2532 shall betray G3860 (FutActInd) one another G0240, and G2532 shall hate G3404 (FutActInd) one another G0240.
024:011 And G2532 many G4183 false prophets G5578 shall rise G1453 (FutPasInd), and G2532 shall deceive G4105 (FutActInd) many G4183.
024:012 And G2532 because G1223 iniquity G0458 shall abound G4129 (AorPasInf), the love G0026 of many G4183 shall wax cold G5594 (Fut2PasInd).
024:013 But G1161 he that shall endure G5278 (AorActPtc) unto G1519 the end G5056, the same G3778 shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd).
024:014 And G2532 this G5124 gospel G2098 of the kingdom G0932 shall be preached G2784 (FutPasInd) in G1722 all G3650 the world G3625 for G1519 a witness G3142 unto all G3956 nations G1484; and G2532 then G5119 shall the end G5056 come G2240 (FutActInd).
024:015 When G3752 ye therefore G3767 shall see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) the abomination G0946 of desolation G2050, spoken of G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G1223 Daniel G1158 the prophet G4396, stand G2476 (Perf2ActPtc) G2476 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 the holy G0040 place G5117, (whoso readeth G0314 (PresActPtc), let him understand G3539 (PresActImpr):)
024:016 Then G5119 let them which be in G1722 Judaea G2449 flee G5343 (PresActImpr) into G1909 the mountains G3735:
024:017 Let him which is on G1909 the housetop G1430 not G3361 come down G2597 (PresActImpr) to take G0142 (AorActInf) any thing G5100 out of G1537 his G0846 house G3614:
024:018 G2532 Neither G3361 let him which is in G1722 the field G0068 return G1994 (AorActImpr) back G3694 to take G0142 (AorActInf) his G0846 clothes G2440.
024:019 And G1161 woe G3759 unto them that are G2192 (PresActPtc) with G1722 child G1064, and G2532 to them that give suck G2337 (PresActPtc) in G1722 those G1565 days G2250!
024:020 But G1161 pray ye G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr) that G3363 your G5216 flight G5437 be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) not G3363 in the winter G5494, neither G3366 on G1722 the sabbath day G4521:
024:021 For G1063 then G5119 shall be G2071 (FutInd) great G3173 tribulation G2347, such as G3634 was G1096 (Perf2ActInd) not G3756 since G0575 the beginning G0746 of the world G2889 to this G2193 time G3568, no G3761, nor ever G3364 shall be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj).
024:022 And G2532 except G1508 those G1565 days G2250 should be shortened G2856 (AorPasInd), there G3756 should G0302 no G3956 flesh G4561 be saved G4982 (AorPasInd): but G1161 for G1223 the elect’s sake G1588 those G1565 days G2250 shall be shortened G2856 (FutPasInd).
024:023 Then G5119 if G1437 any man G5100 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto you G5213, Lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), here G5602 [is] Christ G5547, or G2228 there G5602; believe G4100 (AorActSubj) [it] not G3361.
024:024 For G1063 there shall arise G1453 (FutPasInd) false Christs G5580, and G2532 false prophets G5578, and G2532 shall shew G1325 (FutActInd) great G3173 signs G4592 and G2532 wonders G5059; insomuch that G5620, if G1487 [it were] possible G1415, they shall deceive G4105 (AorActInf) the very G2532 elect G1588.
024:025 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I have told G4280 you G5213 before G4280 (PerfActInd).
024:026 Wherefore G3767 if G1437 they shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto you G5213, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), he is G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 the desert G2048; go G1831 not G3361 forth G1831 (Aor2ActSubj): behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), [he is] in G1722 the secret chambers G5009; believe G4100 (AorActSubj) [it] not G3361.
024:027 For G1063 as G5618 the lightning G0796 cometh G1831 (PresMidPasDepInd) out of G0575 the east G0395, and G2532 shineth G5316 (PresMidPasInd) even unto G2193 the west G1424; so G3779 shall G2071 also G2532 the coming G3952 of the Son G5207 of man G0444 be G2071 (FutInd).
024:028 For G1063 wheresoever G1437 G3699 the carcase G4430 is G5600 (PresSubj), there G1563 will G4863 the eagles G0105 be gathered together G4863 (FutPasInd).
024:029 Immediately G1161 G2112 after G3326 the tribulation G2347 of those G1565 days G2250 shall the sun G2246 be darkened G4654 (FutPasInd), and G2532 the moon G4582 shall G1325 not G3756 give G1325 (FutActInd) her G0846 light G5338, and G2532 the stars G0792 shall fall G4098 (FutMidPasDepInd) from G0575 heaven G3772, and G2532 the powers G1411 of the heavens G3772 shall be shaken G4531 (FutPasInd):
024:030 And G2532 then G5119 shall appear G5316 (Fut2PasInd) the sign G4592 of the Son G5207 of man G0444 in G1722 heaven G3772: and G2532 then G5119 shall G2875 all G3956 the tribes G5443 of the earth G1093 mourn G2875 (FutMidDepInd), and G2532 they shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1909 the clouds G3507 of heaven G3772 with G3326 power G1411 and G2532 great G4183 glory G1391.
024:031 And G2532 he shall send G0649 (FutActInd) his G0846 angels G0032 with G3326 a great G3173 sound G5456 of a trumpet G4536, and G2532 they shall gather together G1996 (FutActInd) his G0846 elect G1588 from G1537 the four G5064 winds G0417, from G0575 one end G0206 of heaven G3772 to G2193 the other G0206 G0846.
024:032 Now G1161 learn G3129 (Aor2ActImpr) a parable G3850 of G0575 the fig tree G4808; When G3752 his G0846 branch G2798 is G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) yet G2235 tender G0527, and G2532 putteth forth G1631 (PresActSubj) leaves G5444, ye know G1097 (PresActInd) that G3754 summer G2330 [is] nigh G1451:
024:033 So G3779 likewise G2532 ye G5210, when G3752 ye shall see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) all G3956 these things G5023, know G1097 (PresActInd) that G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) near G1451, [even] at G1909 the doors G2374.
024:034 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, This G3778 generation G1074 shall not G3364 pass G3928 (Aor2ActSubj), till G0302 G2193 all G3956 these things G5023 be fulfilled G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj).
024:035 Heaven G3772 and G2532 earth G1093 shall pass away G3928 (FutMidDepInd), but G1161 my G3450 words G3056 shall G3928 not G3364 pass away G3928 (Aor2ActSubj).
024:036 But G1161 of G4012 that G1565 day G2250 and G2532 hour G5610 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) no G3762 [man], no, not G3761 the angels G0032 of heaven G3772, but G1508 my G3450 Father G3962 only G3441.
024:037 But G1161 as G5618 the days G2250 of Noe G3575 [were], so G3779 shall G2071 also G2532 the coming G3952 of the Son G5207 of man G0444 be G2071 (FutInd).
024:038 For G1063 as G5618 in G1722 the days G2250 that were G2258 (ImpfInd) before G4253 the flood G2627 they were eating G5176 (PresActPtc) and G2532 drinking G4095 (PresActPtc), marrying G1060 (PresActPtc) and G2532 giving in marriage G1547 (PresActPtc), until G0891 the day G2250 that G3739 Noe G3575 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the ark G2787,
024:039 And G2532 knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 until G2193 the flood G2627 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 took G0142 them all G0537 away G0142 (AorActInd); so G3779 shall G2071 also G2532 the coming G3952 of the Son G5207 of man G0444 be G2071 (FutInd).
024:040 Then G5119 shall G2071 two G1417 be G2071 (FutInd) in G1722 the field G0068; the one G1520 shall be taken G3880 (PresPasInd), and G2532 the other G1520 left G0863 (PresPasInd).
024:041 Two G1417 [women shall be] grinding G0229 (PresActPtc) at G1722 the mill G3459; the one G3391 shall be taken G3880 (PresPasInd), and G2532 the other G3391 left G0863 (PresPasInd).
024:042 Watch G1127 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767: for G3754 ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G4169 hour G5610 your G5216 Lord G2962 doth come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd).
024:043 But G1161 know G1097 (PresActInd) this G1565, that G3754 if G1487 the goodman of the house G3617 had known G1492 (PlupfActInd) in what G4169 watch G5438 the thief G2812 would come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), he would G0302 have watched G1127 (AorActInd), and G2532 would G0302 not G3756 have suffered G1439 (AorActInd) his G0846 house G3614 to be broken up G1358 (Aor2PasInf).
024:044 Therefore G1223 G5124 be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) ye G5210 also G2532 ready G2092: for G3754 in such G3739 an hour G5610 as ye think G1380 (PresActInd) not G3756 the Son G5207 of man G0444 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd).
024:045 Who G5101 then G0686 is G2076 (PresInd) a faithful G4103 and G2532 wise G5429 servant G1401, whom G3739 his G0846 lord G2962 hath made ruler G2525 (AorActInd) over G1909 his G0846 household G2322, to give G1325 (PresActInf) them G0846 meat G5160 in G1722 due season G2540?
024:046 Blessed G3107 [is] that G1565 servant G1401, whom G3739 his G0846 lord G2962 when he cometh G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) shall find G2147 (FutActInd) so G3779 doing G4160 (PresActPtc).
024:047 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 he shall make G2525 him G0846 ruler G2525 (FutActInd) over G1909 all G3956 his G0846 goods G5224 (PresActPtc).
024:048 But and G1161 if G1437 that G1565 evil G2556 servant G1401 shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 his G0846 heart G2588, My G3450 lord G2962 delayeth G5549 (PresActInd) his coming G2064 (Aor2ActInf);
024:049 And G2532 shall begin G0756 (AorMidSubj) to smite G5180 (PresActInf) [his] fellowservants G4889, and G1161 to eat G2068 (PresActInf) and G2532 drink G4095 (PresActInf) with G3326 the drunken G3184 (PresActPtc);
024:050 The lord G2962 of that G1565 servant G1401 shall come G2240 (FutActInd) in G1722 a day G2250 when G3739 he looketh G4328 (PresActInd) not G3756 for [him], and G2532 in G1722 an hour G5610 that G3739 he is G1097 not G3756 aware of G1097 (PresActInd),
024:051 And G2532 shall cut G1371 him G0846 asunder G1371 (FutActInd), and G2532 appoint G5087 (FutActInd) [him] his G0846 portion G3313 with G3326 the hypocrites G5273: there G1563 shall be G2071 (FutInd) weeping G2805 and G2532 gnashing G1030 of teeth G3599.
025:001 ¶  Then G5119 shall the kingdom G0932 of heaven G3772 be likened G3666 (FutPasInd) unto ten G1176 virgins G3933, which G3748 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 lamps G2985, and went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) to meet G0529 G1519 the bridegroom G3566.
025:002 And G1161 five G4002 of G1537 them G0846 were G2258 (ImpfInd) wise G5429, and G2532 five G4002 [were] foolish G3474.
025:003 They G3748 that [were] foolish G3474 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 G1438 lamps G2985, and took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) no G3756 oil G1637 with G3326 them G1438:
025:004 But G1161 the wise G5429 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) oil G1637 in G1722 their G0846 vessels G0030 with G3326 their G0846 lamps G2985.
025:005 While G1161 the bridegroom G3566 tarried G5549 (PresActPtc), they all G3956 slumbered G3573 (AorActInd) and G2532 slept G2518 (ImpfActInd).
025:006 And G1161 at midnight G3319 G3571 there was a cry G2906 made G1096 (Perf2ActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the bridegroom G3566 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd); go ye out G1831 (PresMidPasDepImpr) to G1519 meet G0529 him G0846.
025:007 Then G5119 all G3956 those G1565 virgins G3933 arose G1453 (AorPasInd), and G2532 trimmed G2885 (AorActInd) their G0846 lamps G2985.
025:008 And G1161 the foolish G3474 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the wise G5429, Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254 of G1537 your G5216 oil G1637; for G3754 our G2257 lamps G2985 are gone out G4570 (PresPasInd).
025:009 But G1161 the wise G5429 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), [Not so]; lest G3379 there be G0714 not G3756 enough G0714 (AorActSubj) for us G2254 and G2532 you G5213: but G1161 go ye G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) rather G3123 to them G4314 that sell G4453 (PresActPtc), and G2532 buy G0059 (AorActImpr) for yourselves G1438.
025:010 And G1161 while they G0846 went G0565 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to buy G0059 (AorActInf), the bridegroom G3566 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 they that were ready G2092 went in G1525 (Aor2ActInd) with G3326 him G0846 to G1519 the marriage G1062: and G2532 the door G2374 was shut G2808 (AorPasInd).
025:011 Afterward G1161 G5305 came G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) also G2532 the other G3062 virgins G3933, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, Lord G2962, open G0455 (AorActImpr) to us G2254.
025:012 But G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, I know G1492 (PerfActInd) you G5209 not G3756.
025:013 Watch G1127 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767, for G3754 ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) neither G3756 the day G2250 nor G3761 the hour G5610 wherein G1722 G3739 the Son G5207 of man G0444 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd).
025:014 For G1063 [the kingdom of heaven is] as G5618 a man G0444 travelling into a far country G0589 (PresActPtc), [who] called G2564 (AorActInd) his own G2398 servants G1401, and G2532 delivered G3860 (AorActInd) unto them G0846 his G0846 goods G5224 (PresActPtc).
025:015 And G2532 unto one G3739 G3303 he gave G1325 (AorActInd) five G4002 talents G5007, G1161 to another G3739 two G1417, and G1161 to another G3739 one G1520; to every man G1538 according G2596 to his several G2398 ability G1411; and G2532 straightway G2112 took his journey G0589 (AorActInd).
025:016 Then G1161 he that had received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the five G4002 talents G5007 went G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) and traded G2038 (AorMidDepInd) with G1722 the same G0846, and G2532 made G4160 (AorActInd) [them] other G0243 five G4002 talents G5007.
025:017 And G2532 likewise G5615 he that [had received] G3588 two G1417, he G0846 also G2532 gained G2770 (AorActInd) other G0243 two G1417.
025:018 But G1161 he that had received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) one G1520 went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and digged G3736 (AorActInd) in G1722 the earth G1093, and G2532 hid G0613 (AorActInd) his G0846 lord’s G2962 money G0694.
025:019 After G1161 G3326 a long G4183 time G5550 the lord G2962 of those G1565 servants G1401 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 reckoneth G4868 (PresActInd) G3056 with G3326 them G0846.
025:020 And so G2532 he that had received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) five G4002 talents G5007 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and brought G4374 (AorActInd) other G0243 five G4002 talents G5007, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, thou deliveredst G3860 (AorActInd) unto me G3427 five G4002 talents G5007: behold G2396, I have gained G2770 (AorActInd) beside G1909 them G0846 five G4002 talents G5007 more G0243.
025:021 G1161 His G0846 lord G2962 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto him G0846, Well done G2095, [thou] good G0018 and G2532 faithful G4103 servant G1401: thou hast been G2258 (ImpfInd) faithful G4103 over G1909 a few things G3641, I will make G2525 thee G4571 ruler G2525 (FutActInd) over G1909 many things G4183: enter thou G1525 (Aor2ActImpr) into G1519 the joy G5479 of thy G4675 lord G2962.
025:022 G1161 He also G2532 that had received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) two G1417 talents G5007 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, thou deliveredst G3860 (AorActInd) unto me G3427 two G1417 talents G5007: behold G2396, I have gained G2770 (AorActInd) two G1417 other G0243 talents G5007 beside G1909 them G0846.
025:023 His G0846 lord G2962 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto him G0846, Well done G2095, good G0018 and G2532 faithful G4103 servant G1401; thou hast been G2258 (ImpfInd) faithful G4103 over G1909 a few things G3641, I will make G2525 thee G4571 ruler G2525 (FutActInd) over G1909 many things G4183: enter thou G1525 (Aor2ActImpr) into G1519 the joy G5479 of thy G4675 lord G2962.
025:024 Then G1161 G2532 he which had received G2983 (PerfActPtc) the one G1520 talent G5007 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, I knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571 that G3754 thou art G1488 (PresInd) an hard G4642 man G0444, reaping G2325 (PresActPtc) where G3699 thou hast G4687 not G3756 sown G4687 (AorActInd), and G2532 gathering G4863 (PresActPtc) where G3606 thou hast G1287 not G3756 strawed G1287 (AorActInd):
025:025 And G2532 I was afraid G5399 (AorPasDepPtc), and went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and hid G2928 (AorActInd) thy G4675 talent G5007 in G1722 the earth G1093: lo G2396, [there] thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) [that is] thine G4674.
025:026 G1161 His G0846 lord G2962 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, [Thou] wicked G4190 and G2532 slothful G3636 servant G1401, thou knewest G1492 (PlupfActInd) that G3754 I reap G2325 (PresActInd) where G3699 I sowed G4687 (AorActInd) not G3756, and G2532 gather G4863 (PresActInd) where G3606 I have G1287 not G3756 strawed G1287 (AorActInd):
025:027 Thou G4571 oughtest G1163 (ImpfInd) therefore G3767 to have put G0906 (Aor2ActInf) my G3450 money G0694 to the exchangers G5133, and G2532 [then] at my coming G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) I G1473 should G0302 have received G2865 (AorMidInd) mine own G1699 with G4862 usury G5110.
025:028 Take G0142 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767 the talent G5007 from G0575 him G0846, and G2532 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) [it] unto him which hath G2192 (PresActPtc) ten G1176 talents G5007.
025:029 For G1063 unto every one G3956 that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) shall be given G1325 (FutPasInd), and G2532 he shall have abundance G4052 (FutPasInd): but G1161 from G0575 him G0846 that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) not G3361 shall be taken away G0142 (FutPasInd) G0575 even G2532 that which G3739 he hath G2192 (PresActInd).
025:030 And G2532 cast ye G1544 (PresActImpr) the unprofitable G0888 servant G1401 into G1519 outer G1857 darkness G4655: there G1563 shall be G2071 (FutInd) weeping G2805 and G2532 gnashing G1030 of teeth G3599.
025:031 When G1161 G3752 the Son G5207 of man G0444 shall come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 his G0846 glory G1391, and G2532 all G3956 the holy G0040 angels G0032 with G3326 him G0846, then G5119 shall he sit G2523 (FutActInd) upon G1909 the throne G2362 of his G0846 glory G1391:
025:032 And G2532 before G1715 him G0846 shall be gathered G4863 (FutPasInd) all G3956 nations G1484: and G2532 he shall separate G0873 (FutActInd) them G0846 one G0240 from G0575 another G0240, as G5618 a shepherd G4166 divideth G0873 (PresActInd) [his] sheep G4263 from G0575 the goats G2056:
025:033 And G2532 he shall set G2476 (FutActInd) G3303 the sheep G4263 on G1537 his G0846 right hand G1188, but G1161 the goats G2055 on G1537 the left G2176.
025:034 Then G5119 shall the King G0935 say G2046 (FutActInd) unto them on G1537 his G0846 right hand G1188, Come G1205 (Impr), ye blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) of my G3450 Father G3962, inherit G2816 (AorActImpr) the kingdom G0932 prepared G2090 (PerfPasPtc) for you G5213 from G0575 the foundation G2602 of the world G2889:
025:035 For G1063 I was an hungred G3983 (AorActInd), and G2532 ye gave G1325 (AorActInd) me G3427 meat G5315 (Aor2ActInf): I was thirsty G1372 (AorActInd), and G2532 ye gave G4222 me G3165 drink G4222 (AorActInd): I was G2252 (ImpfInd) a stranger G3581, and G2532 ye took G4863 me G3165 in G4863 (Aor2ActInd):
025:036 Naked G1131, and G2532 ye clothed G4016 (Aor2ActInd) me G3165: I was sick G0770 (AorActInd), and G2532 ye visited G1980 (AorMidDepInd) me G3165: I was G2252 (ImpfInd) in G1722 prison G5438, and G2532 ye came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 me G3165.
025:037 Then G5119 shall the righteous G1342 answer G0611 (FutPasDepInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, when G4219 saw we G1492 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571 an hungred G3983 (PresActPtc), and G2532 fed G5142 (AorActInd) [thee]? or G2228 thirsty G1372 (PresActPtc), and G2532 gave [thee] drink G4222 (AorActInd)?
025:038 G1161 When G4219 saw we G1492 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571 a stranger G3581, and G2532 took [thee] in G4863 (Aor2ActInd)? or G2228 naked G1131, and G2532 clothed G4016 (Aor2ActInd) [thee]?
025:039 G1161 Or when G4219 saw we G1492 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571 sick G0772, or G2228 in G1722 prison G5438, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 thee G4571?
025:040 And G2532 the King G0935 shall answer G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and say G2046 (FutActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Inasmuch G1909 as G3745 ye have done G4160 (AorActInd) [it] unto one G1520 of the least G1646 of these G5130 my G3450 brethren G0080, ye have done G4160 (AorActInd) [it] unto me G1698.
025:041 Then G5119 shall he say G2046 (FutActInd) also G2532 unto them on G1537 the left hand G2176, Depart G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) from G0575 me G1700, ye cursed G2672 (PerfPasPtc), into G1519 everlasting G0166 fire G4442, prepared G2090 (PerfPasPtc) for the devil G1228 and G2532 his G0846 angels G0032:
025:042 For G1063 I was an hungred G3983 (AorActInd), and G2532 ye gave G1325 (AorActInd) me G3427 no G3756 meat G5315 (Aor2ActInf): I was thirsty G1372 (AorActInd), and G2532 ye gave G4222 me G3165 no G3756 drink G4222 (AorActInd):
025:043 I was G2252 (ImpfInd) a stranger G3581, and G2532 ye took G4863 me G3165 not G3756 in G4863 (Aor2ActInd): naked G1131, and G2532 ye clothed G4016 (Aor2ActInd) me G3165 not G3756: sick G0772, and G2532 in G1722 prison G5438, and G2532 ye visited G1980 (AorMidDepInd) me G3165 not G3756.
025:044 Then G5119 shall they G0846 also G2532 answer G0611 (FutPasDepInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, when G4219 saw we G1492 (Aor2ActInd) thee G4571 an hungred G3983 (PresActPtc), or G2228 athirst G1372 (PresActPtc), or G2228 a stranger G3581, or G2228 naked G1131, or G2228 sick G0772, or G2228 in G1722 prison G5438, and G2532 did G1247 not G3756 minister G1247 (AorActInd) unto thee G4671?
025:045 Then G5119 shall he answer G0611 (FutPasDepInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Inasmuch G1909 as G3745 ye did G4160 (AorActInd) [it] not G3756 to one G1520 of the least G1646 of these G5130, ye did G4160 (AorActInd) [it] not G3761 to me G1698.
025:046 And G2532 these G3778 shall go away G0565 (FutMidDepInd) into G1519 everlasting G0166 punishment G2851: but G1161 the righteous G1342 into G1519 life G2222 eternal G0166.
026:001 ¶  And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), when G3753 Jesus G2424 had finished G5055 (AorActInd) all G3956 these G5128 sayings G3056, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto his G0846 disciples G3101,
026:002 Ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 after G3326 two G1417 days G2250 is G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) [the feast of] the passover G3957, and G2532 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is betrayed G3860 (PresPasInd) to G1519 be crucified G4717 (AorPasInf).
026:003 Then G5119 assembled together G4863 (AorPasInd) the chief priests G0749, and G2532 the scribes G1122, and G2532 the elders G4245 of the people G2992, unto G1519 the palace G0833 of the high priest G0749, who G3588 was called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Caiaphas G2533,
026:004 And G2532 consulted G4823 (AorMidInd) that G2443 they might take G2902 (AorActSubj) Jesus G2424 by subtilty G1388, and G2532 kill G0615 (PresActSubj) [him].
026:005 But G1161 they said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Not G3361 on G1722 the feast G1859 [day], lest G3363 there be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) an uproar G2351 among G1722 the people G2992.
026:006 Now G1161 when Jesus G2424 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) in G1722 Bethany G0963, in G1722 the house G3614 of Simon G4613 the leper G3015,
026:007 There came G4334 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846 a woman G1135 having G2192 (PresActPtc) an alabaster box G0211 of very precious G0927 ointment G3464, and G2532 poured it G2708 (AorActInd) on G1909 his G0846 head G2776, as he sat G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc) [at meat].
026:008 But G1161 when his G0846 disciples G3101 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], they had indignation G0023 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), To G1519 what purpose G5101 [is] this G3778 waste G0684?
026:009 For G1063 this G5124 ointment G3464 might G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) have been sold G4097 (AorPasInf) for much G4183, and G2532 given G1325 (AorPasInf) to the poor G4434.
026:010 When G1161 Jesus G2424 understood G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 trouble ye G2873 G3930 (PresActInd) the woman G1135? for G1063 she hath wrought G2038 (AorMidDepInd) a good G2570 work G2041 upon G1519 me G1691.
026:011 For G1063 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) the poor G4434 always G3842 with G3326 you G1438; but G1161 me G1691 ye have G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 always G3842.
026:012 For in that G1063 she G3778 G0846 hath poured G0906 (Aor2ActPtc) this G5124 ointment G3464 on G1909 my G3450 body G4983, she did G4160 (AorActInd) [it] for G4314 my G3165 burial G1779 (AorActInf).
026:013 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Wheresoever G3699 G1437 this G5124 gospel G2098 shall be preached G2784 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 the whole G3650 world G2889, [there] shall also G2532 this, that G3739 this woman G3778 G0846 hath done G4160 (AorActInd), be told G2980 (FutPasInd) for G1519 a memorial G3422 of her G0846.
026:014 Then G5119 one G1520 of the twelve G1427, called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Judas G2455 Iscariot G2469, went G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) unto G4314 the chief priests G0749,
026:015 And said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) [unto them], What G5101 will ye G2309 (PresActInd) give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) me G3427, and G2504 I will deliver G3860 (FutActInd) him G0846 unto you G5213? And G1161 they covenanted G2476 (Aor2ActInd) with him G0846 for thirty G5144 pieces of silver G0694.
026:016 And G2532 from G0575 that time G5119 he sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) opportunity G2120 to G2443 betray G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) him G0846.
026:017 Now G1161 the first G4413 [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread G0106 the disciples G3101 came G4334 (AorActInd) to Jesus G2424, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, Where G4226 wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd) that we prepare G2090 (AorActSubj) for thee G4671 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) the passover G3957?
026:018 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Go G5217 (PresActImpr) into G1519 the city G4172 to G4314 such a man G1170, and G2532 say G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) unto him G0846, The Master G1320 saith G3004 (PresActInd), My G3450 time G2540 is G2076 (PresInd) at hand G1451; I will keep G4160 (PresActInd) the passover G3957 at G4314 thy house G4571 with G3326 my G3450 disciples G3101.
026:019 And G2532 the disciples G3101 did G4160 (AorActInd) as G5613 Jesus G2424 had appointed G4929 (AorActInd) them G0846; and G2532 they made ready G2090 (AorActInd) the passover G3957.
026:020 Now G1161 when the even G3798 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), he sat down G0345 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) with G3326 the twelve G1427.
026:021 And G2532 as they G0846 did eat G2068 (PresActPtc), he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 one G1520 of G1537 you G5216 shall betray G3860 (FutActInd) me G3165.
026:022 And G2532 they were exceeding G4970 sorrowful G3076 (PresPasPtc), and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) every one G1538 of them G0846 to say G3004 (PresActInf) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, is G1510 (PresInd) it G3385 I G1473?
026:023 And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), He that dippeth G1686 (AorActPtc) [his] hand G5495 with G3326 me G1700 in G1722 the dish G5165, the same G3778 shall betray G3860 (FutActInd) me G3165.
026:024 G3303 The Son G5207 of man G0444 goeth G5217 (PresActInd) as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) of G4012 him G0846: but G1161 woe G3759 unto that G1565 man G0444 by G1223 whom G3739 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is betrayed G3860 (PresPasInd)! it had been G2258 (ImpfInd) good G2570 for that G1565 man G0846 if G1487 he G0444 had G1080 not G3756 been born G1080 (AorPasInd).
026:025 Then G1161 Judas G2455, which G3588 betrayed G3860 (PresActPtc) him G0846, answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Master G4461, is G1510 (PresInd) it G3385 I G1473? He said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Thou G4771 hast said G2036 (Aor2ActInd).
026:026 And G1161 as they G0846 were eating G2068 (PresActPtc), Jesus G2424 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) bread G0740, and G2532 blessed G2127 (AorActPtc) [it], and brake G2806 (AorActInd) [it], and G2532 gave G1325 (ImpfActInd) [it] to the disciples G3101, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Take G2983 (Aor2ActImpr), eat G5315 (Aor2ActImpr); this G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 body G4983.
026:027 And G2532 he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the cup G4221, and G2532 gave thanks G2168 (AorActPtc), and gave G1325 (AorActInd) [it] to them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Drink ye G4095 (Aor2ActImpr) all G3956 of G1537 it G0846;
026:028 For G1063 this G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 blood G0129 of the new G2537 testament G1242, which G3588 is shed G1632 (PresPasPtc) for G4012 many G4183 for G1519 the remission G0859 of sins G0266.
026:029 But G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, I will G4095 not G3754 G3364 drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj) henceforth G0575 G0737 of G1537 this G5127 fruit G1081 of the vine G0288, until G2193 that G1565 day G2250 when G3752 I drink G4095 (PresActSubj) it G0846 new G2537 with G3326 you G5216 in G1722 my G3450 Father’s G3962 kingdom G0932.
026:030 And G2532 when they had sung an hymn G5214 (AorActPtc), they went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the mount G3735 of Olives G1636.
026:031 Then G5119 saith G3004 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 unto them G0846, All G3956 ye G5210 shall be offended G4624 (FutPasInd) because G1722 of me G1722 G1698 this G5026 night G3571: for G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), I will smite G3960 (FutActInd) the shepherd G4166, and G2532 the sheep G4263 of the flock G4167 shall be scattered abroad G1287 (FutPasInd).
026:032 But G1161 after G3326 I G3165 am risen again G1453 (AorPasInf), I will go before G4254 (FutActInd) you G5209 into G1519 Galilee G1056.
026:033 Peter G4074 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Though G1499 all G3956 [men] shall be offended G4624 (FutPasInd) because G1722 of thee G4671, [yet] will I G1473 never G3763 be offended G4624 (FutPasInd).
026:034 Jesus G2424 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto him G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, That G3754 this G1722 G5026 night G3571, before G4250 the cock G0220 crow G5455 (AorActInf), thou shalt deny G0533 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165 thrice G5151.
026:035 Peter G4074 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Though G2579 I G3165 should G1163 (PresSubj) die G0599 (Aor2ActInf) with G4862 thee G4671, yet G3364 will I G0533 not G3364 deny G0533 (FutMidDepInd) thee G4571. Likewise G3668 also G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) all G3956 the disciples G3101.
026:036 Then G5119 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) Jesus G2424 with G3326 them G0846 unto G1519 a place G5564 called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Gethsemane G1068, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto the disciples G3101, Sit ye G2523 (AorActImpr) here G0847, while G2193 G3739 I go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and pray G4336 (AorMidDepSubj) yonder G1563.
026:037 And G2532 he took with him G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) Peter G4074 and G2532 the two G1417 sons G5207 of Zebedee G2199, and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to be sorrowful G3076 (PresPasInf) and G2532 very heavy G0085 (PresActInf).
026:038 Then G5119 saith he G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, My G3450 soul G5590 is G2076 (PresInd) exceeding sorrowful G4036, even unto G2193 death G2288: tarry ye G3306 (AorActImpr) here G5602, and G2532 watch G1127 (PresActImpr) with G3326 me G1700.
026:039 And G2532 he went G4281 a little G3397 further G4281 (Aor2ActPtc), and fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 his G0846 face G4383, and G2532 prayed G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), O my G3450 Father G3962, if G1487 it be G2076 (PresInd) possible G1415, let G3928 this G5124 cup G4221 pass G3928 (Aor2ActImpr) from G0575 me G1700: nevertheless G4133 not G3756 as G5613 I G1473 will G2309 (PresActInd), but G0235 as G5613 thou G4771 [wilt].
026:040 And G2532 he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 the disciples G3101, and G2532 findeth G2147 (PresActInd) them G0846 asleep G2518 (PresActPtc), and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto Peter G4074, What G3779, could ye G2480 (AorActInd) not G3756 watch G1127 (AorActInf) with G3326 me G1700 one G3391 hour G5610?
026:041 Watch G1127 (PresActImpr) and G2532 pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr), that G3363 ye enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) not G3363 into G1519 temptation G3986: the spirit G4151 indeed G3303 [is] willing G4289, but G1161 the flesh G4561 [is] weak G0772.
026:042 He went away G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) again G3825 the G1537 second time G1208, and prayed G4336 (AorMidDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), O my G3450 Father G3962, if G1487 this G5124 cup G4221 may G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 pass away G3928 (Aor2ActInf) from G0575 me G1700, except G3362 I drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj) it G0846, thy G4675 will G2307 be done G1096 (AorPasDepImpr).
026:043 And G2532 he came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and found G2147 (PresActInd) them G0846 asleep G2518 (PresActPtc) again G3825: for G1063 their G0846 eyes G3788 were G2258 (ImpfInd) heavy G0916 (PerfPasPtc).
026:044 And G2532 he left G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846, and went away G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) again G3825, and prayed G4336 (AorMidDepInd) G1537 the third time G5154, saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) the same G0846 words G3056.
026:045 Then G5119 cometh he G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 his G0846 disciples G3101, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Sleep on G2518 (PresActInd) now G3063, and G2532 take [your] rest G0373 (PresMidInd/PresMidImpr): behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the hour G5610 is at hand G1448 (PerfActInd), and G2532 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is betrayed G3860 (PresPasInd) into G1519 the hands G5495 of sinners G0268.
026:046 Rise G1453 (PresMidPasImpr), let us be going G0071 (PresActSubj): behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), he is at hand G1448 (PerfActInd) that doth betray G3860 (PresActPtc) me G3165.
026:047 And G2532 while G2089 he G0846 yet G2089 spake G2980 (PresActPtc), lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), Judas G2455, one G1520 of the twelve G1427, came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 with G3326 him G0846 a great G4183 multitude G3793 with G3326 swords G3162 and G2532 staves G3586, from G0575 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 elders G4245 of the people G2992.
026:048 Now G1161 he that betrayed G3860 (PresActPtc) him G0846 gave G1325 (AorActInd) them G0846 a sign G4592, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Whomsoever G3739 G0302 I shall kiss G5368 (AorActSubj), that same G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) he G0846: hold G2902 him G0846 fast G2902 (AorActImpr).
026:049 And G2532 forthwith G2112 he came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) to Jesus G2424, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Hail G5463 (PresActImpr), master G4461; and G2532 kissed G2705 (AorActInd) him G0846.
026:050 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Friend G2083, wherefore G1909 G3739 art thou come G3918 (PresInd)? Then G5119 came they G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), and laid G1911 (Aor2ActInd) hands G5495 on G1909 Jesus G2424, and G2532 took G2902 (AorActInd) him G0846.
026:051 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), one G1520 of them which were with G3326 Jesus G2424 stretched out G1614 (AorActPtc) [his] hand G5495, and drew G0645 (AorActInd) his G0846 sword G3162, and G2532 struck G3960 (AorActPtc) a servant G1401 of the high priest’s G0749, and smote off G0851 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 ear G5621.
026:052 Then G5119 said G3004 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 unto him G0846, Put up again G0654 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 sword G3162 into G1519 his G0846 place G5117: for G1063 all they G3956 that take G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the sword G3162 shall perish G0622 (FutMidInd) with G1722 the sword G3162.
026:053 G2228 Thinkest thou G1380 (PresActInd) that G3754 I cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) now G0737 pray G3870 (AorActInf) to my G3450 Father G3962, and G2532 he shall presently give G3936 (FutActInd) me G3427 more G4119 than G2228 twelve G1427 legions G3003 of angels G0032?
026:054 But how G4459 then G3767 shall the scriptures G1124 be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj), that G3754 thus G3779 it must G1163 (PresInd) be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf)?
026:055 In G1722 that same G1565 hour G5610 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 to the multitudes G3793, Are ye come out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) as G5613 against G1909 a thief G3027 with G3326 swords G3162 and G2532 staves G3586 for to take G4815 (Aor2ActInf) me G3165? I sat G2516 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) daily G2250 G2596 with G4314 you G5209 teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, and G2532 ye laid G2902 no G3756 hold G2902 (AorActInd) on me G3165.
026:056 But G1161 all G3650 this G5124 was done G1096 (Perf2ActInd), that G2443 the scriptures G1124 of the prophets G4396 might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj). Then G5119 all G3956 the disciples G3101 forsook G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and fled G5343 (Aor2ActInd).
026:057 And G1161 they that had laid hold G2902 (AorActPtc) on Jesus G2424 led [him] away G0520 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 Caiaphas G2533 the high priest G0749, where G3699 the scribes G1122 and G2532 the elders G4245 were assembled G4863 (AorPasInd).
026:058 But G1161 Peter G4074 followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 afar off G0575 G3113 unto G2193 the high priest’s G0749 palace G0833, and G2532 went G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) in G2080, and sat G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) with G3326 the servants G5257, to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) the end G5056.
026:059 Now G1161 the chief priests G0749, and G2532 elders G4245, and G2532 all G3650 the council G4892, sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) false witness G5577 against G2596 Jesus G2424, to G3704 put G2289 him G0846 to death G2289 (AorActSubj);
026:060 But G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) none G3756: yea G2532, though many G4183 false witnesses G5575 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), [yet] found they G2147 (Aor2ActInd) none G3756. G1161 At the last G5305 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) two G1417 false witnesses G5575,
026:061 And said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), This G3778 [fellow] said G5346 (ImpfInd), I am able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) to destroy G2647 (AorActInf) the temple G3485 of God G2316, and G2532 to build G3618 (AorActInf) it G0846 in G1223 three G5140 days G2250.
026:062 And G2532 the high priest G0749 arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Answerest thou G0611 (PresMidPasDepInd) nothing G3762? what G5101 [is it which] these G3778 witness against G2649 (PresActInd) thee G4675?
026:063 But G1161 Jesus G2424 held his peace G4623 (ImpfActInd). And G2532 the high priest G0749 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, I adjure G1844 (PresActInd) thee G4571 by G2596 the living G2198 (PresActPtc) God G2316, that G2443 thou tell G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) us G2254 whether G1487 thou G4771 be G1488 (PresInd) the Christ G5547, the Son G5207 of God G2316.
026:064 Jesus G2424 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Thou G4771 hast said G2036 (Aor2ActInd): nevertheless G4133 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Hereafter G0737 G0575 shall ye see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1537 the right hand G1188 of power G1411, and G2532 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1909 the clouds G3507 of heaven G3772.
026:065 Then G5119 the high priest G0749 rent G1284 (AorActInd) his G0846 clothes G2440, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 He hath spoken blasphemy G0987 (AorActInd); what G5101 further G2089 need G5532 have we G2192 (PresActInd) of witnesses G3144? behold G2396, now G3568 ye have heard G0191 (AorActInd) his G0846 blasphemy G0988.
026:066 What G5101 think G1380 (PresActInd) ye G5213? They answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), He is G2076 (PresInd) guilty G1777 of death G2288.
026:067 Then G5119 did they spit G1716 (AorActInd) in G1519 his G0846 face G4383, and G2532 buffeted G2852 (AorActInd) him G0846; and G1161 others smote [him] with the palms of their hands G4474 (AorActInd),
026:068 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Prophesy G4395 (AorActImpr) unto us G2254, thou Christ G5547, Who G5101 is he G2076 (PresInd) that smote G3817 (AorActPtc) thee G4571?
026:069 Now G1161 Peter G4074 sat G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) without G1854 in G1722 the palace G0833: and G2532 a G3391 damsel G3814 came G4334 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Thou G4771 also G2532 wast G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 Jesus G2424 of Galilee G1057.
026:070 But G1161 he denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) before G1715 [them] all G3956, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 thou sayest G3004 (PresActInd).
026:071 And G1161 when he G0846 was gone out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the porch G4440, another G0243 [maid] saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, and G2532 said G3004 (PresActInd) unto them that were there G1563, This G3778 [fellow] was G2258 (ImpfInd) also G2532 with G3326 Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480.
026:072 And G2532 again G3825 he denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) with G3326 an oath G3727, G3754 I do G1492 not G3756 know G1492 (PerfActInd) the man G0444.
026:073 And G1161 after G3326 a while G3397 came unto [him] they G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) that stood by G2476 (PerfActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to Peter G4074, Surely G0230 thou G4771 also G2532 art G1488 (PresInd) [one] of G1537 them G0846; for G1063 G2532 thy G4675 speech G2981 bewrayeth G1212 thee G4571 G4160 (PresActInd).
026:074 Then G5119 began he G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to curse G2653 (PresActInf) and G2532 to swear G3660 (PresActInf), [saying], G3754 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 the man G0444. And G2532 immediately G2112 the cock G0220 crew G5455 (AorActInd).
026:075 And G2532 Peter G4074 remembered G3415 (AorPasInd) the word G4487 of Jesus G2424, which G3588 said G2046 (PerfActPtc) unto him G0846, Before G3754 G4250 the cock G0220 crow G5455 (AorActInf), thou shalt deny G0533 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165 thrice G5151. And G2532 he went out G1854, and G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) wept G2799 (AorActInd) bitterly G4090.
027:001 ¶  When G1161 the morning G4405 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), all G3956 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 elders G4245 of the people G2992 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) counsel G4824 against G2596 Jesus G2424 to G5620 put G2289 him G0846 to death G2289 (AorActInf):
027:002 And G2532 when they had bound G1210 (AorActPtc) him G0846, they led [him] away G0520 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 delivered G3860 (AorActInd) him G0846 to Pontius G4194 Pilate G4091 the governor G2232.
027:003 Then G5119 Judas G2455, which G3588 had betrayed G3860 (PresActPtc) him G0846, when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he was condemned G2632 (AorPasInd), repented himself G3338 (AorPasDepPtc), and brought again G0654 (AorActInd) the thirty G5144 pieces of silver G0694 to the chief priests G0749 and G2532 elders G4245,
027:004 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I have sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd) in that I have betrayed G3860 (Aor2ActPtc) the innocent G0121 blood G0129. And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 [is that] to G4314 us G2248? see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) thou G4771 [to that].
027:005 And G2532 he cast down G4496 (AorActPtc) the pieces of silver G0694 in G1722 the temple G3485, and departed G0402 (AorActInd), and G2532 went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and hanged himself G0519 (AorMidInd).
027:006 And G1161 the chief priests G0749 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the silver pieces G0694, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), It is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) for to put G0906 (Aor2ActInf) them G0846 into G1519 the treasury G2878, because G1893 it is G2076 (PresInd) the price G5092 of blood G0129.
027:007 And G1161 they took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) counsel G4824, and bought G0059 (AorActInd) with G1537 them G0846 the potter’s G2763 field G0068, to G1519 bury G5027 strangers G3581 in G5027.
027:008 Wherefore G1352 that G1565 field G0068 was called G2564 (AorPasInd), The field G0068 of blood G0129, unto G2193 this day G4594.
027:009 Then G5119 was fulfilled G4137 (AorPasInd) that which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G1223 Jeremy G2408 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), And G2532 they took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the thirty G5144 pieces of silver G0694, the price G5092 of him that was valued G5091 (PerfPasPtc), whom G3739 they of G0575 the children G5207 of Israel G2474 did value G5091 (AorMidInd);
027:010 And G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) them G0846 for G1519 the potter’s G2763 field G0068, as G2505 the Lord G2962 appointed G4929 (AorActInd) me G3427.
027:011 And G1161 Jesus G2424 stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) before G1715 the governor G2232: and G2532 the governor G2232 asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 the King G0935 of the Jews G2453? And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto him G0846, Thou G4771 sayest G3004 (PresActInd).
027:012 And G2532 when G1722 he G0846 was accused G2723 (PresPasInf) of G5259 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 elders G4245, he answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) nothing G3762.
027:013 Then G5119 said G3004 (PresActInd) Pilate G4091 unto him G0846, Hearest thou G0191 (PresActInd) not G3756 how many things G4214 they witness against G2649 (PresActInd) thee G4675?
027:014 And G2532 he answered G3756 G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846 to G4314 never G3761 a G1520 word G4487; insomuch G5620 that the governor G2232 marvelled G2296 (PresActInf) greatly G3029.
027:015 Now G1161 at G2596 [that] feast G1859 the governor G2232 was wont G1486 (PlupfActInd) to release G0630 (PresActInf) unto the people G3793 a G1520 prisoner G1198, whom G3739 they would G2309 (ImpfActInd).
027:016 And G1161 they had G2192 (ImpfActInd) then G5119 a notable G1978 prisoner G1198, called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Barabbas G0912.
027:017 Therefore G3767 when they G0846 were gathered together G4863 (PerfPasPtc), Pilate G4091 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Whom G5101 will ye G2309 (PresActInd) that I release G0630 (AorActSubj) unto you G5213? Barabbas G0912, or G2228 Jesus G2424 which G3588 is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Christ G5547?
027:018 For G1063 he knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) that G3754 for G1223 envy G5355 they had delivered G3860 (AorActInd) him G0846.
027:019 When G1161 he G0846 was set down G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the judgment seat G0968, his G0846 wife G1135 sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G2532 Have thou G4671 nothing G3367 to do with that G1565 just man G1342: for G1063 I have suffered G3958 (Aor2ActInd) many things G4183 this day G4594 in G2596 a dream G3677 because G1223 of him G0846.
027:020 But G1161 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 elders G4245 persuaded G3982 (AorActInd) the multitude G3793 that G2443 they should ask G0154 (AorMidSubj) Barabbas G0912, and G1161 destroy G0622 (AorActSubj) Jesus G2424.
027:021 The governor G2232 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Whether G5101 of G0575 the twain G1417 will ye G2309 (PresActInd) that I release G0630 (AorActSubj) unto you G5213? G1161 They said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Barabbas G0912.
027:022 Pilate G4091 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, What G5101 shall I do G4160 (FutActInd) then G3767 with Jesus G2424 which G3588 is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Christ G5547? [They] all G3956 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Let him be crucified G4717 (AorPasImpr).
027:023 And G1161 the governor G2232 said G5346 (ImpfInd), Why G1063, what G5101 evil G2556 hath he done G4160 (AorActInd)? But G1161 they cried out G2896 (ImpfActInd) the more G4057, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Let him be crucified G4717 (AorPasImpr).
027:024 When G1161 Pilate G4091 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he could prevail G5623 (PresActInd) nothing G3762, but G0235 [that] rather G3123 a tumult G2351 was made G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd), he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) water G5204, and washed G0633 (AorMidInd) [his] hands G5495 before G0561 the multitude G3793, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I am G1510 (PresInd) innocent G0121 of G0575 the blood G0129 of this G5127 just person G1342: see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) ye G5210 [to it].
027:025 Then G2532 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) all G3956 the people G2992, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), His G0846 blood G0129 [be] on G1909 us G2248, and G2532 on G1909 our G2257 children G5043.
027:026 Then G5119 released he G0630 (AorActInd) Barabbas G0912 unto them G0846: and G1161 when he had scourged G5417 (AorActPtc) Jesus G2424, he delivered G3860 (AorActInd) [him] to G2443 be crucified G4717 (AorPasSubj).
027:027 Then G5119 the soldiers G4757 of the governor G2232 took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) Jesus G2424 into G1519 the common hall G4232, and gathered G4863 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1909 him G0846 the whole G3650 band G4686 [of soldiers].
027:028 And G2532 they stripped G1562 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and put on G4060 (AorActInd) him G0846 a scarlet G2847 robe G5511.
027:029 And G2532 when they had platted G4120 (AorActPtc) a crown G4735 of G1537 thorns G0173, they put G2007 (AorActInd) [it] upon G1909 his G0846 head G2776, and G2532 a reed G2563 in G1909 his G0846 right hand G1188: and G2532 they bowed the knee G1120 (AorActPtc) before G1715 him G0846, and mocked G1702 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Hail G5463 (PresActImpr), King G0935 of the Jews G2453!
027:030 And G2532 they spit G1716 (AorActPtc) upon G1519 him G0846, and took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the reed G2563, and G2532 smote G5180 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 on G1519 the head G2776.
027:031 And G2532 after G3753 that they had mocked G1702 (AorActInd) him G0846, they took G1562 the robe G5511 off G1562 (AorActInd) from him G0846, and G2532 put G1746 his own G0846 raiment G2440 on G1746 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 led G0520 him G0846 away G0520 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 crucify G4717 (AorActInf) [him].
027:032 And G1161 as they came out G1831 (PresMidPasDepPtc), they found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) a man G0444 of Cyrene G2956, Simon G4613 by name G3686: him G5126 they compelled G0029 (AorActInd) to G2443 bear G0142 (AorActSubj) his G0846 cross G4716.
027:033 And G2532 when they were come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) unto G1519 a place G5117 called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Golgotha G1115, that G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) to say G3004 (PresPasPtc), a place G5117 of a skull G2898,
027:034 They gave G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 vinegar G3690 to drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf) mingled G3396 (PerfPasPtc) with G3326 gall G5521: and G2532 when he had tasted G1089 (AorMidDepPtc) [thereof], he would G2309 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf).
027:035 And G1161 they crucified G4717 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and parted G1266 (AorMidInd) his G0846 garments G2440, casting G0906 (PresActPtc) lots G2819: that G2443 it might be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) which G3588 was spoken G4483 (AorPasPtc) by G5259 the prophet G4396, They parted G1266 (AorMidInd) my G3450 garments G2440 among them G1438, and G2532 upon G1909 my G3450 vesture G2441 did they cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) lots G2819.
027:036 And G2532 sitting down G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) they watched G5083 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 there G1563;
027:037 And G2532 set up G2007 (AorActInd) over G1883 his G0846 head G2776 his G0846 accusation G0156 written G1125 (PerfPasPtc), THIS G3778 IS G2076 (PresInd) JESUS G2424 THE KING G0935 OF THE JEWS G2453.
027:038 Then G5119 were there two G1417 thieves G3027 crucified G4717 (PresPasInd) with G4862 him G0846, one G1520 on G1537 the right hand G1188, and G2532 another G1520 on G1537 the left G2176.
027:039 And G1161 they that passed by G3899 (PresMidPasDepPtc) reviled G0987 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, wagging G2795 (PresActPtc) their G0846 heads G2776,
027:040 And G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Thou that destroyest G2647 (PresActPtc) the temple G3485, and G2532 buildest G3618 (PresActPtc) [it] in G1722 three G5140 days G2250, save G4982 (AorActImpr) thyself G4572. If G1487 thou be G1488 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316, come down G2597 (Aor2ActImpr) from G0575 the cross G4716.
027:041 G1161 Likewise G3668 also G2532 the chief priests G0749 mocking G1702 (PresActPtc) [him], with G3326 the scribes G1122 and G2532 elders G4245, said G3004 (ImpfActInd),
027:042 He saved G4982 (AorActInd) others G0243; himself G1438 he cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) save G4982 (AorActInf). If G1487 he be G2076 (PresInd) the King G0935 of Israel G2474, let him G2597 now G3568 come down G2597 (Aor2ActImpr) from G0575 the cross G4716, and G2532 we will believe G4100 (FutActInd) him G0846.
027:043 He trusted G3982 (Perf2ActInd) in G1909 God G2316; let him deliver G4506 (AorMidDepImpr) him G0846 now G3568, if G1487 he will have G2309 (PresActInd) him G0846: for G1063 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316.
027:044 G1161 The thieves G3027 also G2532, which G3588 were crucified G4957 (AorPasPtc) with him G0846, cast G3679 the same G0846 in his G0846 teeth G3679 (ImpfActInd).
027:045 Now G1161 from G0575 the sixth G1623 hour G5610 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) darkness G4655 over G1909 all G3956 the land G1093 unto G2193 the ninth G1766 hour G5610.
027:046 And G1161 about G4012 the ninth G1766 hour G5610 Jesus G2424 cried G0310 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Eli G2241, Eli G2241, lama G2982 sabachthani G4518? that G5123 (PresInd) is to say, My G3450 God G2316, my G3450 God G2316, why G2444 hast thou forsaken G1459 (Aor2ActInd) me G3165?
027:047 G1161 Some of them G5100 that stood G2476 (PerfActPtc) there G1563, when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [that], said G3004 (ImpfActInd) G3754, This G3778 [man] calleth for G5455 (PresActInd) Elias G2243.
027:048 And G2532 straightway G2112 one G1520 of G1537 them G0846 ran G5143 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) a spunge G4699, and G5037 filled G4130 (AorActPtc) [it] with vinegar G3690, and G2532 put [it] on G4060 (Aor2ActPtc) a reed G2563, and gave G4222 him G0846 to drink G4222 (ImpfActInd).
027:049 The G1161 rest G3062 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Let be G0863 (Aor2ActImpr), let us see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) whether G1487 Elias G2243 will come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to save G4982 (FutActPtc) him G0846.
027:050 G1161 Jesus G2424, when he had cried G2896 (AorActPtc) again G3825 with a loud G3173 voice G5456, yielded up G0863 (AorActInd) the ghost G4151.
027:051 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the veil G2665 of the temple G3485 was rent G4977 (AorPasInd) in G1519 twain G1417 from G0575 the top G0509 to G2193 the bottom G2736; and G2532 the earth G1093 did quake G4579 (AorPasInd), and G2532 the rocks G4073 rent G4977 (AorPasInd);
027:052 And G2532 the graves G3419 were opened G0455 (AorPasInd); and G2532 many G4183 bodies G4983 of the saints G0040 which G3588 slept G2837 (PerfPasPtc) arose G1453 (AorPasInd),
027:053 And G2532 came G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G1537 the graves G3419 after G3326 his G0846 resurrection G1454, and went G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the holy G0040 city G4172, and G2532 appeared G1718 (AorPasInd) unto many G4183.
027:054 Now G1161 when the centurion G1543, and G2532 they that were with G3326 him G0846, watching G5083 (PresActPtc) Jesus G2424, saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the earthquake G4578, and G2532 those things that were done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), they feared G5399 (AorPasDepInd) greatly G4970, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Truly G0230 this G3778 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316.
027:055 And G1161 many G4183 women G1135 were G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563 beholding G2334 (PresActPtc) afar off G0575 G3113, which G3748 followed G0190 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 from G0575 Galilee G1056, ministering G1247 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846:
027:056 Among G1722 which G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094, and G2532 Mary G3137 the mother G3384 of James G2385 and G2532 Joses G2500, and G2532 the mother G3384 of Zebedee’s G2199 children G5207.
027:057 When G1161 the even G3798 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), there came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) a rich G4145 man G0444 of G0575 Arimathaea G0707, named G5122 Joseph G2501, who G3739 also G2532 himself G0846 was G3100 Jesus G2424 ’ disciple G3100 (AorActInd):
027:058 He G3778 went G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) to Pilate G4091, and begged G0154 (AorMidInd) the body G4983 of Jesus G2424. Then G5119 Pilate G4091 commanded G2753 (AorActInd) the body G4983 to be delivered G0591 (AorPasInf).
027:059 And G2532 when Joseph G2501 had taken G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the body G4983, he wrapped G1794 (AorActInd) it G0846 in a clean G2513 linen cloth G4616,
027:060 And G2532 laid G5087 (AorActInd) it G0846 in G1722 his own G0846 new G2537 tomb G3419, which G3739 he had hewn out G2998 (AorActInd) in G1722 the rock G4073: and G2532 he rolled G4351 (AorActPtc) a great G3173 stone G3037 to the door G2374 of the sepulchre G3419, and departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd).
027:061 And G1161 there G1563 was G2258 (ImpfInd) Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094, and G2532 the other G0243 Mary G3137, sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) over against G0561 the sepulchre G5028.
027:062 Now G1161 the next day G1887, that G3748 followed G2076 (PresInd) G3326 the day of the preparation G3904, the chief priests G0749 and G2532 Pharisees G5330 came together G4863 (AorPasInd) unto G4314 Pilate G4091,
027:063 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Sir G2962, we remember G3415 (AorPasInd) that G3754 that G1565 deceiver G4108 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), while he was yet G2089 alive G2198 (PresActPtc), After G3326 three G5140 days G2250 I will rise again G1453 (PresPasInd).
027:064 Command G2753 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767 that the sepulchre G5028 be made sure G0805 (AorPasInf) until G2193 the third G5154 day G2250, lest G3379 his G0846 disciples G3101 come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) by night G3571, and steal G2813 him G0846 away G2813 (AorActSubj), and G2532 say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto the people G2992, He is risen G1453 (AorPasInd) from G0575 the dead G3498: so G2532 the last G2078 error G4106 shall be G2071 (FutInd) worse than G5501 the first G4413.
027:065 G1161 Pilate G4091 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto them G0846, Ye have G2192 (PresActInd) a watch G2892: go your way G5217 (PresActImpr), make [it] as sure G0805 (AorMidDepImpr) as G5613 ye can G1492 (PerfActInd).
027:066 So G1161 they went G4198 (AorPasDepPtc), and made G0805 the sepulchre G5028 sure G0805 (AorMidDepInd), sealing G4972 (AorActPtc) the stone G3037, and setting G3326 a watch G2892.
028:001 ¶  In the end G1161 G3796 of the sabbath G4521, as it began to dawn G2020 (PresActPtc) toward G1519 the first G3391 [day] of the week G4521, came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094 and G2532 the other G0243 Mary G3137 to see G2334 (AorActInf) the sepulchre G5028.
028:002 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 earthquake G4578: for G1063 the angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 descended G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772, and came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and rolled back G0617 (AorActInd) the stone G3037 from G0575 the door G2374, and G2532 sat G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) upon G1883 it G0846.
028:003 G1161 His G0846 countenance G2397 was G2258 (ImpfInd) like G5613 lightning G0796, and G2532 his G0846 raiment G1742 white G3022 as G5616 snow G5510:
028:004 And G1161 for G0575 fear G5401 of him G0846 the keepers G5083 (PresActPtc) did shake G4579 (AorPasInd), and G2532 became G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) as G5616 dead G3498 [men].
028:005 And G1161 the angel G0032 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the women G1135, Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361 ye G5210: for G1063 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 ye seek G2212 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424, which G3588 was crucified G4717 (PerfPasPtc).
028:006 He is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 here G5602: for G1063 he is risen G1453 (AorPasInd), as G2531 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd). Come G1205 (Impr), see G1492 (Aor2ActImpr) the place G5117 where G3699 the Lord G2962 lay G2749 (ImpfMidPasDepInd).
028:007 And G2532 go G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) quickly G5035, and tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) his G0846 disciples G3101 that G3754 he is risen G1453 (AorPasInd) from G0575 the dead G3498; and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), he goeth before G4254 (PresActInd) you G5209 into G1519 Galilee G1056; there G1563 shall ye see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) him G0846: lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I have told G2036 (Aor2ActInd) you G5213.
028:008 And G2532 they departed G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) quickly G5035 from G0575 the sepulchre G3419 with G3326 fear G5401 and G2532 great G3173 joy G5479; and did run G5143 (Aor2ActInd) to bring G0518 his G0846 disciples G3101 word G0518 (AorActInf).
028:009 And G1161 as G5613 they went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to tell G0518 (AorActInf) his G0846 disciples G3101, G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), Jesus G2424 met G0528 (AorActInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), All hail G5463 (PresActImpr). And G1161 they came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and held G2902 (AorActInd) him G0846 by the feet G4228, and G2532 worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) him G0846.
028:010 Then G5119 said G3004 (PresActInd) Jesus G2424 unto them G0846, Be G5399 not G3361 afraid G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr): go G0565 (Aor2ActSubj) tell G0518 (AorActImpr) my G3450 brethren G0080 that G2443 they go G5217 (PresActImpr) into G1519 Galilee G1056, and there G2546 shall they see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165.
028:011 Now G1161 when they G0846 were going G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc), behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), some G5100 of the watch G2892 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the city G4172, and shewed G0518 (AorActInd) unto the chief priests G0749 all the things G0537 that were done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc).
028:012 And G2532 when they were assembled G4863 (AorPasPtc) with G3326 the elders G4245, and G5037 had taken G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) counsel G4824, they gave G1325 (AorActInd) large G2425 money G0694 unto the soldiers G4757,
028:013 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Say ye G2036 (Aor2ActImpr), G3754 His G0846 disciples G3101 came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) by night G3571, and stole G2813 (AorActInd) him G0846 [away] while we G2257 slept G2837 (PresPasPtc).
028:014 And G2532 if G1437 this G5124 come G0191 to G1909 the governor’s G2232 ears G0191 (AorPasSubj), we G2249 will persuade G3982 (FutActInd) him G0846, and G2532 secure G0275 G4160 (FutActInd) you G5209.
028:015 So G1161 they took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the money G0694, and did G4160 (AorActInd) as G5613 they were taught G1321 (AorPasInd): and G2532 this G3778 saying G3056 is commonly reported G1310 (AorPasInd) among G3844 the Jews G2453 until G3360 this day G4594.
028:016 Then G1161 the eleven G1733 disciples G3101 went away G4198 (AorPasDepInd) into G1519 Galilee G1056, into G1519 a mountain G3735 where G3757 Jesus G2424 had appointed G5021 (AorMidInd) them G0846.
028:017 And G2532 when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, they worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) him G0846: but G1161 some doubted G1365 (AorActInd).
028:018 And G2532 Jesus G2424 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and spake G2980 (AorActInd) unto them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), All G3956 power G1849 is given G1325 (AorPasInd) unto me G3427 in G1722 heaven G3772 and G2532 in G1909 earth G1093.
028:019 Go ye G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) therefore G3767, and teach G3100 (AorActImpr) all G3956 nations G1484, baptizing G0907 (PresActPtc) them G0846 in G1519 the name G3686 of the Father G3962, and G2532 of the Son G5207, and G2532 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151:
028:020 Teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) them G0846 to observe G5083 (PresActInf) all things G3956 whatsoever G3745 I have commanded G1781 (AorMidDepInd) you G5213: and G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) with G3326 you G5216 alway G3956 G2250, [even] unto G2193 the end G4930 of the world G0165. Amen G0281.
