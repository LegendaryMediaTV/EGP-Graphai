001:001 ¶  And Solomon H8010 the son H1121 of David H1732 was strengthened H2388 (8691) in his kingdom H4438, and the LORD H3068 his God H0430 [was] with him, and magnified H1431 (8762) him exceedingly H4605.
001:002 Then Solomon H8010 spake H0559 (8799) unto all Israel H3478, to the captains H8269 of thousands H0505 and of hundreds H3967, and to the judges H8199 (8802), and to every governor H5387 in all Israel H3478, the chief H7218 of the fathers H0001.
001:003 So Solomon H8010, and all the congregation H6951 with him, went H3212 (8799) to the high place H1116 that [was] at Gibeon H1391; for there was the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 of God H0430, which Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068 had made H6213 (8804) in the wilderness H4057.
001:004 But H0061 the ark H0727 of God H0430 had David H1732 brought up H5927 (8689) from Kirjathjearim H7157 to [the place which] David H1732 had prepared H3559 (8687) for it: for he had pitched H5186 (8804) a tent H0168 for it at Jerusalem H3389.
001:005 Moreover the brasen H5178 altar H4196, that Bezaleel H1212 the son H1121 of Uri H0221, the son H1121 of Hur H2354, had made H6213 (8804), he put H7760 (8804) before H6440 the tabernacle H4908 of the LORD H3068: and Solomon H8010 and the congregation H6951 sought H1875 (8799) unto it.
001:006 And Solomon H8010 went up H5927 (8686) thither to the brasen H5178 altar H4196 before H6440 the LORD H3068, which [was] at the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and offered H5927 (8686) a thousand H0505 burnt offerings H5930 upon it.
001:007 In that night H3915 did God H0430 appear H7200 (8738) unto Solomon H8010, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Ask H7592 (8798) what I shall give H5414 (8799) thee.
001:008 And Solomon H8010 said H0559 (8799) unto God H0430, Thou hast shewed H6213 (8804) great H1419 mercy H2617 unto David H1732 my father H0001, and hast made me to reign H4427 (8689) in his stead.
001:009 Now, O LORD H3068 God H0430, let thy promise H1697 unto David H1732 my father H0001 be established H0539 (8735): for thou hast made me king H4427 (8689) over a people H5971 like the dust H6083 of the earth H0776 in multitude H7227.
001:010 Give H5414 (8798) me now wisdom H2451 and knowledge H4093, that I may go out H3318 (8799) and come in H0935 (8799) before H6440 this people H5971: for who can judge H8199 (8799) this thy people H5971, [that is so] great H1419?
001:011 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) to Solomon H8010, Because this was in thine heart H3824, and thou hast not asked H7592 (8804) riches H6239, wealth H5233, or honour H3519, nor the life H5315 of thine enemies H8130 (8802), neither yet hast asked H7592 (8804) long H7227 life H3117; but hast asked H7592 (8799) wisdom H2451 and knowledge H4093 for thyself, that thou mayest judge H8199 (8799) my people H5971, over whom I have made thee king H4427 (8689):
001:012 Wisdom H2451 and knowledge H4093 [is] granted H5414 (8803) unto thee; and I will give H5414 (8799) thee riches H6239, and wealth H5233, and honour H3519, such as none of the kings H4428 have had that [have been] before H6440 thee, neither shall there any after H0310 thee have the like.
001:013 Then Solomon H8010 came H0935 (8799) [from his journey] to the high place H1116 that [was] at Gibeon H1391 to Jerusalem H3389, from before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and reigned H4427 (8799) over Israel H3478.
001:014 And Solomon H8010 gathered H0622 (8799) chariots H7393 and horsemen H6571: and he had a thousand H0505 and four H0702 hundred H3967 chariots H7393, and twelve H8147 H6240 thousand H0505 horsemen H6571, which he placed H3240 (8686) in the chariot H7393 cities H5892, and with the king H4428 at Jerusalem H3389.
001:015 And the king H4428 made H5414 (8799) silver H3701 and gold H2091 at Jerusalem H3389 [as plenteous] as stones H0068, and cedar trees H0730 made H5414 (8804) he as the sycomore trees H8256 that [are] in the vale H8219 for abundance H7230.
001:016 And Solomon H8010 had horses H5483 brought H4161 out of Egypt H4714, and linen yarn H4723: the king’s H4428 merchants H5503 (8802) received H3947 (8799) the linen yarn H4723 at a price H4242.
001:017 And they fetched up H5927 (8799), and brought forth H3318 (8686) out of Egypt H4714 a chariot H4818 for six H8337 hundred H3967 [shekels] of silver H3701, and an horse H5483 for an hundred H3967 and fifty H2572: and so brought they out H3318 (8686) [horses] for all the kings H4428 of the Hittites H2850, and for the kings H4428 of Syria H0758, by their means H3027.
002:001 ¶  And Solomon H8010 determined H0559 (8799) to build H1129 (8800) an house H1004 for the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, and an house H1004 for his kingdom H4438.
002:002 And Solomon H8010 told out H5608 (8799) threescore and ten H7657 thousand H0505 men H0376 to bear burdens H5449, and fourscore H8084 thousand H0505 H0376 to hew H2672 (8802) in the mountain H2022, and three H7969 thousand H0505 and six H8337 hundred H3967 to oversee H5329 (8764) them.
002:003 And Solomon H8010 sent H7971 (8799) to Huram H2361 the king H4428 of Tyre H6865, saying H0559 (8800), As thou didst deal H6213 (8804) with David H1732 my father H0001, and didst send H7971 (8799) him cedars H0730 to build H1129 (8800) him an house H1004 to dwell H3427 (8800) therein, [even so deal with me].
002:004 Behold, I build H1129 (8802) an house H1004 to the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 my God H0430, to dedicate H6942 (8687) [it] to him, [and] to burn H6999 (8687) before H6440 him sweet H5561 incense H7004, and for the continual H8548 shewbread H4635, and for the burnt offerings H5930 morning H1242 and evening H6153, on the sabbaths H7676, and on the new moons H2320, and on the solemn feasts H4150 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430. This [is an ordinance] for ever H5769 to Israel H3478.
002:005 And the house H1004 which I build H1129 (8802) [is] great H1419: for great H1419 [is] our God H0430 above all gods H0430.
002:006 But who is able H6113 (8799) H3581 to build H1129 (8800) him an house H1004, seeing the heaven H8064 and heaven H8064 of heavens H8064 cannot contain H3557 (8770) him? who [am] I then, that I should build H1129 (8799) him an house H1004, save only H0518 to burn sacrifice H6999 (8687) before H6440 him?
002:007 Send H7971 (8798) me now therefore a man H0376 cunning H2450 to work H6213 (8800) in gold H2091, and in silver H3701, and in brass H5178, and in iron H1270, and in purple H0710, and crimson H3758, and blue H8504, and that can skill H3045 (8802) to grave H6605 (8763) H6603 with the cunning men H2450 that [are] with me in Judah H3063 and in Jerusalem H3389, whom David H1732 my father H0001 did provide H3559 (8689).
002:008 Send H7971 (8798) me also cedar H0730 trees H6086, fir trees H1265, and algum trees H0418, out of Lebanon H3844: for I know H3045 (8804) that thy servants H5650 can skill H3045 (8802) to cut H3772 (8800) timber H6086 in Lebanon H3844; and, behold, my servants H5650 [shall be] with thy servants H5650,
002:009 Even to prepare H3559 (8687) me timber H6086 in abundance H7230: for the house H1004 which I am about to build H1129 (8802) [shall be] wonderful H6381 (8687) great H1419.
002:010 And, behold, I will give H5414 (8804) to thy servants H5650, the hewers H2404 (8802) that cut H3772 (8802) timber H6086, twenty H6242 thousand H0505 measures H3734 of beaten H4347 wheat H2406, and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 measures H3734 of barley H8184, and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 baths H1324 of wine H3196, and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 baths H1324 of oil H8081.
002:011 Then Huram H2361 the king H4428 of Tyre H6865 answered H0559 (8799) in writing H3791, which he sent H7971 (8799) to Solomon H8010, Because the LORD H3068 hath loved H0160 his people H5971, he hath made H5414 (8804) thee king H4428 over them.
002:012 Huram H2361 said H0559 (8799) moreover, Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, that made H6213 (8804) heaven H8064 and earth H0776, who hath given H5414 (8804) to David H1732 the king H4428 a wise H2450 son H1121, endued H3045 (8802) with prudence H7922 and understanding H0998, that might build H1129 (8799) an house H1004 for the LORD H3068, and an house H1004 for his kingdom H4438.
002:013 And now I have sent H7971 (8804) a cunning H2450 man H0376, endued H3045 (8802) with understanding H0998, of Huram H2361 my father’s H0001,
002:014 The son H1121 of a woman H0802 of the daughters H1323 of Dan H1835, and his father H0001 [was] a man H0376 of Tyre H6876, skilful H3045 (8802) to work H6213 (8800) in gold H2091, and in silver H3701, in brass H5178, in iron H1270, in stone H0068, and in timber H6086, in purple H0713, in blue H8504, and in fine linen H0948, and in crimson H3758; also to grave H6605 (8763) any manner of graving H6603, and to find out H2803 (8800) every device H4284 which shall be put H5414 (8735) to him, with thy cunning men H2450, and with the cunning men H2450 of my lord H0113 David H1732 thy father H0001.
002:015 Now therefore the wheat H2406, and the barley H8184, the oil H8081, and the wine H3196, which my lord H0113 hath spoken H0559 (8804) of, let him send H7971 (8799) unto his servants H5650:
002:016 And we will cut H3772 (8799) wood H6086 out of Lebanon H3844, as much as thou shalt need H6878: and we will bring H0935 (8686) it to thee in floats H7513 by sea H3220 to Joppa H3305; and thou shalt carry it up H5927 (8686) to Jerusalem H3389.
002:017 And Solomon H8010 numbered H5608 (8799) all the strangers H0582 H1616 that [were] in the land H0776 of Israel H3478, after H0310 the numbering H5610 wherewith David H1732 his father H0001 had numbered H5608 (8804) them; and they were found H4672 (8735) an hundred H3967 and fifty H2572 thousand H0505 and three H7969 thousand H0505 and six H8337 hundred H3967.
002:018 And he set H6213 (8799) threescore and ten H7657 thousand H0505 of them [to be] bearers of burdens H5449, and fourscore H8084 thousand H0505 [to be] hewers H2672 (8802) in the mountain H2022, and three H7969 thousand H0505 and six H8337 hundred H3967 overseers H5329 (8764) to set H5647 the people H5971 a work H5647 (8687).
003:001 ¶  Then Solomon H8010 began H2490 (8686) to build H1129 (8800) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 at Jerusalem H3389 in mount H2022 Moriah H4179, where [the LORD] appeared H7200 (8738) unto David H1732 his father H0001, in the place H4725 that David H1732 had prepared H3559 (8689) in the threshingfloor H1637 of Ornan H0771 the Jebusite H2983.
003:002 And he began H2490 (8686) to build H1129 (8800) in the second H8145 [day] of the second H8145 month H2320, in the fourth H0702 year H8141 of his reign H4438.
003:003 Now these [are the things wherein] Solomon H8010 was instructed H3245 (8717) for the building H1129 (8800) of the house H1004 of God H0430. The length H0753 by cubits H0520 after the first H7223 measure H4060 [was] threescore H8346 cubits H0520, and the breadth H7341 twenty H6242 cubits H0520.
003:004 And the porch H0197 that [was] in the front H6440 [of the house], the length H0753 [of it was] according to the breadth H7341 of the house H1004, twenty H6242 cubits H0520, and the height H1363 [was] an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242: and he overlaid H6823 (8762) it within H6441 with pure H2889 gold H2091.
003:005 And the greater H1419 house H1004 he cieled H2645 (8765) with fir H1265 tree H6086, which he overlaid H2645 (8762) with fine H2896 gold H2091, and set H5927 (8686) thereon palm trees H8561 and chains H8333.
003:006 And he garnished H6823 (8762) the house H1004 with precious H3368 stones H0068 for beauty H8597: and the gold H2091 [was] gold H2091 of Parvaim H6516.
003:007 He overlaid H2645 (8762) also the house H1004, the beams H6982, the posts H5592, and the walls H7023 thereof, and the doors H1817 thereof, with gold H2091; and graved H6605 (8765) cherubims H3742 on the walls H7023.
003:008 And he made H6213 (8799) the most H6944 holy H6944 house H1004, the length H0753 whereof [was] according to H6440 the breadth H7341 of the house H1004, twenty H6242 cubits H0520, and the breadth H7341 thereof twenty H6242 cubits H0520: and he overlaid H2645 (8762) it with fine H2896 gold H2091, [amounting] to six H8337 hundred H3967 talents H3603.
003:009 And the weight H4948 of the nails H4548 [was] fifty H2572 shekels H8255 of gold H2091. And he overlaid H2645 (8765) the upper chambers H5944 with gold H2091.
003:010 And in the most H6944 holy H6944 house H1004 he made H6213 (8799) two H8147 cherubims H3742 of image H6816 work H4639, and overlaid H6823 (8762) them with gold H2091.
003:011 And the wings H3671 of the cherubims H3742 [were] twenty H6242 cubits H0520 long H0753: one H0259 wing H3671 [of the one cherub was] five H2568 cubits H0520, reaching H5060 (8688) to the wall H7023 of the house H1004: and the other H0312 wing H3671 [was likewise] five H2568 cubits H0520, reaching H5060 (8688) to the wing H3671 of the other H0312 cherub H3742.
003:012 And [one] wing H3671 of the other H0259 cherub H3742 [was] five H2568 cubits H0520, reaching H5060 (8688) to the wall H7023 of the house H1004: and the other H0312 wing H3671 [was] five H2568 cubits H0520 [also], joining H1695 to the wing H3671 of the other H0312 cherub H3742.
003:013 The wings H3671 of these cherubims H3742 spread themselves forth H6566 (8802) twenty H6242 cubits H0520: and they stood H5975 (8802) on their feet H7272, and their faces H6440 [were] inward H1004.
003:014 And he made H6213 (8799) the vail H6532 [of] blue H8504, and purple H0713, and crimson H3758, and fine linen H0948, and wrought H5927 (8686) cherubims H3742 thereon.
003:015 Also he made H6213 (8799) before H6440 the house H1004 two H8147 pillars H5982 of thirty H7970 and five H2568 cubits H0520 high H0753, and the chapiter H6858 that [was] on the top H7218 of each of them [was] five H2568 cubits H0520.
003:016 And he made H6213 (8799) chains H8333, [as] in the oracle H1687, and put H5414 (8799) [them] on the heads H7218 of the pillars H5982; and made H6213 (8799) an hundred H3967 pomegranates H7416, and put H5414 (8799) [them] on the chains H8333.
003:017 And he reared up H6965 (8686) the pillars H5982 before H6440 the temple H1964, one H0259 on the right hand H3225, and the other H0259 on the left H8040; and called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of that on the right hand H3233 (8675) H3227 Jachin H3199, and the name H8034 of that on the left H8042 Boaz H1162.
004:001 ¶  Moreover he made H6213 (8799) an altar H4196 of brass H5178, twenty H6242 cubits H0520 the length H0753 thereof, and twenty H6242 cubits H0520 the breadth H7341 thereof, and ten H6235 cubits H0520 the height H6967 thereof.
004:002 Also he made H6213 (8799) a molten H3332 (8716) sea H3220 of ten H6235 cubits H0520 from brim H8193 to brim H8193, round H5696 in compass H5439, and five H2568 cubits H0520 the height H6967 thereof; and a line H6957 of thirty H7970 cubits H0520 did compass H5437 (8799) it round about H5439.
004:003 And under it [was] the similitude H1823 of oxen H1241, which did compass H5437 (8802) it round about H5439: ten H6235 in a cubit H0520, compassing H5362 (8688) the sea H3220 round about H5439. Two H8147 rows H2905 of oxen H1241 [were] cast H3332 (8803), when it was cast H4166.
004:004 It stood H5975 (8802) upon twelve H8147 H6240 oxen H1241, three H7969 looking H6437 (8802) toward the north H6828, and three H7969 looking H6437 (8802) toward the west H3220, and three H7969 looking H6437 (8802) toward the south H5045, and three H7969 looking H6437 (8802) toward the east H4217: and the sea H3220 [was set] above H4605 upon them, and all their hinder parts H0268 [were] inward H1004.
004:005 And the thickness H5672 of it [was] an handbreadth H2947, and the brim H8193 of it like the work H4639 of the brim H8193 of a cup H3563, with flowers H6525 of lilies H7799; [and] it received H2388 (8688) and held H3557 (8686) three H7969 thousand H0505 baths H1324.
004:006 He made H6213 (8799) also ten H6235 lavers H3595, and put H5414 (8799) five H2568 on the right hand H3225, and five H2568 on the left H8040, to wash H7364 (8800) in them: such things as they offered H4639 for the burnt offering H5930 they washed H1740 (8686) in them; but the sea H3220 [was] for the priests H3548 to wash in H7364 (8800).
004:007 And he made H6213 (8799) ten H6235 candlesticks H4501 of gold H2091 according to their form H4941, and set H5414 (8799) [them] in the temple H1964, five H2568 on the right hand H3225, and five H2568 on the left H8040.
004:008 He made H6213 (8799) also ten H6235 tables H7979, and placed H3240 (8686) [them] in the temple H1964, five H2568 on the right side H3225, and five H2568 on the left H8040. And he made H6213 (8799) an hundred H3967 basons H4219 of gold H2091.
004:009 Furthermore he made H6213 (8799) the court H2691 of the priests H3548, and the great H1419 court H5835, and doors H1817 for the court H5835, and overlaid H6823 (8765) the doors H1817 of them with brass H5178.
004:010 And he set H5414 (8804) the sea H3220 on the right H3233 side H3802 of the east end H6924, over against H4136 the south H5045.
004:011 And Huram H2361 made H6213 (8799) the pots H5518, and the shovels H3257, and the basons H4219. And Huram H2361 (8676) H2438 finished H3615 (8762) H6213 (8800) the work H4399 that he was to make H6213 (8804) for king H4428 Solomon H8010 for the house H1004 of God H0430;
004:012 [To wit], the two H8147 pillars H5982, and the pommels H1543, and the chapiters H3805 [which were] on the top H7218 of the two pillars H5982, and the two H8147 wreaths H7639 to cover H3680 (8763) the two H8147 pommels H1543 of the chapiters H3805 which [were] on the top H7218 of the pillars H5982;
004:013 And four H0702 hundred H3967 pomegranates H7416 on the two H8147 wreaths H7639; two H8147 rows H2905 of pomegranates H7416 on each H0259 wreath H7639, to cover H3680 (8763) the two H8147 pommels H1543 of the chapiters H3805 which [were] upon H6440 the pillars H5982.
004:014 He made H6213 (8804) also bases H4350, and lavers H3595 made H6213 (8804) he upon the bases H4350;
004:015 One H0259 sea H3220, and twelve H8147 H6240 oxen H1241 under it.
004:016 The pots H5518 also, and the shovels H3257, and the fleshhooks H4207, and all their instruments H3627, did Huram H2361 his father H0001 make H6213 (8804) to king H4428 Solomon H8010 for the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 of bright H4838 (8803) brass H5178.
004:017 In the plain H3603 of Jordan H3383 did the king H4428 cast H3332 (8804) them, in the clay H5645 ground H0127 between Succoth H5523 and Zeredathah H6868.
004:018 Thus Solomon H8010 made H6213 (8799) all these vessels H3627 in great H3966 abundance H7230: for the weight H4948 of the brass H5178 could not be found out H2713 (8738).
004:019 And Solomon H8010 made H6213 (8799) all the vessels H3627 that [were for] the house H1004 of God H0430, the golden H2091 altar H4196 also, and the tables H7979 whereon the shewbread H3899 H6440 [was set];
004:020 Moreover the candlesticks H4501 with their lamps H5216, that they should burn H1197 (8763) after the manner H4941 before H6440 the oracle H1687, of pure H5462 (8803) gold H2091;
004:021 And the flowers H6525, and the lamps H5216, and the tongs H4457, [made he of] gold H2091, [and] that perfect H4357 gold H2091;
004:022 And the snuffers H4212, and the basons H4219, and the spoons H3709, and the censers H4289, [of] pure H5462 (8803) gold H2091: and the entry H6607 of the house H1004, the inner H6442 doors H1817 thereof for the most H6944 holy H6944 [place], and the doors H1817 of the house H1004 of the temple H1964, [were of] gold H2091.
005:001 ¶  Thus all the work H4399 that Solomon H8010 made H6213 (8804) for the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 was finished H7999 (8799): and Solomon H8010 brought H0935 (8686) in [all] the things H6944 that David H1732 his father H0001 had dedicated H6944; and the silver H3701, and the gold H2091, and all the instruments H3627, put H5414 (8804) he among the treasures H0214 of the house H1004 of God H0430.
005:002 Then Solomon H8010 assembled H6950 (8686) the elders H2205 of Israel H3478, and all the heads H7218 of the tribes H4294, the chief H5387 of the fathers H0001 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, unto Jerusalem H3389, to bring up H5927 (8687) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 out of the city H5892 of David H1732, which [is] Zion H6726.
005:003 Wherefore all the men H0376 of Israel H3478 assembled H6950 (8735) themselves unto the king H4428 in the feast H2282 which [was] in the seventh H7637 month H2320.
005:004 And all the elders H2205 of Israel H3478 came H0935 (8799); and the Levites H3881 took up H5375 (8799) the ark H0727.
005:005 And they brought up H5927 (8686) the ark H0727, and the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and all the holy H6944 vessels H3627 that [were] in the tabernacle H0168, these did the priests H3548 [and] the Levites H3881 bring up H5927 (8689).
005:006 Also king H4428 Solomon H8010, and all the congregation H5712 of Israel H3478 that were assembled H3259 (8737) unto him before H6440 the ark H0727, sacrificed H2076 (8764) sheep H6629 and oxen H1241, which could not be told H5608 (8735) nor numbered H4487 (8735) for multitude H7230.
005:007 And the priests H3548 brought in H0935 (8686) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 unto his place H4725, to the oracle H1687 of the house H1004, into the most H6944 holy H6944 [place, even] under the wings H3671 of the cherubims H3742:
005:008 For the cherubims H3742 spread forth H6566 (8802) [their] wings H3671 over the place H4725 of the ark H0727, and the cherubims H3742 covered H3680 (8762) the ark H0727 and the staves H0905 thereof above H4605.
005:009 And they drew out H0748 (8686) the staves H0905 [of the ark], that the ends H7218 of the staves H0905 were seen H7200 (8735) from the ark H0727 before H6440 the oracle H1687; but they were not seen H7200 (8735) without H2351. And there it is unto this day H3117.
005:010 [There was] nothing in the ark H0727 save the two H8147 tables H3871 which Moses H4872 put H5414 (8804) [therein] at Horeb H2722, when the LORD H3068 made H3772 (8804) [a covenant] with the children H1121 of Israel H3478, when they came out H3318 (8800) of Egypt H4714.
005:011 And it came to pass, when the priests H3548 were come out H3318 (8800) of the holy H6944 [place]: (for all the priests H3548 [that were] present H4672 (8737) were sanctified H6942 (8694), [and] did not [then] wait H8104 (8800) by course H4256:
005:012 Also the Levites H3881 [which were] the singers H7891 (8789), all of them of Asaph H0623, of Heman H1968, of Jeduthun H3038, with their sons H1121 and their brethren H0251, [being] arrayed H3847 (8794) in white linen H0948, having cymbals H4700 and psalteries H5035 and harps H3658, stood H5975 (8802) at the east end H4217 of the altar H4196, and with them an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242 priests H3548 sounding H2690 (8688) with trumpets H2689:)
005:013 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters H2690 (8764) (8675) H2690 (8764) and singers H7891 (8789) [were] as one H0259, to make one H0259 sound H6963 to be heard H8085 (8687) in praising H1984 (8763) and thanking H3034 (8687) the LORD H3068; and when they lifted up H7311 (8687) [their] voice H6963 with the trumpets H2689 and cymbals H4700 and instruments H3627 of musick H7892, and praised H1984 (8763) the LORD H3068, [saying], For [he is] good H2896; for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769: that [then] the house H1004 was filled H4390 (8804) with a cloud H6051, [even] the house H1004 of the LORD H3068;
005:014 So that the priests H3548 could H3201 (8804) not stand H5975 (8800) to minister H8334 (8763) by reason H6440 of the cloud H6051: for the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 had filled H4390 (8804) the house H1004 of God H0430.
006:001 ¶  Then said H0559 (8804) Solomon H8010, The LORD H3068 hath said H0559 (8804) that he would dwell H7931 (8800) in the thick darkness H6205.
006:002 But I have built H1129 (8804) an house H1004 of habitation H2073 for thee, and a place H4349 for thy dwelling H3427 (8800) for ever H5769.
006:003 And the king H4428 turned H5437 (8686) his face H6440, and blessed H1288 (8762) the whole congregation H6951 of Israel H3478: and all the congregation H6951 of Israel H3478 stood H5975 (8802).
006:004 And he said H0559 (8799), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, who hath with his hands H3027 fulfilled H4390 (8765) [that] which he spake H1696 (8765) with his mouth H6310 to my father H0001 David H1732, saying H0559 (8800),
006:005 Since the day H3117 that I brought forth H3318 (8689) my people H5971 out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 I chose H0977 (8804) no city H5892 among all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 to build H1129 (8800) an house H1004 in, that my name H8034 might be there; neither chose H0977 (8804) I any man H0376 to be a ruler H5057 over my people H5971 Israel H3478:
006:006 But I have chosen H0977 (8799) Jerusalem H3389, that my name H8034 might be there; and have chosen H0977 (8799) David H1732 to be over my people H5971 Israel H3478.
006:007 Now it was in the heart H3824 of David H1732 my father H0001 to build H1129 (8800) an house H1004 for the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
006:008 But the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732 my father H0001, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart H3824 to build H1129 (8800) an house H1004 for my name H8034, thou didst well H2895 (8689) in that it was in thine heart H3824:
006:009 Notwithstanding H7535 thou shalt not build H1129 (8799) the house H1004; but thy son H1121 which shall come forth H3318 (8802) out of thy loins H2504, he shall build H1129 (8799) the house H1004 for my name H8034.
006:010 The LORD H3068 therefore hath performed H6965 (8686) his word H1697 that he hath spoken H1696 (8765): for I am risen up H6965 (8799) in the room of David H1732 my father H0001, and am set H3427 (8799) on the throne H3678 of Israel H3478, as the LORD H3068 promised H1696 (8765), and have built H1129 (8799) the house H1004 for the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
006:011 And in it H8033 have I put H7760 (8799) the ark H0727, wherein [is] the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, that he made H3772 (8804) with the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
006:012 And he stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068 in the presence of all the congregation H6951 of Israel H3478, and spread forth H6566 (8799) his hands H3709:
006:013 For Solomon H8010 had made H6213 (8804) a brasen H5178 scaffold H3595, of five H2568 cubits H0520 long H0753, and five H2568 cubits H0520 broad H7341, and three H7969 cubits H0520 high H6967, and had set H5414 (8799) it in the midst H8432 of the court H5835: and upon it he stood H5975 (8799), and kneeled down H1288 (8799) upon his knees H1290 before all the congregation H6951 of Israel H3478, and spread forth H6566 (8799) his hands H3709 toward heaven H8064,
006:014 And said H0559 (8799), O LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, [there is] no God H0430 like thee in the heaven H8064, nor in the earth H0776; which keepest H8104 (8802) covenant H1285, and [shewest] mercy H2617 unto thy servants H5650, that walk H1980 (8802) before H6440 thee with all their hearts H3820:
006:015 Thou which hast kept H8104 (8804) with thy servant H5650 David H1732 my father H0001 that which thou hast promised H1696 (8765) him; and spakest H1696 (8762) with thy mouth H6310, and hast fulfilled H4390 (8765) [it] with thine hand H3027, as [it is] this day H3117.
006:016 Now therefore, O LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, keep H8104 (8798) with thy servant H5650 David H1732 my father H0001 that which thou hast promised H1696 (8765) him, saying H0559 (8800), There shall not fail H3772 (8735) thee a man H0376 in my sight H6440 to sit H3427 (8802) upon the throne H3678 of Israel H3478; yet so H7535 that thy children H1121 take heed H8104 (8799) to their way H1870 to walk H3212 (8800) in my law H8451, as thou hast walked H1980 (8804) before H6440 me.
006:017 Now then, O LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, let thy word H1697 be verified H0539 (8735), which thou hast spoken H1696 (8765) unto thy servant H5650 David H1732.
006:018 But will God H0430 in very deed H0552 dwell H3427 (8799) with men H0120 on the earth H0776? behold, heaven H8064 and the heaven H8064 of heavens H8064 cannot contain H3557 (8770) thee; how much less this house H1004 which I have built H1129 (8804)!
006:019 Have respect H6437 (8804) therefore to the prayer H8605 of thy servant H5650, and to his supplication H8467, O LORD H3068 my God H0430, to hearken H8085 (8800) unto the cry H7440 and the prayer H8605 which thy servant H5650 prayeth H6419 (8693) before H6440 thee:
006:020 That thine eyes H5869 may be open H6605 (8803) upon this house H1004 day H3119 and night H3915, upon the place H4725 whereof thou hast said H0559 (8804) that thou wouldest put H7760 (8800) thy name H8034 there; to hearken H8085 (8800) unto the prayer H8605 which thy servant H5650 prayeth H6419 (8691) toward this place H4725.
006:021 Hearken H8085 (8804) therefore unto the supplications H8469 of thy servant H5650, and of thy people H5971 Israel H3478, which they shall make H6419 (8691) toward this place H4725: hear H8085 (8799) thou from thy dwelling H3427 (8800) place H4725, [even] from heaven H8064; and when thou hearest H8085 (8804), forgive H5545 (8804).
006:022 If a man H0376 sin H2398 (8799) against his neighbour H7453, and an oath H0423 be laid H5375 (8804) upon him to make him swear H0422 (8687), and the oath H0423 come H0935 (8804) before H6440 thine altar H4196 in this house H1004;
006:023 Then hear H8085 (8799) thou from heaven H8064, and do H6213 (8804), and judge H8199 (8804) thy servants H5650, by requiting H7725 (8687) the wicked H7563, by recompensing H5414 (8800) his way H1870 upon his own head H7218; and by justifying H6663 (8687) the righteous H6662, by giving H5414 (8800) him according to his righteousness H6666.
006:024 And if thy people H5971 Israel H3478 be put to the worse H5062 (8735) before H6440 the enemy H0341 (8802), because they have sinned H2398 (8799) against thee; and shall return H7725 (8804) and confess H3034 (8689) thy name H8034, and pray H6419 (8694) and make supplication H2603 (8694) before H6440 thee in this house H1004;
006:025 Then hear H8085 (8799) thou from the heavens H8064, and forgive H5545 (8804) the sin H2403 of thy people H5971 Israel H3478, and bring them again H7725 (8689) unto the land H0127 which thou gavest H5414 (8804) to them and to their fathers H0001.
006:026 When the heaven H8064 is shut up H6113 (8736), and there is no rain H4306, because they have sinned H2398 (8799) against thee; [yet] if they pray H6419 (8694) toward this place H4725, and confess H3034 (8689) thy name H8034, and turn H7725 (8799) from their sin H2403, when thou dost afflict H6031 (8686) them;
006:027 Then hear H8085 (8799) thou from heaven H8064, and forgive H5545 (8804) the sin H2403 of thy servants H5650, and of thy people H5971 Israel H3478, when thou hast taught H3384 (8686) them the good H2896 way H1870, wherein they should walk H3212 (8799); and send H5414 (8804) rain H4306 upon thy land H0776, which thou hast given H5414 (8804) unto thy people H5971 for an inheritance H5159.
006:028 If there be dearth H7458 in the land H0776, if there be pestilence H1698, if there be blasting H7711, or mildew H3420, locusts H0697, or caterpillers H2625; if their enemies H0341 (8802) besiege H6887 (8686) them in the cities H8179 of their land H0776; whatsoever sore H5061 or whatsoever sickness H4245 [there be]:
006:029 [Then] what prayer H8605 [or] what supplication H8467 soever shall be made of any man H0120, or of all thy people H5971 Israel H3478, when every one H0376 shall know H3045 (8799) his own sore H5061 and his own grief H4341, and shall spread forth H6566 (8804) his hands H3709 in this house H1004:
006:030 Then hear H8085 (8799) thou from heaven H8064 thy dwelling H3427 (8800) place H4349, and forgive H5545 (8804), and render H5414 (8804) unto every man H0376 according unto all his ways H1870, whose heart H3824 thou knowest H3045 (8799); (for thou only knowest H3045 (8804) the hearts H3824 of the children H1121 of men H0120:)
006:031 That they may fear H3372 (8799) thee, to walk H3212 (8800) in thy ways H1870, so long as H3117 they live H2416 H6440 in the land H0127 which thou gavest H5414 (8804) unto our fathers H0001.
006:032 Moreover concerning the stranger H5237, which is not of thy people H5971 Israel H3478, but is come H0935 (8804) from a far H7350 country H0776 for thy great H1419 name’s H8034 sake, and thy mighty H2389 hand H3027, and thy stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220; if they come H0935 (8804) and pray H6419 (8694) in this house H1004;
006:033 Then hear H8085 (8799) thou from the heavens H8064, [even] from thy dwelling H3427 (8800) place H4349, and do H6213 (8804) according to all that the stranger H5237 calleth H7121 (8799) to thee for; that all people H5971 of the earth H0776 may know H3045 (8799) thy name H8034, and fear H3372 (8800) thee, as [doth] thy people H5971 Israel H3478, and may know H3045 (8800) that this house H1004 which I have built H1129 (8804) is called H7121 (8738) by thy name H8034.
006:034 If thy people H5971 go out H3318 (8799) to war H4421 against their enemies H0341 (8802) by the way H1870 that thou shalt send H7971 (8799) them, and they pray H6419 (8694) unto thee toward H1870 this city H5892 which thou hast chosen H0977 (8804), and the house H1004 which I have built H1129 (8804) for thy name H8034;
006:035 Then hear H8085 (8804) thou from the heavens H8064 their prayer H8605 and their supplication H8467, and maintain H6213 (8804) their cause H4941.
006:036 If they sin H2398 (8799) against thee, (for [there is] no man H0120 which sinneth H2398 (8799) not,) and thou be angry H0599 (8804) with them, and deliver H5414 (8804) them over before H6440 [their] enemies H0341 (8802), and they carry them away H7617 (8804) captives H7617 (8802) unto a land H0776 far off H7350 or near H7138;
006:037 Yet [if] they bethink H7725 (8689) H3824 themselves in the land H0776 whither they are carried captive H7617 (8738), and turn H7725 (8804) and pray H2603 (8694) unto thee in the land H0776 of their captivity H7628, saying H0559 (8800), We have sinned H2398 (8804), we have done amiss H5753 (8689), and have dealt wickedly H7561 (8804);
006:038 If they return H7725 (8804) to thee with all their heart H3820 and with all their soul H5315 in the land H0776 of their captivity H7628, whither they have carried them captives H7617 (8804), and pray H6419 (8694) toward H1870 their land H0776, which thou gavest H5414 (8804) unto their fathers H0001, and [toward] the city H5892 which thou hast chosen H0977 (8804), and toward the house H1004 which I have built H1129 (8804) for thy name H8034:
006:039 Then hear H8085 (8804) thou from the heavens H8064, [even] from thy dwelling H3427 (8800) place H4349, their prayer H8605 and their supplications H8467, and maintain H6213 (8804) their cause H4941, and forgive H5545 (8804) thy people H5971 which have sinned H2398 (8804) against thee.
006:040 Now, my God H0430, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes H5869 be open H6605 (8803), and [let] thine ears H0241 [be] attent H7183 unto the prayer H8605 [that is made] in this place H4725.
006:041 Now therefore arise H6965 (8798), O LORD H3068 God H0430, into thy resting H5118 place, thou, and the ark H0727 of thy strength H5797: let thy priests H3548, O LORD H3068 God H0430, be clothed H3847 (8799) with salvation H8668, and let thy saints H2623 rejoice H8055 (8799) in goodness H2896.
006:042 O LORD H3068 God H0430, turn not away H7725 (8686) the face H6440 of thine anointed H4899: remember H2142 (8798) the mercies H2617 of David H1732 thy servant H5650.
007:001 ¶  Now when Solomon H8010 had made an end H3615 (8763) of praying H6419 (8692), the fire H0784 came down H3381 (8804) from heaven H8064, and consumed H0398 (8799) the burnt offering H5930 and the sacrifices H2077; and the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 filled H4390 (8804) the house H1004.
007:002 And the priests H3548 could H3201 (8804) not enter H0935 (8800) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, because the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 had filled H4390 (8804) the LORD’S H3068 house H1004.
007:003 And when all the children H1121 of Israel H3478 saw H7200 (8802) how the fire H0784 came down H3381 (8800), and the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 upon the house H1004, they bowed H3766 (8799) themselves with their faces H0639 to the ground H0776 upon the pavement H7531, and worshipped H7812 (8691), and praised H3034 (8687) the LORD H3068, [saying], For [he is] good H2896; for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
007:004 Then the king H4428 and all the people H5971 offered H2076 (8802) sacrifices H2077 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
007:005 And king H4428 Solomon H8010 offered H2076 (8799) a sacrifice H2077 of twenty H6242 and two H8147 thousand H0505 oxen H1241, and an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 sheep H6629: so the king H4428 and all the people H5971 dedicated H2596 (8799) the house H1004 of God H0430.
007:006 And the priests H3548 waited H5975 (8802) on their offices H4931: the Levites H3881 also with instruments H3627 of musick H7892 of the LORD H3068, which David H1732 the king H4428 had made H6213 (8804) to praise H3034 (8687) the LORD H3068, because his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769, when David H1732 praised H1984 (8763) by their ministry H3027; and the priests H3548 sounded trumpets H2690 (8688) (8675) H2690 (8764) before them, and all Israel H3478 stood H5975 (8802).
007:007 Moreover Solomon H8010 hallowed H6942 (8762) the middle H8432 of the court H2691 that [was] before H6440 the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: for there he offered H6213 (8804) burnt offerings H5930, and the fat H2459 of the peace offerings H8002, because the brasen H5178 altar H4196 which Solomon H8010 had made H6213 (8804) was not able H3201 (8804) to receive H3557 (8687) the burnt offerings H5930, and the meat offerings H4503, and the fat H2459.
007:008 Also at the same time H6256 Solomon H8010 kept H6213 (8799) the feast H2282 seven H7651 days H3117, and all Israel H3478 with him, a very H3966 great H1419 congregation H6951, from the entering in H0935 (8800) of Hamath H2574 unto the river H5158 of Egypt H4714.
007:009 And in the eighth H8066 day H3117 they made H6213 (8799) a solemn assembly H6116: for they kept H6213 (8804) the dedication H2598 of the altar H4196 seven H7651 days H3117, and the feast H2282 seven H7651 days H3117.
007:010 And on the three H7969 and twentieth H6242 day H3117 of the seventh H7637 month H2320 he sent H7971 the people H5971 away H7971 (8765) into their tents H0168, glad H8056 and merry H2896 in heart H3820 for the goodness H2896 that the LORD H3068 had shewed H6213 (8804) unto David H1732, and to Solomon H8010, and to Israel H3478 his people H5971.
007:011 Thus Solomon H8010 finished H3615 (8762) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and the king’s H4428 house H1004: and all that came H0935 (8802) into Solomon’s H8010 heart H3820 to make H6213 (8800) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and in his own house H1004, he prosperously effected H6743 (8689).
007:012 And the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) to Solomon H8010 by night H3915, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, I have heard H8085 (8804) thy prayer H8605, and have chosen H0977 (8804) this place H4725 to myself for an house H1004 of sacrifice H2077.
007:013 If H2005 I shut up H6113 (8799) heaven H8064 that there be no rain H4306, or if I command H6680 (8762) the locusts H2284 to devour H0398 (8800) the land H0776, or if I send H7971 (8762) pestilence H1698 among my people H5971;
007:014 If my people H5971, which are called H7121 (8738) by my name H8034, shall humble H3665 (8735) themselves, and pray H6419 (8691), and seek H1245 (8762) my face H6440, and turn H7725 (8799) from their wicked H7451 ways H1870; then will I hear H8085 (8799) from heaven H8064, and will forgive H5545 (8799) their sin H2403, and will heal H7495 (8799) their land H0776.
007:015 Now mine eyes H5869 shall be open H6605 (8803), and mine ears H0241 attent H7183 unto the prayer H8605 [that is made] in this place H4725.
007:016 For now have I chosen H0977 (8804) and sanctified H6942 (8689) this house H1004, that my name H8034 may be there for H5704 ever H5769: and mine eyes H5869 and mine heart H3820 shall be there perpetually H3117.
007:017 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk H3212 (8799) before H6440 me, as David H1732 thy father H0001 walked H1980 (8804), and do H6213 (8800) according to all that I have commanded H6680 (8765) thee, and shalt observe H8104 (8799) my statutes H2706 and my judgments H4941;
007:018 Then will I stablish H6965 (8689) the throne H3678 of thy kingdom H4438, according as I have covenanted H3772 (8804) with David H1732 thy father H0001, saying H0559 (8800), There shall not fail H3772 (8735) thee a man H0376 [to be] ruler H4910 (8802) in Israel H3478.
007:019 But if ye turn away H7725 (8799), and forsake H5800 (8804) my statutes H2708 and my commandments H4687, which I have set H5414 (8804) before H6440 you, and shall go H1980 (8804) and serve H5647 (8804) other H0312 gods H0430, and worship H7812 (8694) them;
007:020 Then will I pluck them up by the roots H5428 (8804) out of my land H0127 which I have given H5414 (8804) them; and this house H1004, which I have sanctified H6942 (8689) for my name H8034, will I cast out H7993 (8686) of my sight H6440, and will make H5414 (8799) it [to be] a proverb H4912 and a byword H8148 among all nations H5971.
007:021 And this house H1004, which is high H5945, shall be an astonishment H8074 (8799) to every one that passeth H5674 (8802) by it; so that he shall say H0559 (8804), Why hath the LORD H3068 done H6213 (8804) thus unto this land H0776, and unto this house H1004?
007:022 And it shall be answered H0559 (8804), Because they forsook H5800 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001, which brought them forth H3318 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and laid hold H2388 (8686) on other H0312 gods H0430, and worshipped H7812 (8691) them, and served H5647 (8799) them: therefore hath he brought H0935 (8689) all this evil H7451 upon them.
008:001 ¶  And it came to pass at the end H7093 of twenty H6242 years H8141, wherein Solomon H8010 had built H1129 (8804) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and his own house H1004,
008:002 That the cities H5892 which Huram H2361 had restored H5414 (8804) to Solomon H8010, Solomon H8010 built H1129 (8804) them, and caused the children H1121 of Israel H3478 to dwell H3427 (8686) there.
008:003 And Solomon H8010 went H3212 (8799) to Hamathzobah H2578, and prevailed H2388 (8799) against it.
008:004 And he built H1129 (8799) Tadmor H8412 in the wilderness H4057, and all the store H4543 cities H5892, which he built H1129 (8804) in Hamath H2574.
008:005 Also he built H1129 (8799) Bethhoron H1032 the upper H5945, and Bethhoron H1032 the nether H8481, fenced H4692 cities H5892, with walls H2346, gates H1817, and bars H1280;
008:006 And Baalath H1191, and all the store H4543 cities H5892 that Solomon H8010 had, and all the chariot H7393 cities H5892, and the cities H5892 of the horsemen H6571, and all that Solomon H8010 desired H2836 (8804) H2837 to build H1129 (8800) in Jerusalem H3389, and in Lebanon H3844, and throughout all the land H0776 of his dominion H4475.
008:007 [As for] all the people H5971 [that were] left H3498 (8737) of the Hittites H2850, and the Amorites H0567, and the Perizzites H6522, and the Hivites H2340, and the Jebusites H2983, which [were] not of Israel H3478,
008:008 [But] of their children H1121, who were left H3498 (8738) after H0310 them in the land H0776, whom the children H1121 of Israel H3478 consumed H3615 (8765) not, them did Solomon H8010 make to pay H5927 (8686) tribute H4522 until this day H3117.
008:009 But of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did Solomon H8010 make H5414 (8804) no servants H5650 for his work H4399; but they [were] men H0582 of war H4421, and chief H8269 of his captains H7991, and captains H8269 of his chariots H7393 and horsemen H6571.
008:010 And these [were] the chief H8269 of king H4428 Solomon’s H8010 officers H5324 (8737) (8675) H5333, [even] two hundred H3967 and fifty H2572, that bare rule H7287 (8802) over the people H5971.
008:011 And Solomon H8010 brought up H5927 (8689) the daughter H1323 of Pharaoh H6547 out of the city H5892 of David H1732 unto the house H1004 that he had built H1129 (8804) for her: for he said H0559 (8804), My wife H0802 shall not dwell H3427 (8799) in the house H1004 of David H1732 king H4428 of Israel H3478, because [the places are] holy H6944, whereunto the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 hath come H0935 (8804).
008:012 Then Solomon H8010 offered H5927 (8689) burnt offerings H5930 unto the LORD H3068 on the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068, which he had built H1129 (8804) before H6440 the porch H0197,
008:013 Even after a certain rate H1697 every day H3117, offering H5927 (8687) according to the commandment H4687 of Moses H4872, on the sabbaths H7676, and on the new moons H2320, and on the solemn feasts H4150, three H7969 times H6471 in the year H8141, [even] in the feast H2282 of unleavened bread H4682, and in the feast H2282 of weeks H7620, and in the feast H2282 of tabernacles H5521.
008:014 And he appointed H5975 (8686), according to the order H4941 of David H1732 his father H0001, the courses H4256 of the priests H3548 to their service H5656, and the Levites H3881 to their charges H4931, to praise H1984 (8763) and minister H8334 (8763) before the priests H3548, as the duty H1697 of every day H3117 required H3117: the porters H7778 also by their courses H4256 at every gate H8179: for so had David H1732 the man H0376 of God H0430 commanded H4687.
008:015 And they departed H5493 (8804) not from the commandment H4687 of the king H4428 unto the priests H3548 and Levites H3881 concerning any matter H1697, or concerning the treasures H0214.
008:016 Now all the work H4399 of Solomon H8010 was prepared H3559 (8735) unto the day H3117 of the foundation H4143 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and until it was finished H3615 (8800). [So] the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 was perfected H8003.
008:017 Then went H1980 (8804) Solomon H8010 to Eziongeber H6100, and to Eloth H0359, at the sea H3220 side H8193 in the land H0776 of Edom H0123.
008:018 And Huram H2361 sent H7971 (8799) him by the hands H3027 of his servants H5650 ships H0591 (8675) H0591, and servants H5650 that had knowledge H3045 (8802) of the sea H3220; and they went H0935 (8799) with the servants H5650 of Solomon H8010 to Ophir H0211, and took H3947 (8799) thence four H0702 hundred H3967 and fifty H2572 talents H3603 of gold H2091, and brought H0935 (8686) [them] to king H4428 Solomon H8010.
009:001 ¶  And when the queen H4436 of Sheba H7614 heard H8085 (8804) of the fame H8088 of Solomon H8010, she came H0935 (8799) to prove H5254 (8763) Solomon H8010 with hard questions H2420 at Jerusalem H3389, with a very H3966 great H3515 company H2428, and camels H1581 that bare H5375 (8802) spices H1314, and gold H2091 in abundance H7230, and precious H3368 stones H0068: and when she was come H0935 (8799) to Solomon H8010, she communed H1696 (8762) with him of all that was in her heart H3824.
009:002 And Solomon H8010 told H5046 (8686) her all her questions H1697: and there was nothing hid H5956 (8738) from Solomon H8010 which he told H5046 (8689) her not.
009:003 And when the queen H4436 of Sheba H7614 had seen H7200 (8799) the wisdom H2451 of Solomon H8010, and the house H1004 that he had built H1129 (8804),
009:004 And the meat H3978 of his table H7979, and the sitting H4186 of his servants H5650, and the attendance H4612 of his ministers H8334 (8764), and their apparel H4403; his cupbearers H8248 (8688) also, and their apparel H4403; and his ascent H5944 by which he went up H5927 (8799) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068; there was no more spirit H7307 in her.
009:005 And she said H0559 (8799) to the king H4428, [It was] a true H0571 report H1697 which I heard H8085 (8804) in mine own land H0776 of thine acts H1697, and of thy wisdom H2451:
009:006 Howbeit I believed H0539 (8689) not their words H1697, until I came H0935 (8804), and mine eyes H5869 had seen H7200 (8799) [it]: and, behold, the one half H2677 of the greatness H4768 of thy wisdom H2451 was not told H5046 (8717) me: [for] thou exceedest H3254 (8804) the fame H8052 that I heard H8085 (8804).
009:007 Happy H0835 [are] thy men H0582, and happy H0835 [are] these thy servants H5650, which stand H5975 (8802) continually H8548 before H6440 thee, and hear H8085 (8802) thy wisdom H2451.
009:008 Blessed H1288 (8803) be the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which delighted H2654 (8804) in thee to set H5414 (8800) thee on his throne H3678, [to be] king H4428 for the LORD H3068 thy God H0430: because thy God H0430 loved H0160 Israel H3478, to establish H5975 (8687) them for ever H5769, therefore made H5414 (8799) he thee king H4428 over them, to do H6213 (8800) judgment H4941 and justice H6666.
009:009 And she gave H5414 (8799) the king H4428 an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242 talents H3603 of gold H2091, and of spices H1314 great H3966 abundance H7230, and precious H3368 stones H0068: neither was there any such spice H1314 as the queen H4436 of Sheba H7614 gave H5414 (8804) king H4428 Solomon H8010.
009:010 And the servants H5650 also of Huram H2361, and the servants H5650 of Solomon H8010, which brought H0935 (8689) gold H2091 from Ophir H0211, brought H0935 (8689) algum H0418 trees H6086 and precious H3368 stones H0068.
009:011 And the king H4428 made H6213 (8799) [of] the algum H0418 trees H6086 terraces H4546 to the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and to the king’s H4428 palace H1004, and harps H3658 and psalteries H5035 for singers H7891 (8802): and there were none such H1992 seen H7200 (8738) before H6440 in the land H0776 of Judah H3063.
009:012 And king H4428 Solomon H8010 gave H5414 (8804) to the queen H4436 of Sheba H7614 all her desire H2656, whatsoever she asked H7592 (8804), beside [that] which she had brought H0935 (8689) unto the king H4428. So she turned H2015 (8799), and went away H3212 (8799) to her own land H0776, she and her servants H5650.
009:013 Now the weight H4948 of gold H2091 that came H0935 (8804) to Solomon H8010 in one H0259 year H8141 was six H8337 hundred H3967 and threescore H8346 and six H8337 talents H3603 of gold H2091;
009:014 Beside [that which] chapmen H0582 H8446 (8802) and merchants H5503 (8802) brought H0935 (8688). And all the kings H4428 of Arabia H6152 and governors H6346 of the country H0776 brought H0935 (8688) gold H2091 and silver H3701 to Solomon H8010.
009:015 And king H4428 Solomon H8010 made H6213 (8799) two hundred H3967 targets H6793 [of] beaten H7820 (8803) gold H2091: six H8337 hundred H3967 [shekels] of beaten H7820 (8803) gold H2091 went H5927 (8686) to one H0259 target H6793.
009:016 And three H7969 hundred H3967 shields H4043 [made he of] beaten H7820 (8803) gold H2091: three H7969 hundred H3967 [shekels] of gold H2091 went H5927 (8686) to one H0259 shield H4043. And the king H4428 put H5414 (8799) them in the house H1004 of the forest H3293 of Lebanon H3844.
009:017 Moreover the king H4428 made H6213 (8799) a great H1419 throne H3678 of ivory H8127, and overlaid H6823 (8762) it with pure H2889 gold H2091.
009:018 And [there were] six H8337 steps H4609 to the throne H3678, with a footstool H3534 of gold H2091, [which were] fastened H0270 (8716) to the throne H3678, and stays H3027 on each side of the sitting H3427 (8800) place H4725, and two H8147 lions H0738 standing H5975 (8802) by H0681 the stays H3027:
009:019 And twelve H8147 H6240 lions H0738 stood H5975 (8802) there on the one side and on the other upon the six H8337 steps H4609. There was not the like made H6213 (8738) in any kingdom H4467.
009:020 And all the drinking H4945 vessels H3627 of king H4428 Solomon H8010 [were of] gold H2091, and all the vessels H3627 of the house H1004 of the forest H3293 of Lebanon H3844 [were of] pure H5462 (8803) gold H2091: none [were of] silver H3701; it was [not] any H3972 thing accounted H2803 (8737) of in the days H3117 of Solomon H8010.
009:021 For the king’s H4428 ships H0591 went H1980 (8802) to Tarshish H8659 with the servants H5650 of Huram H2361: every three H7969 years H8141 once H0259 came H0935 (8799) the ships H0591 of Tarshish H8659 bringing H5375 (8802) gold H2091, and silver H3701, ivory H8143, and apes H6971, and peacocks H8500.
009:022 And king H4428 Solomon H8010 passed H1431 (8799) all the kings H4428 of the earth H0776 in riches H6239 and wisdom H2451.
009:023 And all the kings H4428 of the earth H0776 sought H1245 (8764) the presence H6440 of Solomon H8010, to hear H8085 (8800) his wisdom H2451, that God H0430 had put H5414 (8804) in his heart H3820.
009:024 And they brought H0935 (8688) every man H0376 his present H4503, vessels H3627 of silver H3701, and vessels H3627 of gold H2091, and raiment H8008, harness H5402, and spices H1314, horses H5483, and mules H6505, a rate H1697 year H8141 by year H8141.
009:025 And Solomon H8010 had four H0702 thousand H0505 stalls H0723 for horses H5483 and chariots H4818, and twelve H8147 H6240 thousand H0505 horsemen H6571; whom he bestowed H3240 (8686) in the chariot H7393 cities H5892, and with the king H4428 at Jerusalem H3389.
009:026 And he reigned H4910 (8802) over all the kings H4428 from the river H5104 even unto the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430, and to the border H1366 of Egypt H4714.
009:027 And the king H4428 made H5414 (8799) silver H3701 in Jerusalem H3389 as stones H0068, and cedar trees H0730 made H5414 (8804) he as the sycomore trees H8256 that [are] in the low plains H8219 in abundance H7230.
009:028 And they brought H3318 (8688) unto Solomon H8010 horses H5483 out of Egypt H4714, and out of all lands H0776.
009:029 Now the rest H7605 of the acts H1697 of Solomon H8010, first H7223 and last H0314, [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H1697 of Nathan H5416 the prophet H5030, and in the prophecy H5016 of Ahijah H0281 the Shilonite H7888, and in the visions H2378 of Iddo H3260 the seer H2374 against Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028?
009:030 And Solomon H8010 reigned H4427 (8799) in Jerusalem H3389 over all Israel H3478 forty H0705 years H8141.
009:031 And Solomon H8010 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and he was buried H6912 (8799) in the city H5892 of David H1732 his father H0001: and Rehoboam H7346 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
010:001 ¶  And Rehoboam H7346 went H3212 (8799) to Shechem H7927: for to Shechem H7927 were all Israel H3478 come H0935 (8804) to make him king H4427 (8687).
010:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, who [was] in Egypt H4714, whither he had fled H1272 (8804) from the presence H6440 of Solomon H8010 the king H4428, heard H8085 (8800) [it], that Jeroboam H3379 returned H7725 (8799) out of Egypt H4714.
010:003 And they sent H7971 (8799) and called H7121 (8799) him. So Jeroboam H3379 and all Israel H3478 came H0935 (8799) and spake H1696 (8762) to Rehoboam H7346, saying H0559 (8800),
010:004 Thy father H0001 made our yoke H5923 grievous H7185 (8689): now therefore ease H7043 (8685) thou somewhat the grievous H7186 servitude H5656 of thy father H0001, and his heavy H3515 yoke H5923 that he put H5414 (8804) upon us, and we will serve H5647 (8799) thee.
010:005 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Come again H7725 (8798) unto me after three H7969 days H3117. And the people H5971 departed H3212 (8799).
010:006 And king H4428 Rehoboam H7346 took counsel H3289 (8735) with the old H2205 men that had stood H5975 (8802) before H6440 Solomon H8010 his father H0001 while he yet lived H2416, saying H0559 (8800), What H0349 counsel give H3289 (8737) ye [me] to return H7725 (8687) answer H1697 to this people H5971?
010:007 And they spake H1696 (8762) unto him, saying H0559 (8800), If thou be kind H2896 to this people H5971, and please H7521 (8804) them, and speak H1696 (8765) good H2896 words H1697 to them, they will be thy servants H5650 for ever H3117.
010:008 But he forsook H5800 (8799) the counsel H6098 which the old men H2205 gave H3289 (8804) him, and took counsel H3289 (8735) with the young men H3206 that were brought up H1431 (8804) with him, that stood H5975 (8802) before H6440 him.
010:009 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, What advice H3289 (8737) give ye that we may return H7725 (8686) answer H1697 to this people H5971, which have spoken H1696 (8765) to me, saying H0559 (8800), Ease H7043 (8685) somewhat the yoke H5923 that thy father H0001 did put H5414 (8804) upon us?
010:010 And the young men H3206 that were brought up H1431 (8804) with him spake H1696 (8762) unto him, saying H0559 (8800), Thus shalt thou answer H0559 (8799) the people H5971 that spake H1696 (8765) unto thee, saying H0559 (8800), Thy father H0001 made H3513 our yoke H5923 heavy H3513 (8689), but make thou [it] somewhat lighter H7043 (8685) for us; thus shalt thou say H0559 (8799) unto them, My little H6995 [finger] shall be thicker H5666 (8804) than my father’s H0001 loins H4975.
010:011 For whereas H6258 my father H0001 put H6006 (8689) a heavy H3515 yoke H5923 upon you, I will put more H3254 (8686) to your yoke H5923: my father H0001 chastised H3256 (8765) you with whips H7752, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions H6137.
010:012 So Jeroboam H3379 and all the people H5971 came H0935 (8799) to Rehoboam H7346 on the third H7992 day H3117, as the king H4428 bade H1696 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), Come again H7725 (8798) to me on the third H7992 day H3117.
010:013 And the king H4428 answered H6030 (8799) them roughly H7186; and king H4428 Rehoboam H7346 forsook H5800 (8799) the counsel H6098 of the old men H2205,
010:014 And answered H1696 (8762) them after the advice H6098 of the young men H3206, saying H0559 (8800), My father H0001 made your yoke H5923 heavy H3513 (8689), but I will add H3254 (8686) thereto: my father H0001 chastised H3256 (8765) you with whips H7752, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions H6137.
010:015 So the king H4428 hearkened H8085 (8804) not unto the people H5971: for the cause H5252 was of God H0430, that the LORD H3068 might perform H6965 (8687) his word H1697, which he spake H1696 (8765) by the hand H3027 of Ahijah H0281 the Shilonite H7888 to Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028.
010:016 And when all Israel H3478 [saw H7200 (8804) ] that the king H4428 would not hearken H8085 (8804) unto them, the people H5971 answered H7725 (8686) the king H4428, saying H0559 (8800), What portion H2506 have we in David H1732? and [we have] none inheritance H5159 in the son H1121 of Jesse H3448: every man H0376 to your tents H0168, O Israel H3478: [and] now, David H1732, see H7200 (8798) to thine own house H1004. So all Israel H3478 went H3212 (8799) to their tents H0168.
010:017 But [as for] the children H1121 of Israel H3478 that dwelt H3427 (8802) in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, Rehoboam H7346 reigned H4427 (8799) over them.
010:018 Then king H4428 Rehoboam H7346 sent H7971 (8799) Hadoram H1913 that [was] over the tribute H4522; and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 stoned H7275 (8799) him with stones H0068, that he died H4191 (8799). But king H4428 Rehoboam H7346 made speed H0553 (8694) to get him up H5927 (8800) to [his] chariot H4818, to flee H5127 (8800) to Jerusalem H3389.
010:019 And Israel H3478 rebelled H6586 (8799) against the house H1004 of David H1732 unto this day H3117.
011:001 ¶  And when Rehoboam H7346 was come H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389, he gathered H6950 (8686) of the house H1004 of Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144 an hundred H3967 and fourscore H8084 thousand H0505 chosen H0977 (8803) [men], which were warriors H6213 (8802) H4421, to fight H3898 (8736) against Israel H3478, that he might bring H7725 the kingdom H4467 again H7725 (8687) to Rehoboam H7346.
011:002 But the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to Shemaiah H8098 the man H0376 of God H0430, saying H0559 (8800),
011:003 Speak H0559 (8798) unto Rehoboam H7346 the son H1121 of Solomon H8010, king H4428 of Judah H3063, and to all Israel H3478 in Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144, saying H0559 (8800),
011:004 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Ye shall not go up H5927 (8799), nor fight H3898 (8735) against your brethren H0251: return H7725 (8798) every man H0376 to his house H1004: for this thing H1697 is done H1961 (8738) of me. And they obeyed H8085 (8799) the words H1697 of the LORD H3068, and returned H7725 (8799) from going H3212 (8800) against Jeroboam H3379.
011:005 And Rehoboam H7346 dwelt H3427 (8799) in Jerusalem H3389, and built H1129 (8799) cities H5892 for defence H4692 in Judah H3063.
011:006 He built H1129 (8799) even Bethlehem H1035, and Etam H5862, and Tekoa H8620,
011:007 And Bethzur H1049, and Shoco H7755, and Adullam H5725,
011:008 And Gath H1661, and Mareshah H4762, and Ziph H2128,
011:009 And Adoraim H0115, and Lachish H3923, and Azekah H5825,
011:010 And Zorah H6881, and Aijalon H0357, and Hebron H2275, which [are] in Judah H3063 and in Benjamin H1144 fenced H4694 cities H5892.
011:011 And he fortified H2388 (8762) the strong holds H4694, and put H5414 (8799) captains H5057 in them, and store H0214 of victual H3978, and of oil H8081 and wine H3196.
011:012 And in every several city H5892 [he put] shields H6793 and spears H7420, and made them exceeding H7235 (8687) H3966 strong H2388 (8762), having Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144 on his side.
011:013 And the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881 that [were] in all Israel H3478 resorted H3320 (8694) to him out of all their coasts H1366.
011:014 For the Levites H3881 left H5800 (8804) their suburbs H4054 and their possession H0272, and came H3212 (8799) to Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389: for Jeroboam H3379 and his sons H1121 had cast them off H2186 (8689) from executing the priest’s office H3547 (8763) unto the LORD H3068:
011:015 And he ordained H5975 (8686) him priests H3548 for the high places H1116, and for the devils H8163, and for the calves H5695 which he had made H6213 (8804).
011:016 And after H0310 them out of all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 such as set H5414 (8802) their hearts H3824 to seek H1245 (8763) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 came H0935 (8804) to Jerusalem H3389, to sacrifice H2076 (8800) unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001.
011:017 So they strengthened H2388 (8762) the kingdom H4438 of Judah H3063, and made Rehoboam H7346 the son H1121 of Solomon H8010 strong H0553 (8762), three H7969 years H8141: for three H7969 years H8141 they walked H1980 (8804) in the way H1870 of David H1732 and Solomon H8010.
011:018 And Rehoboam H7346 took H3947 (8799) him Mahalath H4258 the daughter H1323 (8675) H1121 of Jerimoth H3406 the son H1121 of David H1732 to wife H0802, [and] Abihail H0032 the daughter H1323 of Eliab H0446 the son H1121 of Jesse H3448;
011:019 Which bare H3205 (8799) him children H1121; Jeush H3266, and Shamariah H8114, and Zaham H2093.
011:020 And after H0310 her he took H3947 (8804) Maachah H4601 the daughter H1323 of Absalom H0053; which bare H3205 (8799) him Abijah H0029, and Attai H6262, and Ziza H2124, and Shelomith H8019.
011:021 And Rehoboam H7346 loved H0157 (8799) Maachah H4601 the daughter H1323 of Absalom H0053 above all his wives H0802 and his concubines H6370: (for he took H5375 (8804) eighteen H8083 H6240 wives H0802, and threescore H8346 concubines H6370; and begat H3205 (8686) twenty H6242 and eight H8083 sons H1121, and threescore H8346 daughters H1323.)
011:022 And Rehoboam H7346 made H5975 (8686) Abijah H0029 the son H1121 of Maachah H4601 the chief H7218, [to be] ruler H5057 among his brethren H0251: for [he thought] to make him king H4427 (8687).
011:023 And he dealt wisely H0995 (8799), and dispersed H6555 (8799) of all his children H1121 throughout all the countries H0776 of Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144, unto every fenced H4694 city H5892: and he gave H5414 (8799) them victual H4202 in abundance H7230. And he desired H7592 (8799) many H1995 wives H0802.
012:001 ¶  And it came to pass, when Rehoboam H7346 had established H3559 (8687) the kingdom H4438, and had strengthened H2393 himself, he forsook H5800 (8804) the law H8451 of the LORD H3068, and all Israel H3478 with him.
012:002 And it came to pass, [that] in the fifth H2549 year H8141 of king H4428 Rehoboam H7346 Shishak H7895 king H4428 of Egypt H4714 came up H5927 (8804) against Jerusalem H3389, because they had transgressed H4603 (8804) against the LORD H3068,
012:003 With twelve hundred H3967 H0505 chariots H7393, and threescore H8346 thousand H0505 horsemen H6571: and the people H5971 [were] without number H4557 that came H0935 (8804) with him out of Egypt H4714; the Lubims H3864, the Sukkiims H5525, and the Ethiopians H3569.
012:004 And he took H3920 (8799) the fenced H4694 cities H5892 which [pertained] to Judah H3063, and came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
012:005 Then came H0935 (8804) Shemaiah H8098 the prophet H5030 to Rehoboam H7346, and [to] the princes H8269 of Judah H3063, that were gathered together H0622 (8738) to Jerusalem H3389 because H6440 of Shishak H7895, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Ye have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and therefore have I also H0637 left H5800 (8804) you in the hand H3027 of Shishak H7895.
012:006 Whereupon the princes H8269 of Israel H3478 and the king H4428 humbled H3665 (8735) themselves; and they said H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 [is] righteous H6662.
012:007 And when the LORD H3068 saw H7200 (8800) that they humbled H3665 (8738) themselves, the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to Shemaiah H8098, saying H0559 (8800), They have humbled H3665 (8738) themselves; [therefore] I will not destroy H7843 (8686) them, but I will grant H5414 (8804) them some H4592 deliverance H6413; and my wrath H2534 shall not be poured out H5413 (8799) upon Jerusalem H3389 by the hand H3027 of Shishak H7895.
012:008 Nevertheless they shall be his servants H5650; that they may know H3045 (8799) my service H5656, and the service H5656 of the kingdoms H4467 of the countries H0776.
012:009 So Shishak H7895 king H4428 of Egypt H4714 came up H5927 (8799) against Jerusalem H3389, and took away H3947 (8799) the treasures H0214 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and the treasures H0214 of the king’s H4428 house H1004; he took H3947 (8804) all: he carried away H3947 (8799) also the shields H4043 of gold H2091 which Solomon H8010 had made H6213 (8804).
012:010 Instead of which king H4428 Rehoboam H7346 made H6213 (8799) shields H4043 of brass H5178, and committed H6485 (8689) [them] to the hands H3027 of the chief H8269 of the guard H7323 (8801), that kept H8104 (8802) the entrance H6607 of the king’s H4428 house H1004.
012:011 And when H1767 the king H4428 entered H0935 (8800) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, the guard H7323 (8801) came H0935 (8804) and fetched H5375 (8804) them, and brought them again H7725 (8689) into the guard H7323 (8801) chamber H8372.
012:012 And when he humbled H3665 (8736) himself, the wrath H0639 of the LORD H3068 turned H7725 (8804) from him, that he would not destroy H7843 (8687) [him] altogether H3617: and also in Judah H3063 things H1697 went well H2896.
012:013 So king H4428 Rehoboam H7346 strengthened H2388 (8691) himself in Jerusalem H3389, and reigned H4427 (8799): for Rehoboam H7346 [was] one H0259 and forty H0705 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) seventeen H7651 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389, the city H5892 which the LORD H3068 had chosen H0977 (8804) out of all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, to put H7760 (8800) his name H8034 there. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Naamah H5279 an Ammonitess H5985.
012:014 And he did H6213 (8799) evil H7451, because he prepared H3559 (8689) not his heart H3820 to seek H1875 (8800) the LORD H3068.
012:015 Now the acts H1697 of Rehoboam H7346, first H7223 and last H0314, [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H1697 of Shemaiah H8098 the prophet H5030, and of Iddo H5714 the seer H2374 concerning genealogies H3187 (8692)? And [there were] wars H4421 between Rehoboam H7346 and Jeroboam H3379 continually H3117.
012:016 And Rehoboam H7346 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and was buried H6912 (8735) in the city H5892 of David H1732: and Abijah H0029 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
013:001 ¶  Now in the eighteenth H8083 H6240 year H8141 of king H4428 Jeroboam H3379 began Abijah H0029 to reign H4427 (8799) over Judah H3063.
013:002 He reigned H4427 (8804) three H7969 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. His mother’s H0517 name H8034 also [was] Michaiah H4322 the daughter H1323 of Uriel H0222 of Gibeah H1390. And there was war H4421 between Abijah H0029 and Jeroboam H3379.
013:003 And Abijah H0029 set H0631 the battle H4421 in array H0631 (8799) with an army H2428 of valiant men H1368 of war H4421, [even] four H0702 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 chosen H0977 (8803) men H0376: Jeroboam H3379 also set the battle H4421 in array H6186 (8804) against him with eight H8083 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 chosen H0977 (8803) men H0376, [being] mighty men H1368 of valour H2428.
013:004 And Abijah H0029 stood up H6965 (8799) upon mount H2022 Zemaraim H6787, which [is] in mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, and said H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798) me, thou Jeroboam H3379, and all Israel H3478;
013:005 Ought ye not to know H3045 (8800) that the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 gave H5414 (8804) the kingdom H4467 over Israel H3478 to David H1732 for ever H5769, [even] to him and to his sons H1121 by a covenant H1285 of salt H4417?
013:006 Yet Jeroboam H3379 the son H1121 of Nebat H5028, the servant H5650 of Solomon H8010 the son H1121 of David H1732, is risen up H6965 (8799), and hath rebelled H4775 (8799) against his lord H0113.
013:007 And there are gathered H6908 (8735) unto him vain H7386 men H0582, the children H1121 of Belial H1100, and have strengthened H0553 (8691) themselves against Rehoboam H7346 the son H1121 of Solomon H8010, when Rehoboam H7346 was young H5288 and tenderhearted H7390 H3824, and could not withstand H2388 (8694) them H6440.
013:008 And now ye think H0559 (8802) to withstand H2388 (8692) the kingdom H6440 H4467 of the LORD H3068 in the hand H3027 of the sons H1121 of David H1732; and ye [be] a great H7227 multitude H1995, and [there are] with you golden H2091 calves H5695, which Jeroboam H3379 made H6213 (8804) you for gods H0430.
013:009 Have ye not cast out H5080 (8689) the priests H3548 of the LORD H3068, the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175, and the Levites H3881, and have made H6213 (8799) you priests H3548 after the manner of the nations H5971 of [other] lands H0776? so that whosoever cometh H0935 (8802) to consecrate H4390 (8763) H3027 himself with a young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499 and seven H7651 rams H0352, [the same] may be a priest H3548 of [them that are] no H3808 gods H0430.
013:010 But as for us, the LORD H3068 [is] our God H0430, and we have not forsaken H5800 (8804) him; and the priests H3548, which minister H8334 (8764) unto the LORD H3068, [are] the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175, and the Levites H3881 [wait] upon [their] business H4399:
013:011 And they burn H6999 (8688) unto the LORD H3068 every morning H1242 and every evening H6153 burnt sacrifices H5930 and sweet H5561 incense H7004: the shewbread H3899 H4635 also [set they in order] upon the pure H2889 table H7979; and the candlestick H4501 of gold H2091 with the lamps H5216 thereof, to burn H1197 (8763) every evening H6153: for we keep H8104 (8802) the charge H4931 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430; but ye have forsaken H5800 (8804) him.
013:012 And, behold, God H0430 himself [is] with us for [our] captain H7218, and his priests H3548 with sounding H8643 trumpets H2689 to cry alarm H7321 (8687) against you. O children H1121 of Israel H3478, fight H3898 (8735) ye not against the LORD H3068 God H0430 of your fathers H0001; for ye shall not prosper H6743 (8686).
013:013 But Jeroboam H3379 caused an ambushment H3993 to come H0935 (8800) about H5437 (8689) behind H0310 them: so they were before H6440 Judah H3063, and the ambushment H3993 [was] behind H0310 them.
013:014 And when Judah H3063 looked back H6437 (8799), behold, the battle H4421 [was] before H6440 and behind H0268: and they cried H6817 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, and the priests H3548 sounded H2690 (8688) (8675) H2690 (8764) with the trumpets H2689.
013:015 Then the men H0376 of Judah H3063 gave a shout H7321 (8686): and as the men H0376 of Judah H3063 shouted H7321 (8687), it came to pass, that God H0430 smote H5062 (8804) Jeroboam H3379 and all Israel H3478 before H6440 Abijah H0029 and Judah H3063.
013:016 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 fled H5127 (8799) before H6440 Judah H3063: and God H0430 delivered H5414 (8799) them into their hand H3027.
013:017 And Abijah H0029 and his people H5971 slew H5221 (8686) them with a great H7227 slaughter H4347: so there fell down H5307 (8799) slain H2491 of Israel H3478 five H2568 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 chosen H0977 (8803) men H0376.
013:018 Thus the children H1121 of Israel H3478 were brought H3665 (8735) under at that time H6256, and the children H1121 of Judah H3063 prevailed H0553 (8799), because they relied H8172 (8738) upon the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001.
013:019 And Abijah H0029 pursued H7291 (8799) after H0310 Jeroboam H3379, and took H3920 (8799) cities H5892 from him, Bethel H1008 with the towns H1323 thereof, and Jeshanah H3466 with the towns H1323 thereof, and Ephrain H6085 with the towns H1323 thereof.
013:020 Neither did Jeroboam H3379 recover H6113 (8804) strength H3581 again in the days H3117 of Abijah H0029: and the LORD H3068 struck H5062 (8799) him, and he died H4191 (8799).
013:021 But Abijah H0029 waxed mighty H2388 (8691), and married H5375 (8799) fourteen H0702 H6240 wives H0802, and begat H3205 (8686) twenty H6242 and two H8147 sons H1121, and sixteen H8337 H6240 daughters H1323.
013:022 And the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Abijah H0029, and his ways H1870, and his sayings H1697, [are] written H3789 (8803) in the story H4097 of the prophet H5030 Iddo H5714.
014:001 ¶  So Abijah H0029 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and they buried H6912 (8799) him in the city H5892 of David H1732: and Asa H0609 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead. In his days H3117 the land H0776 was quiet H8252 (8804) ten H6235 years H8141.
014:002 And Asa H0609 did H6213 (8799) [that which was] good H2896 and right H3477 in the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068 his God H0430:
014:003 For he took away H5493 (8686) the altars H4196 of the strange H5236 [gods], and the high places H1116, and brake down H7665 (8762) the images H4676, and cut down H1438 (8762) the groves H0842:
014:004 And commanded H0559 (8799) Judah H3063 to seek H1875 (8800) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001, and to do H6213 (8800) the law H8451 and the commandment H4687.
014:005 Also he took away H5493 (8686) out of all the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 the high places H1116 and the images H2553: and the kingdom H4467 was quiet H8252 (8799) before H6440 him.
014:006 And he built H1129 (8799) fenced H4694 cities H5892 in Judah H3063: for the land H0776 had rest H8252 (8804), and he had no war H4421 in those years H8141; because the LORD H3068 had given him rest H5117 (8689).
014:007 Therefore he said H0559 (8799) unto Judah H3063, Let us build H1129 (8799) these cities H5892, and make about H5437 (8686) [them] walls H2346, and towers H4026, gates H1817, and bars H1280, [while] the land H0776 [is] yet before H6440 us; because we have sought H1875 (8804) the LORD H3068 our God H0430, we have sought H1875 (8804) [him], and he hath given us rest H5117 (8799) on every side H5439. So they built H1129 (8799) and prospered H6743 (8686).
014:008 And Asa H0609 had an army H2428 [of men] that bare H5375 (8802) targets H6793 and spears H7420, out of Judah H3063 three H7969 hundred H3967 thousand H0505; and out of Benjamin H1144, that bare H5375 (8802) shields H4043 and drew H1869 (8802) bows H7198, two hundred H3967 and fourscore H8084 thousand H0505: all these [were] mighty men H1368 of valour H2428.
014:009 And there came out H3318 (8799) against them Zerah H2226 the Ethiopian H3569 with an host H2428 of a thousand H0505 thousand H0505, and three H7969 hundred H3967 chariots H4818; and came H0935 (8799) unto Mareshah H4762.
014:010 Then Asa H0609 went out H3318 (8799) against H6440 him, and they set the battle H4421 in array H6186 (8799) in the valley H1516 of Zephathah H6859 at Mareshah H4762.
014:011 And Asa H0609 cried H7121 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 his God H0430, and said H0559 (8799), LORD H3068, [it is] nothing with thee to help H5826 (8800), whether H0996 with many H7227, or with them that have no power H3581: help H5826 (8798) us, O LORD H3068 our God H0430; for we rest H8172 (8738) on thee, and in thy name H8034 we go H0935 (8804) against this multitude H1995. O LORD H3068, thou [art] our God H0430; let not man H0582 prevail H6113 (8799) against thee.
014:012 So the LORD H3068 smote H5062 (8799) the Ethiopians H3569 before H6440 Asa H0609, and before H6440 Judah H3063; and the Ethiopians H3569 fled H5127 (8799).
014:013 And Asa H0609 and the people H5971 that [were] with him pursued H7291 (8799) them unto Gerar H1642: and the Ethiopians H3569 were overthrown H5307 (8799), that they could not recover H4241 themselves; for they were destroyed H7665 (8738) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and before H6440 his host H4264; and they carried away H5375 (8799) very H3966 much H7235 (8687) spoil H7998.
014:014 And they smote H5221 (8686) all the cities H5892 round about H5439 Gerar H1642; for the fear H6343 of the LORD H3068 came upon them: and they spoiled H0962 (8799) all the cities H5892; for there was exceeding much H7227 spoil H0961 in them.
014:015 They smote H5221 (8689) also the tents H0168 of cattle H4735, and carried away H7617 (8799) sheep H6629 and camels H1581 in abundance H7230, and returned H7725 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
015:001 ¶  And the Spirit H7307 of God H0430 came upon Azariah H5838 the son H1121 of Oded H5752:
015:002 And he went out H3318 (8799) to meet H6440 Asa H0609, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Hear H8085 (8798) ye me, Asa H0609, and all Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144; The LORD H3068 [is] with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek H1875 (8799) him, he will be found H4672 (8735) of you; but if ye forsake H5800 (8799) him, he will forsake H5800 (8799) you.
015:003 Now for a long H7227 season H3117 Israel H3478 [hath been] without H3808 the true H0571 God H0430, and without a teaching H3384 (8688) priest H3548, and without law H8451.
015:004 But when they in their trouble H6862 did turn H7725 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, and sought H1245 (8762) him, he was found H4672 (8735) of them.
015:005 And in those times H6256 [there was] no peace H7965 to him that went out H3318 (8802), nor to him that came in H0935 (8802), but great H7227 vexations H4103 [were] upon all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the countries H0776.
015:006 And nation H1471 was destroyed H3807 (8795) of nation H1471, and city H5892 of city H5892: for God H0430 did vex H2000 (8804) them with all adversity H6869.
015:007 Be ye strong H2388 (8798) therefore, and let not your hands H3027 be weak H7503 (8799): for your work H6468 shall be H3426 rewarded H7939.
015:008 And when Asa H0609 heard H8085 (8800) these words H1697, and the prophecy H5016 of Oded H5752 the prophet H5030, he took courage H2388 (8694), and put away H5674 (8686) the abominable idols H8251 out of all the land H0776 of Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144, and out of the cities H5892 which he had taken H3920 (8804) from mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, and renewed H2318 (8762) the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068, that [was] before H6440 the porch H0197 of the LORD H3068.
015:009 And he gathered H6908 (8799) all Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144, and the strangers H1481 (8802) with them out of Ephraim H0669 and Manasseh H4519, and out of Simeon H8095: for they fell H5307 (8804) to him out of Israel H3478 in abundance H7230, when they saw H7200 (8800) that the LORD H3068 his God H0430 [was] with him.
015:010 So they gathered themselves together H6908 (8735) at Jerusalem H3389 in the third H7992 month H2320, in the fifteenth H2568 H6240 year H8141 of the reign H4438 of Asa H0609.
015:011 And they offered H2076 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 the same time H3117, of the spoil H7998 [which] they had brought H0935 (8689), seven H7651 hundred H3967 oxen H1241 and seven H7651 thousand H0505 sheep H6629.
015:012 And they entered H0935 (8799) into a covenant H1285 to seek H1875 (8800) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001 with all their heart H3824 and with all their soul H5315;
015:013 That whosoever would not seek H1875 (8799) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 should be put to death H4191 (8714), whether H4480 small H6996 or great H1419, whether man H0376 or woman H0802.
015:014 And they sware H7650 (8735) unto the LORD H3068 with a loud H1419 voice H6963, and with shouting H8643, and with trumpets H2689, and with cornets H7782.
015:015 And all Judah H3063 rejoiced H8055 (8799) at the oath H7621: for they had sworn H7650 (8738) with all their heart H3824, and sought H1245 (8765) him with their whole desire H7522; and he was found H4672 (8735) of them: and the LORD H3068 gave them rest H5117 (8799) round about H5439.
015:016 And also [concerning] Maachah H4601 the mother H0517 of Asa H0609 the king H4428, he removed H5493 (8689) her from [being] queen H1377, because she had made H6213 (8804) an idol H4656 in a grove H0842: and Asa H0609 cut down H3772 (8799) her idol H4656, and stamped H1854 (8686) [it], and burnt H8313 (8799) [it] at the brook H5158 Kidron H6939.
015:017 But the high places H1116 were not taken away H5493 (8804) out of Israel H3478: nevertheless the heart H3824 of Asa H0609 was perfect H8003 all his days H3117.
015:018 And he brought H0935 (8686) into the house H1004 of God H0430 the things that his father H0001 had dedicated H6944, and that he himself had dedicated H6944, silver H3701, and gold H2091, and vessels H3627.
015:019 And there was no [more] war H4421 unto the five H2568 and thirtieth H7970 year H8141 of the reign H4438 of Asa H0609.
016:001 ¶  In the six H8337 and thirtieth H7970 year H8141 of the reign H4438 of Asa H0609 Baasha H1201 king H4428 of Israel H3478 came up H5927 (8804) against Judah H3063, and built H1129 (8799) Ramah H7414, to the intent that H1115 he might let H5414 (8800) none go out H3318 (8802) or come in H0935 (8802) to Asa H0609 king H4428 of Judah H3063.
016:002 Then Asa H0609 brought out H3318 (8686) silver H3701 and gold H2091 out of the treasures H0214 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 and of the king’s H4428 house H1004, and sent H7971 (8799) to Benhadad H1130 king H4428 of Syria H0758, that dwelt H3427 (8802) at Damascus H1834, saying H0559 (8800),
016:003 [There is] a league H1285 between me and thee, as [there was] between my father H0001 and thy father H0001: behold, I have sent H7971 (8804) thee silver H3701 and gold H2091; go H3212 (8798), break H6565 (8685) thy league H1285 with Baasha H1201 king H4428 of Israel H3478, that he may depart H5927 (8799) from me.
016:004 And Benhadad H1130 hearkened H8085 (8799) unto king H4428 Asa H0609, and sent H7971 (8799) the captains H8269 of his armies H2428 against the cities H5892 of Israel H3478; and they smote H5221 (8686) Ijon H5859, and Dan H1835, and Abelmaim H0066, and all the store H4543 cities H5892 of Naphtali H5321.
016:005 And it came to pass, when Baasha H1201 heard H8085 (8800) [it], that he left off H2308 (8799) building H1129 (8800) of Ramah H7414, and let his work H4399 cease H7673 (8686).
016:006 Then Asa H0609 the king H4428 took H3947 (8804) all Judah H3063; and they carried away H5375 (8799) the stones H0068 of Ramah H7414, and the timber H6086 thereof, wherewith Baasha H1201 was building H1129 (8804); and he built H1129 (8799) therewith Geba H1387 and Mizpah H4709.
016:007 And at that time H6256 Hanani H2607 the seer H7200 (8802) came H0935 (8804) to Asa H0609 king H4428 of Judah H3063, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Because thou hast relied H8172 (8736) on the king H4428 of Syria H0758, and not relied H8172 (8738) on the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, therefore is the host H2428 of the king H4428 of Syria H0758 escaped H4422 (8738) out of thine hand H3027.
016:008 Were not the Ethiopians H3569 and the Lubims H3864 a huge H7230 host H2428, with very H3966 many H7235 (8687) chariots H7393 and horsemen H6571? yet, because thou didst rely H8172 (8736) on the LORD H3068, he delivered H5414 (8804) them into thine hand H3027.
016:009 For the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068 run to and fro H7751 (8789) throughout the whole earth H0776, to shew himself strong H2388 (8692) in the behalf of [them] whose heart H3824 [is] perfect H8003 toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly H5528 (8738): therefore from henceforth H6258 thou shalt have H3426 wars H4421.
016:010 Then Asa H0609 was wroth H3707 (8799) with the seer H7200 (8802), and put H5414 (8799) him in a prison H4115 house H1004; for [he was] in a rage H2197 with him because of this [thing]. And Asa H0609 oppressed H7533 (8762) [some] of the people H5971 the same time H6256.
016:011 And, behold, the acts H1697 of Asa H0609, first H7223 and last H0314, lo, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 and Israel H3478.
016:012 And Asa H0609 in the thirty H7970 and ninth H8672 year H8141 of his reign H4438 was diseased H2456 (8799) in his feet H7272, until his disease H2483 [was] exceeding H4605 [great]: yet in his disease H2483 he sought H1875 (8804) not to the LORD H3068, but to the physicians H7495 (8802).
016:013 And Asa H0609 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and died H4191 (8799) in the one H0259 and fortieth H0705 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800).
016:014 And they buried H6912 (8799) him in his own sepulchres H6913, which he had made H3738 (8804) for himself in the city H5892 of David H1732, and laid H7901 (8686) him in the bed H4904 which was filled H4390 (8765) with sweet odours H1314 and divers kinds H2177 [of spices] prepared H7543 (8794) by the apothecaries H4842 ’ art H4639: and they made H8313 (8799) a very H3966 great H1419 burning H8316 for him.
017:001 ¶  And Jehoshaphat H3092 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead, and strengthened H2388 (8691) himself against Israel H3478.
017:002 And he placed H5414 (8799) forces H2428 in all the fenced H1219 (8803) cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and set H5414 (8799) garrisons H5333 in the land H0776 of Judah H3063, and in the cities H5892 of Ephraim H0669, which Asa H0609 his father H0001 had taken H3920 (8804).
017:003 And the LORD H3068 was with Jehoshaphat H3092, because he walked H1980 (8804) in the first H7223 ways H1870 of his father H0001 David H1732, and sought H1875 (8804) not unto Baalim H1168;
017:004 But sought H1875 (8804) to the [LORD] God H0430 of his father H0001, and walked H1980 (8804) in his commandments H4687, and not after the doings H4639 of Israel H3478.
017:005 Therefore the LORD H3068 stablished H3559 (8686) the kingdom H4467 in his hand H3027; and all Judah H3063 brought H5414 (8799) to Jehoshaphat H3092 presents H4503; and he had riches H6239 and honour H3519 in abundance H7230.
017:006 And his heart H3820 was lifted up H1361 (8799) in the ways H1870 of the LORD H3068: moreover he took away H5493 (8689) the high places H1116 and groves H0842 out of Judah H3063.
017:007 Also in the third H7969 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800) he sent H7971 (8804) to his princes H8269, [even] to Benhail H1134, and to Obadiah H5662, and to Zechariah H2148, and to Nethaneel H5417, and to Michaiah H4322, to teach H3925 (8763) in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063.
017:008 And with them [he sent] Levites H3881, [even] Shemaiah H8098, and Nethaniah H5418, and Zebadiah H2069, and Asahel H6214, and Shemiramoth H8070, and Jehonathan H3083, and Adonijah H0138, and Tobijah H2900, and Tobadonijah H2899, Levites H3881; and with them Elishama H0476 and Jehoram H3088, priests H3548.
017:009 And they taught H3925 (8762) in Judah H3063, and [had] the book H5612 of the law H8451 of the LORD H3068 with them, and went about H5437 (8799) throughout all the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and taught H3925 (8762) the people H5971.
017:010 And the fear H6343 of the LORD H3068 fell upon all the kingdoms H4467 of the lands H0776 that [were] round about H5439 Judah H3063, so that they made no war H3898 (8738) against Jehoshaphat H3092.
017:011 Also [some] of the Philistines H6430 brought H0935 (8688) Jehoshaphat H3092 presents H4503, and tribute H4853 silver H3701; and the Arabians H6163 brought H0935 (8688) him flocks H6629, seven H7651 thousand H0505 and seven H7651 hundred H3967 rams H0352, and seven H7651 thousand H0505 and seven H7651 hundred H3967 he goats H8495.
017:012 And Jehoshaphat H3092 waxed H1980 (8802) great H1432 exceedingly H4605; and he built H1129 (8799) in Judah H3063 castles H1003, and cities H5892 of store H4543.
017:013 And he had much H7227 business H4399 in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063: and the men H0582 of war H4421, mighty men H1368 of valour H2428, [were] in Jerusalem H3389.
017:014 And these [are] the numbers H6486 of them according to the house H1004 of their fathers H0001: Of Judah H3063, the captains H8269 of thousands H0505; Adnah H5734 the chief H8269, and with him mighty men H1368 of valour H2428 three H7969 hundred H3967 thousand H0505.
017:015 And next H3027 to him [was] Jehohanan H3076 the captain H8269, and with him two hundred H3967 and fourscore H8084 thousand H0505.
017:016 And next H3027 him [was] Amasiah H6007 the son H1121 of Zichri H2147, who willingly offered H5068 (8693) himself unto the LORD H3068; and with him two hundred H3967 thousand H0505 mighty men H1368 of valour H2428.
017:017 And of Benjamin H1144; Eliada H0450 a mighty man H1368 of valour H2428, and with him armed men H5401 (8802) with bow H7198 and shield H4043 two hundred H3967 thousand H0505.
017:018 And next H3027 him [was] Jehozabad H3075, and with him an hundred H3967 and fourscore H8084 thousand H0505 ready prepared H2502 (8803) for the war H6635.
017:019 These waited H8334 (8764) on the king H4428, beside [those] whom the king H4428 put H5414 (8804) in the fenced H4013 cities H5892 throughout all Judah H3063.
018:001 ¶  Now Jehoshaphat H3092 had riches H6239 and honour H3519 in abundance H7230, and joined affinity H2859 (8691) with Ahab H0256.
018:002 And after H7093 [certain] years H8141 he went down H3381 (8799) to Ahab H0256 to Samaria H8111. And Ahab H0256 killed H2076 (8799) sheep H6629 and oxen H1241 for him in abundance H7230, and for the people H5971 that [he had] with him, and persuaded H5496 (8686) him to go up H5927 (8800) [with him] to Ramothgilead H7433 H1568.
018:003 And Ahab H0256 king H4428 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto Jehoshaphat H3092 king H4428 of Judah H3063, Wilt thou go H3212 (8799) with me to Ramothgilead H7433 H1568? And he answered H0559 (8799) him, I [am] as thou [art], and my people H5971 as thy people H5971; and [we will be] with thee in the war H4421.
018:004 And Jehoshaphat H3092 said H0559 (8799) unto the king H4428 of Israel H3478, Enquire H1875 (8798), I pray thee, at the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 to day H3117.
018:005 Therefore the king H4428 of Israel H3478 gathered together H6908 (8799) of prophets H5030 four H0702 hundred H3967 men H0376, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Shall we go H3212 (8799) to Ramothgilead H7433 H1568 to battle H4421, or shall I forbear H2308 (8799)? And they said H0559 (8799), Go up H5927 (8798); for God H0430 will deliver H5414 (8799) [it] into the king’s H4428 hand H3027.
018:006 But Jehoshaphat H3092 said H0559 (8799), [Is there] not here a prophet H5030 of the LORD H3068 besides, that we might enquire H1875 (8799) of him?
018:007 And the king H4428 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto Jehoshaphat H3092, [There is] yet one H0259 man H0376, by whom we may enquire H1875 (8800) of the LORD H3068: but I hate H8130 (8804) him; for he never prophesied H5012 (8693) good H2896 unto me, but always H3117 evil H7451: the same [is] Micaiah H4321 the son H1121 of Imla H3229. And Jehoshaphat H3092 said H0559 (8799), Let not the king H4428 say H0559 (8799) so.
018:008 And the king H4428 of Israel H3478 called H7121 (8799) for one H0259 [of his] officers H5631, and said H0559 (8799), Fetch quickly H4116 (8761) Micaiah H4319 the son H1121 of Imla H3229.
018:009 And the king H4428 of Israel H3478 and Jehoshaphat H3092 king H4428 of Judah H3063 sat H3427 (8802) either H0376 of them on his throne H3678, clothed H3847 (8794) in [their] robes H0899, and they sat H3427 (8802) in a void place H1637 at the entering in H6607 of the gate H8179 of Samaria H8111; and all the prophets H5030 prophesied H5012 (8693) before H6440 them.
018:010 And Zedekiah H6667 the son H1121 of Chenaanah H3668 had made H6213 (8799) him horns H7161 of iron H1270, and said H0559 (8799), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, With these thou shalt push H5055 (8762) Syria H0758 until they be consumed H3615 (8763).
018:011 And all the prophets H5030 prophesied H5012 (8737) so, saying H0559 (8800), Go up H5927 (8798) to Ramothgilead H7433 H1568, and prosper H6743 (8685): for the LORD H3068 shall deliver H5414 (8804) [it] into the hand H3027 of the king H4428.
018:012 And the messenger H4397 that went H1980 (8804) to call H7121 (8800) Micaiah H4321 spake H1696 (8765) to him, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, the words H1697 of the prophets H5030 [declare] good H2896 to the king H4428 with one H0259 assent H6310; let thy word H1697 therefore, I pray thee, be like one H0259 of theirs, and speak H1696 (8765) thou good H2896.
018:013 And Micaiah H4321 said H0559 (8799), [As] the LORD H3068 liveth H2416, even what my God H0430 saith H0559 (8799), that will I speak H1696 (8762).
018:014 And when he was come H0935 (8799) to the king H4428, the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Micaiah H4318, shall we go H3212 (8799) to Ramothgilead H7433 H1568 to battle H4421, or shall I forbear H2308 (8799)? And he said H0559 (8799), Go ye up H5927 (8798), and prosper H6743 (8685), and they shall be delivered H5414 (8735) into your hand H3027.
018:015 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) to him, How many times H6471 shall I adjure H7650 (8688) thee that thou say H1696 (8762) nothing but the truth H0571 to me in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068?
018:016 Then he said H0559 (8799), I did see H7200 (8804) all Israel H3478 scattered H6327 (8737) upon the mountains H2022, as sheep H6629 that have no shepherd H7462 (8802): and the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), These have no master H0113; let them return H7725 (8799) [therefore] every man H0376 to his house H1004 in peace H7965.
018:017 And the king H4428 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) to Jehoshaphat H3092, Did I not tell H0559 (8804) thee [that] he would not prophesy H5012 (8691) good H2896 unto me, but evil H7451?
018:018 Again he said H0559 (8799), Therefore hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068; I saw H7200 (8804) the LORD H3068 sitting H3427 (8802) upon his throne H3678, and all the host H6635 of heaven H8064 standing H5975 (8802) on his right hand H3225 and [on] his left H8040.
018:019 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Who shall entice H6601 (8762) Ahab H0256 king H4428 of Israel H3478, that he may go up H5927 (8799) and fall H5307 (8799) at Ramothgilead H7433 H1568? And one spake H0559 (8799) saying H0559 (8802) after this manner H3602, and another saying H0559 (8802) after that manner H3602.
018:020 Then there came out H3318 (8799) a spirit H7307, and stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), I will entice H6601 (8762) him. And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Wherewith?
018:021 And he said H0559 (8799), I will go out H3318 (8799), and be a lying H8267 spirit H7307 in the mouth H6310 of all his prophets H5030. And [the LORD] said H0559 (8799), Thou shalt entice H6601 (8762) [him], and thou shalt also prevail H3201 (8799): go out H3318 (8798), and do H6213 (8798) [even] so.
018:022 Now therefore, behold, the LORD H3068 hath put H5414 (8804) a lying H8267 spirit H7307 in the mouth H6310 of these thy prophets H5030, and the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) evil H7451 against thee.
018:023 Then Zedekiah H6667 the son H1121 of Chenaanah H3668 came near H5066 (8799), and smote H5221 (8686) Micaiah H4321 upon the cheek H3895, and said H0559 (8799), Which H0335 way H1870 went H5674 (8804) the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 from me to speak H1696 (8763) unto thee?
018:024 And Micaiah H4321 said H0559 (8799), Behold, thou shalt see H7200 (8802) on that day H3117 when thou shalt go H0935 (8799) into an inner H2315 chamber H2315 to hide H2244 (8736) thyself.
018:025 Then the king H4428 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799), Take H3947 (8798) ye Micaiah H4321, and carry him back H7725 (8685) to Amon H0526 the governor H8269 of the city H5892, and to Joash H3101 the king’s H4428 son H1121;
018:026 And say H0559 (8804), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the king H4428, Put H7760 (8798) this [fellow] in the prison H1004 H3608, and feed H0398 (8685) him with bread H3899 of affliction H3906 and with water H4325 of affliction H3906, until I return H7725 (8800) in peace H7965.
018:027 And Micaiah H4321 said H0559 (8799), If thou certainly H7725 (8800) return H7725 (8799) in peace H7965, [then] hath not the LORD H3068 spoken H1696 (8765) by me. And he said H0559 (8799), Hearken H8085 (8798), all ye people H5971.
018:028 So the king H4428 of Israel H3478 and Jehoshaphat H3092 the king H4428 of Judah H3063 went up H5927 (8799) to Ramothgilead H7433 H1568.
018:029 And the king H4428 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto Jehoshaphat H3092, I will disguise H2664 (8692) myself, and will go H0935 (8800) to the battle H4421; but put H3847 (8798) thou on thy robes H0899. So the king H4428 of Israel H3478 disguised H2664 (8691) himself; and they went H0935 (8799) to the battle H4421.
018:030 Now the king H4428 of Syria H0758 had commanded H6680 (8765) the captains H8269 of the chariots H7393 that [were] with him, saying H0559 (8800), Fight H3898 (8735) ye not with small H6996 or great H1419, save only with the king H4428 of Israel H3478.
018:031 And it came to pass, when the captains H8269 of the chariots H7393 saw H7200 (8800) Jehoshaphat H3092, that they said H0559 (8804), It [is] the king H4428 of Israel H3478. Therefore they compassed about H5437 (8799) him to fight H3898 (8736): but Jehoshaphat H3092 cried out H2199 (8799), and the LORD H3068 helped H5826 (8804) him; and God H0430 moved H5496 (8686) them [to depart] from him.
018:032 For it came to pass, that, when the captains H8269 of the chariots H7393 perceived H7200 (8800) that it was not the king H4428 of Israel H3478, they turned back again H7725 (8799) from pursuing H0310 him.
018:033 And a [certain] man drew H4900 (8804) a bow H7198 at a venture H8537, and smote H5221 (8686) the king H4428 of Israel H3478 between the joints H1694 of the harness H8302: therefore he said H0559 (8799) to his chariot H7395 man H0376, Turn H2015 (8798) thine hand H3027, that thou mayest carry me out H3318 (8689) of the host H4264; for I am wounded H2470 (8717).
018:034 And the battle H4421 increased H5927 (8799) that day H3117: howbeit the king H4428 of Israel H3478 stayed [himself] up H5975 (8689) in [his] chariot H4818 against H5227 the Syrians H0758 until the even H6153: and about the time H6256 of the sun H8121 going down H0935 (8800) he died H4191 (8799).
019:001 ¶  And Jehoshaphat H3092 the king H4428 of Judah H3063 returned H7725 (8799) to his house H1004 in peace H7965 to Jerusalem H3389.
019:002 And Jehu H3058 the son H1121 of Hanani H2607 the seer H2374 went out H3318 (8799) to meet H6440 him, and said H0559 (8799) to king H4428 Jehoshaphat H3092, Shouldest thou help H5826 (8800) the ungodly H7563, and love H0157 (8799) them that hate H8130 (8802) the LORD H3068? therefore H2063 [is] wrath H7110 upon thee from before H6440 the LORD H3068.
019:003 Nevertheless H0061 there are good H2896 things H1697 found H4672 (8738) in thee, in that thou hast taken away H1197 (8765) the groves H0842 out of the land H0776, and hast prepared H3559 (8689) thine heart H3824 to seek H1875 (8800) God H0430.
019:004 And Jehoshaphat H3092 dwelt H3427 (8799) at Jerusalem H3389: and he went out H3318 (8799) again H7725 (8799) through the people H5971 from Beersheba H0884 to mount H2022 Ephraim H0669, and brought them back H7725 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001.
019:005 And he set H5975 (8686) judges H8199 (8802) in the land H0776 throughout all the fenced H1219 (8803) cities H5892 of Judah H3063, city H5892 by city H5892,
019:006 And said H0559 (8799) to the judges H8199 (8802), Take heed H7200 (8798) what ye do H6213 (8802): for ye judge H8199 (8799) not for man H0120, but for the LORD H3068, who [is] with you in the judgment H1697 H4941.
019:007 Wherefore now let the fear H6343 of the LORD H3068 be upon you; take heed H8104 (8798) and do H6213 (8798) [it]: for [there is] no iniquity H5766 with the LORD H3068 our God H0430, nor respect H4856 of persons H6440, nor taking H4727 of gifts H7810.
019:008 Moreover in Jerusalem H3389 did Jehoshaphat H3092 set H5975 (8689) of the Levites H3881, and [of] the priests H3548, and of the chief H7218 of the fathers H0001 of Israel H3478, for the judgment H4941 of the LORD H3068, and for controversies H7379, when they returned H7725 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
019:009 And he charged H6680 (8762) them, saying H0559 (8800), Thus shall ye do H6213 (8799) in the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068, faithfully H0530, and with a perfect H8003 heart H3824.
019:010 And what cause H7379 soever shall come H0935 (8799) to you of your brethren H0251 that dwell H3427 (8802) in their cities H5892, between blood H1818 and blood H1818, between law H8451 and commandment H4687, statutes H2706 and judgments H4941, ye shall even warn H2094 (8689) them that they trespass H0816 (8799) not against the LORD H3068, and [so] wrath H7110 come upon you, and upon your brethren H0251: this H3541 do H6213 (8799), and ye shall not trespass H0816 (8799).
019:011 And, behold, Amariah H0568 the chief H7218 priest H3548 [is] over you in all matters H1697 of the LORD H3068; and Zebadiah H2069 the son H1121 of Ishmael H3458, the ruler H5057 of the house H1004 of Judah H3063, for all the king’s H4428 matters H1697: also the Levites H3881 [shall be] officers H7860 (8802) before H6440 you. Deal H6213 (8798) courageously H2388 (8798), and the LORD H3068 shall be with the good H2896.
020:001 ¶  It came to pass after this H0310 also, [that] the children H1121 of Moab H4124, and the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and with them [other] beside the Ammonites H5984, came H0935 (8804) against Jehoshaphat H3092 to battle H4421.
020:002 Then there came H0935 (8799) some that told H5046 (8686) Jehoshaphat H3092, saying H0559 (8800), There cometh H0935 (8802) a great H7227 multitude H1995 against thee from beyond H5676 the sea H3220 on this side Syria H0758; and, behold, they [be] in Hazazontamar H2688, which [is] Engedi H5872.
020:003 And Jehoshaphat H3092 feared H3372 (8799), and set H5414 (8799) himself H6440 to seek H1875 (8800) the LORD H3068, and proclaimed H7121 (8799) a fast H6685 throughout H5921 all Judah H3063.
020:004 And Judah H3063 gathered themselves together H6908 (8735), to ask H1245 (8763) [help] of the LORD H3068: even out of all the cities H5892 of Judah H3063 they came H0935 (8804) to seek H1245 (8763) the LORD H3068.
020:005 And Jehoshaphat H3092 stood H5975 (8799) in the congregation H6951 of Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, before H6440 the new H2319 court H2691,
020:006 And said H0559 (8799), O LORD H3068 God H0430 of our fathers H0001, [art] not thou God H0430 in heaven H8064? and rulest H4910 (8802) [not] thou over all the kingdoms H4467 of the heathen H1471? and in thine hand H3027 [is there not] power H3581 and might H1369, so that none is able to withstand H3320 (8692) thee?
020:007 [Art] not thou our God H0430, [who] didst drive out H3423 (8689) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of this land H0776 before H6440 thy people H5971 Israel H3478, and gavest H5414 (8799) it to the seed H2233 of Abraham H0085 thy friend H0157 (8802) for ever H5769?
020:008 And they dwelt H3427 (8799) therein, and have built H1129 (8799) thee a sanctuary H4720 therein for thy name H8034, saying H0559 (8800),
020:009 If, [when] evil H7451 cometh H0935 (8799) upon us, [as] the sword H2719, judgment H8196, or pestilence H1698, or famine H7458, we stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 this house H1004, and in thy presence H6440, (for thy name H8034 [is] in this house H1004,) and cry H2199 (8799) unto thee in our affliction H6869, then thou wilt hear H8085 (8799) and help H3467 (8686).
020:010 And now, behold, the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 and Moab H4124 and mount H2022 Seir H8165, whom thou wouldest not let H5414 (8804) Israel H3478 invade H0935 (8800), when they came out H0935 (8800) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, but they turned H5493 (8804) from them, and destroyed H8045 (8689) them not;
020:011 Behold, [I say, how] they reward H1580 (8802) us, to come H0935 (8800) to cast us out H1644 (8763) of thy possession H3425, which thou hast given us to inherit H3423 (8689).
020:012 O our God H0430, wilt thou not judge H8199 (8799) them? for we have no might H3581 against H6440 this great H7227 company H1995 that cometh H0935 (8802) against us; neither know H3045 (8799) we H0587 what to do H6213 (8799): but our eyes H5869 [are] upon thee.
020:013 And all Judah H3063 stood H5975 (8802) before H6440 the LORD H3068, with H1571 their little ones H2945, their wives H0802, and their children H1121.
020:014 Then upon Jahaziel H3166 the son H1121 of Zechariah H2148, the son H1121 of Benaiah H1141, the son H1121 of Jeiel H3273, the son H1121 of Mattaniah H4983, a Levite H3881 of the sons H1121 of Asaph H0623, came the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 in the midst H8432 of the congregation H6951;
020:015 And he said H0559 (8799), Hearken H7181 (8685) ye, all Judah H3063, and ye inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, and thou king H4428 Jehoshaphat H3092, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 unto you, Be not afraid H3372 (8799) nor dismayed H2865 (8735) by reason H6440 of this great H7227 multitude H1995; for the battle H4421 [is] not yours, but God’s H0430.
020:016 To morrow H4279 go ye down H3381 (8798) against them: behold, they come up H5927 (8802) by the cliff H4608 of Ziz H6732; and ye shall find H4672 (8804) them at the end H5490 of the brook H5158, before H6440 the wilderness H4057 of Jeruel H3385.
020:017 Ye shall not [need] to fight H3898 (8736) in this H2063 [battle]: set H3320 (8690) yourselves, stand H5975 (8798) ye [still], and see H7200 (8798) the salvation H3444 of the LORD H3068 with you, O Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389: fear H3372 (8799) not, nor be dismayed H2865 (8735); to morrow H4279 go out H3318 (8798) against H6440 them: for the LORD H3068 [will be] with you.
020:018 And Jehoshaphat H3092 bowed H6915 (8799) his head with [his] face H0639 to the ground H0776: and all Judah H3063 and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 fell H5307 (8804) before H6440 the LORD H3068, worshipping H7812 (8692) the LORD H3068.
020:019 And the Levites H3881, of the children H1121 of the Kohathites H6956, and of the children H1121 of the Korhites H7145, stood up H6965 (8799) to praise H1984 (8763) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 with a loud H1419 voice H6963 on high H4605.
020:020 And they rose early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and went forth H3318 (8799) into the wilderness H4057 of Tekoa H8620: and as they went forth H3318 (8800), Jehoshaphat H3092 stood H5975 (8804) and said H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798) me, O Judah H3063, and ye inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389; Believe H0539 (8685) in the LORD H3068 your God H0430, so shall ye be established H0539 (8735); believe H0539 (8685) his prophets H5030, so shall ye prosper H6743 (8685).
020:021 And when he had consulted H3289 (8735) with the people H5971, he appointed H5975 (8686) singers H7891 (8789) unto the LORD H3068, and that should praise H1984 (8764) the beauty H1927 of holiness H6944, as they went out H3318 (8800) before H6440 the army H2502 (8803), and to say H0559 (8802), Praise H3034 (8685) the LORD H3068; for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
020:022 And when H6256 they began H2490 (8689) to sing H7440 and to praise H8416, the LORD H3068 set H5414 (8804) ambushments H0693 (8764) against the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, Moab H4124, and mount H2022 Seir H8165, which were come H0935 (8802) against Judah H3063; and they were smitten H5062 (8735).
020:023 For the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 and Moab H4124 stood up H5975 (8799) against the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of mount H2022 Seir H8165, utterly to slay H2763 (8687) and destroy H8045 (8687) [them]: and when they had made an end H3615 (8763) of the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Seir H8165, every one H0376 helped H5826 (8804) to destroy H4889 another H7453.
020:024 And when Judah H3063 came H0935 (8804) toward the watch tower H4707 (8677) H4708 in the wilderness H4057, they looked H6437 (8799) unto the multitude H1995, and, behold, they [were] dead bodies H6297 fallen H5307 (8802) to the earth H0776, and none escaped H6413.
020:025 And when Jehoshaphat H3092 and his people H5971 came H0935 (8799) to take away H0962 (8800) the spoil H7998 of them, they found H4672 (8799) among them in abundance H7230 both riches H7399 with the dead bodies H6297, and precious H2532 jewels H3627, which they stripped off H5337 (8762) for themselves, more than H0369 they could carry away H4853: and they were three H7969 days H3117 in gathering H0962 (8802) of the spoil H7998, it was so much H7227.
020:026 And on the fourth H7243 day H3117 they assembled H6950 (8738) themselves in the valley H6010 of Berachah H1294; for there they blessed H1288 (8765) the LORD H3068: therefore the name H8034 of the same place H4725 was called H7121 (8804), The valley H6010 of Berachah H1294, unto this day H3117.
020:027 Then they returned H7725 (8799), every man H0376 of Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, and Jehoshaphat H3092 in the forefront H7218 of them, to go again H7725 (8800) to Jerusalem H3389 with joy H8057; for the LORD H3068 had made them to rejoice H8055 (8765) over their enemies H0341 (8802).
020:028 And they came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389 with psalteries H5035 and harps H3658 and trumpets H2689 unto the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
020:029 And the fear H6343 of God H0430 was on all the kingdoms H4467 of [those] countries H0776, when they had heard H8085 (8800) that the LORD H3068 fought H3898 (8738) against the enemies H0341 (8802) of Israel H3478.
020:030 So the realm H4438 of Jehoshaphat H3092 was quiet H8252 (8799): for his God H0430 gave him rest H5117 (8799) round about H5439.
020:031 And Jehoshaphat H3092 reigned H4427 (8799) over Judah H3063: [he was] thirty H7970 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) twenty H6242 and five H2568 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Azubah H5806 the daughter H1323 of Shilhi H7977.
020:032 And he walked H3212 (8799) in the way H1870 of Asa H0609 his father H0001, and departed H5493 (8804) not from it, doing H6213 (8800) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068.
020:033 Howbeit the high places H1116 were not taken away H5493 (8804): for as yet the people H5971 had not prepared H3559 (8689) their hearts H3824 unto the God H0430 of their fathers H0001.
020:034 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Jehoshaphat H3092, first H7223 and last H0314, behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H1697 of Jehu H3058 the son H1121 of Hanani H2607, who [is] mentioned H5927 (8717) in the book H5612 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478.
020:035 And after H0310 this did Jehoshaphat H3092 king H4428 of Judah H3063 join H2266 (8694) himself with Ahaziah H0274 king H4428 of Israel H3478, who did H6213 (8800) very wickedly H7561 (8689):
020:036 And he joined H2266 (8762) himself with him to make H6213 (8800) ships H0591 to go H3212 (8800) to Tarshish H8659: and they made H6213 (8799) the ships H0591 in Eziongeber H6100.
020:037 Then Eliezer H0461 the son H1121 of Dodavah H1735 of Mareshah H4762 prophesied H5012 (8691) against Jehoshaphat H3092, saying H0559 (8800), Because thou hast joined H2266 (8692) thyself with Ahaziah H0274, the LORD H3068 hath broken H6555 (8804) thy works H4639. And the ships H0591 were broken H7665 (8735), that they were not able H6113 (8804) to go H3212 (8800) to Tarshish H8659.
021:001 ¶  Now Jehoshaphat H3092 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and was buried H6912 (8735) with his fathers H0001 in the city H5892 of David H1732. And Jehoram H3088 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
021:002 And he had brethren H0251 the sons H1121 of Jehoshaphat H3092, Azariah H5838, and Jehiel H3171, and Zechariah H2148, and Azariah H5838, and Michael H4317, and Shephatiah H8203: all these [were] the sons H1121 of Jehoshaphat H3092 king H4428 of Israel H3478.
021:003 And their father H0001 gave H5414 (8799) them great H7227 gifts H4979 of silver H3701, and of gold H2091, and of precious things H4030, with fenced H4694 cities H5892 in Judah H3063: but the kingdom H4467 gave H5414 (8804) he to Jehoram H3088; because he [was] the firstborn H1060.
021:004 Now when Jehoram H3088 was risen up H6965 (8799) to the kingdom H4467 of his father H0001, he strengthened H2388 (8691) himself, and slew H2026 (8799) all his brethren H0251 with the sword H2719, and [divers] also of the princes H8269 of Israel H3478.
021:005 Jehoram H3088 [was] thirty H7970 and two H8147 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) eight H8083 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389.
021:006 And he walked H3212 (8799) in the way H1870 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478, like as did H6213 (8804) the house H1004 of Ahab H0256: for he had the daughter H1323 of Ahab H0256 to wife H0802: and he wrought H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068.
021:007 Howbeit the LORD H3068 would H0014 (8804) not destroy H7843 (8687) the house H1004 of David H1732, because of the covenant H1285 that he had made H3772 (8804) with David H1732, and as he promised H0559 (8804) to give H5414 (8800) a light H5216 to him and to his sons H1121 for ever H3117.
021:008 In his days H3117 the Edomites H0123 revolted H6586 (8804) from under the dominion H3027 of Judah H3063, and made H4427 (8686) themselves a king H4428.
021:009 Then Jehoram H3088 went forth H5674 (8799) with his princes H8269, and all his chariots H7393 with him: and he rose up H6965 (8804) by night H3915, and smote H5221 (8686) the Edomites H0123 which compassed him in H5437 (8802), and the captains H8269 of the chariots H7393.
021:010 So the Edomites H0123 revolted H6586 (8799) from under the hand H3027 of Judah H3063 unto this day H3117. The same time H6256 [also] did Libnah H3841 revolt H6586 (8799) from under his hand H3027; because he had forsaken H5800 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of his fathers H0001.
021:011 Moreover he made H6213 (8804) high places H1116 in the mountains H2022 of Judah H3063, and caused the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 to commit fornication H2181 (8686), and compelled H5080 (8686) Judah H3063 [thereto].
021:012 And there came H0935 (8799) a writing H4385 to him from Elijah H0452 the prophet H5030, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of David H1732 thy father H0001, Because thou hast not walked H1980 (8804) in the ways H1870 of Jehoshaphat H3092 thy father H0001, nor in the ways H1870 of Asa H0609 king H4428 of Judah H3063,
021:013 But hast walked H3212 (8799) in the way H1870 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478, and hast made Judah H3063 and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 to go a whoring H2181 (8686), like to the whoredoms H2181 (8687) of the house H1004 of Ahab H0256, and also hast slain H2026 (8804) thy brethren H0251 of thy father’s H0001 house H1004, [which were] better H2896 than thyself:
021:014 Behold, with a great H1419 plague H4046 will the LORD H3068 smite H5062 (8802) thy people H5971, and thy children H1121, and thy wives H0802, and all thy goods H7399:
021:015 And thou [shalt have] great H7227 sickness H2483 by disease H4245 of thy bowels H4578, until thy bowels H4578 fall out H3318 (8799) by reason of the sickness H2483 day H3117 by day H3117.
021:016 Moreover the LORD H3068 stirred up H5782 (8686) against Jehoram H3088 the spirit H7307 of the Philistines H6430, and of the Arabians H6163, that [were] near H5921 H3027 the Ethiopians H3569:
021:017 And they came up H5927 (8799) into Judah H3063, and brake H1234 (8799) into it, and carried away H7617 (8799) all the substance H7399 that was found H4672 (8737) in the king’s H4428 house H1004, and his sons H1121 also, and his wives H0802; so that there was never a son H1121 left H7604 (8738) him, save Jehoahaz H3059, the youngest H6996 of his sons H1121.
021:018 And after H0310 all this the LORD H3068 smote H5062 (8804) him in his bowels H4578 with an incurable H0369 H4832 disease H2483.
021:019 And it came to pass, that in process of time H3117, after H3318 (8800) H6256 the end H7093 of two H8147 years H3117, his bowels H4578 fell out H3318 (8804) by reason H5973 of his sickness H2483: so he died H4191 (8799) of sore H7451 diseases H8463. And his people H5971 made H6213 (8804) no burning H8316 for him, like the burning H8316 of his fathers H0001.
021:020 Thirty H7970 and two H8147 years old H1121 was he when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) in Jerusalem H3389 eight H8083 years H8141, and departed H3212 (8799) without being desired H2532. Howbeit they buried H6912 (8799) him in the city H5892 of David H1732, but not in the sepulchres H6913 of the kings H4428.
022:001 ¶  And the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 made H4427 Ahaziah H0274 his youngest H6996 son H1121 king H4427 (8686) in his stead: for the band of men H1416 that came H0935 (8802) with the Arabians H6163 to the camp H4264 had slain H2026 (8804) all the eldest H7223. So Ahaziah H0274 the son H1121 of Jehoram H3088 king H4428 of Judah H3063 reigned H4427 (8799).
022:002 Forty H0705 and two H8147 years H8141 old H1121 [was] Ahaziah H0274 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) one H0259 year H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. His mother’s H0517 name H8034 also [was] Athaliah H6271 the daughter H1323 of Omri H6018.
022:003 He also walked H1980 (8804) in the ways H1870 of the house H1004 of Ahab H0256: for his mother H0517 was his counsellor H3289 (8802) to do wickedly H7561 (8687).
022:004 Wherefore he did H6213 (8799) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 like the house H1004 of Ahab H0256: for they were his counsellors H3289 (8802) after H0310 the death H4194 of his father H0001 to his destruction H4889.
022:005 He walked H1980 (8804) also after their counsel H6098, and went H3212 (8799) with Jehoram H3088 the son H1121 of Ahab H0256 king H4428 of Israel H3478 to war H4421 against Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758 at Ramothgilead H7433 H1568: and the Syrians H7421 smote H5221 (8686) Joram H3141.
022:006 And he returned H7725 (8799) to be healed H7495 (8692) in Jezreel H3157 because of the wounds H4347 which were given H5221 (8689) him at Ramah H7414, when he fought H3898 (8736) with Hazael H2371 king H4428 of Syria H0758. And Azariah H5838 the son H1121 of Jehoram H3088 king H4428 of Judah H3063 went down H3381 (8804) to see H7200 (8800) Jehoram H3088 the son H1121 of Ahab H0256 at Jezreel H3157, because he was sick H2470 (8802).
022:007 And the destruction H8395 of Ahaziah H0274 was of God H0430 by coming H0935 (8800) to Joram H3141: for when he was come H0935 (8800), he went out H3318 (8804) with Jehoram H3088 against Jehu H3058 the son H1121 of Nimshi H5250, whom the LORD H3068 had anointed H4886 (8804) to cut off H3772 (8687) the house H1004 of Ahab H0256.
022:008 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu H3058 was executing judgment H8199 (8736) upon the house H1004 of Ahab H0256, and found H4672 (8799) the princes H8269 of Judah H3063, and the sons H1121 of the brethren H0251 of Ahaziah H0274, that ministered H8334 (8764) to Ahaziah H0274, he slew H2026 (8799) them.
022:009 And he sought H1245 (8762) Ahaziah H0274: and they caught H3920 (8799) him, (for he was hid H2244 (8693) in Samaria H8111,) and brought H0935 (8686) him to Jehu H3058: and when they had slain H4191 (8686) him, they buried H6912 (8799) him: Because, said H0559 (8804) they, he [is] the son H1121 of Jehoshaphat H3092, who sought H1875 (8804) the LORD H3068 with all his heart H3824. So the house H1004 of Ahaziah H0274 had no power H3581 to keep H6113 (8800) still the kingdom H4467.
022:010 But when Athaliah H6271 the mother H0517 of Ahaziah H0274 saw H7200 (8804) that her son H1121 was dead H4191 (8804), she arose H6965 (8799) and destroyed H1696 (8762) all the seed H2233 royal H4467 of the house H1004 of Judah H3063.
022:011 But Jehoshabeath H3090, the daughter H1323 of the king H4428, took H3947 (8799) Joash H3101 the son H1121 of Ahaziah H0274, and stole H1589 (8799) him from among H8432 the king’s H4428 sons H1121 that were slain H4191 (8716), and put H5414 (8799) him and his nurse H3243 (8688) in a bedchamber H2315 H4296. So Jehoshabeath H3090, the daughter H1323 of king H4428 Jehoram H3088, the wife H0802 of Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548, (for she was the sister H0269 of Ahaziah H0274,) hid H5641 (8686) him from H6440 Athaliah H6271, so that she slew H4191 (8689) him not.
022:012 And he was with them hid H2244 (8693) in the house H1004 of God H0430 six H8337 years H8141: and Athaliah H6271 reigned H4427 (8802) over the land H0776.
023:001 ¶  And in the seventh H7637 year H8141 Jehoiada H3077 strengthened H2388 (8694) himself, and took H3947 (8799) the captains H8269 of hundreds H3967, Azariah H5838 the son H1121 of Jeroham H3395, and Ishmael H3458 the son H1121 of Jehohanan H3076, and Azariah H5838 the son H1121 of Obed H5744, and Maaseiah H4641 the son H1121 of Adaiah H5718, and Elishaphat H0478 the son H1121 of Zichri H2147, into covenant H1285 with him.
023:002 And they went about H5437 (8799) in Judah H3063, and gathered H6908 (8799) the Levites H3881 out of all the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and the chief H7218 of the fathers H0001 of Israel H3478, and they came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
023:003 And all the congregation H6951 made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 with the king H4428 in the house H1004 of God H0430. And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Behold, the king’s H4428 son H1121 shall reign H4427 (8799), as the LORD H3068 hath said H1696 (8765) of the sons H1121 of David H1732.
023:004 This [is] the thing H1697 that ye shall do H6213 (8799); A third part H7992 of you entering H0935 (8802) on the sabbath H7676, of the priests H3548 and of the Levites H3881, [shall be] porters H7778 of the doors H5592;
023:005 And a third part H7992 [shall be] at the king’s H4428 house H1004; and a third part H7992 at the gate H8179 of the foundation H3247: and all the people H5971 [shall be] in the courts H2691 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
023:006 But let none come H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, save the priests H3548, and they that minister H8334 (8764) of the Levites H3881; they shall go in H0935 (8799), for they [are] holy H6944: but all the people H5971 shall keep H8104 (8799) the watch H4931 of the LORD H3068.
023:007 And the Levites H3881 shall compass H5362 (8689) the king H4428 round about H5439, every man H0376 with his weapons H3627 in his hand H3027; and whosoever [else] cometh H0935 (8802) into the house H1004, he shall be put to death H4191 (8714): but be ye with the king H4428 when he cometh in H0935 (8800), and when he goeth out H3318 (8800).
023:008 So the Levites H3881 and all Judah H3063 did H6213 (8799) according to all things that Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548 had commanded H6680 (8765), and took H3947 (8799) every man H0376 his men H0582 that were to come in H0935 (8802) on the sabbath H7676, with them that were to go H3318 (8802) [out] on the sabbath H7676: for Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548 dismissed H6358 (8804) not the courses H4256.
023:009 Moreover Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548 delivered H5414 (8799) to the captains H8269 of hundreds H3967 spears H2595, and bucklers H4043, and shields H7982, that [had been] king H4428 David’s H1732, which [were] in the house H1004 of God H0430.
023:010 And he set H5975 (8686) all the people H5971, every man H0376 having his weapon H7973 in his hand H3027, from the right H3233 side H3802 of the temple H1004 to the left H8042 side H3802 of the temple H1004, along by the altar H4196 and the temple H1004, by the king H4428 round about H5439.
023:011 Then they brought out H3318 (8686) the king’s H4428 son H1121, and put H5414 (8799) upon him the crown H5145, and [gave him] the testimony H5715, and made him king H4427 (8686). And Jehoiada H3077 and his sons H1121 anointed H4886 (8799) him, and said H0559 (8799), God save H2421 (8799) the king H4428.
023:012 Now when Athaliah H6271 heard H8085 (8799) the noise H6963 of the people H5971 running H7323 (8801) and praising H1984 (8764) the king H4428, she came H0935 (8799) to the people H5971 into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068:
023:013 And she looked H7200 (8799), and, behold, the king H4428 stood H5975 (8802) at his pillar H5982 at the entering in H3996, and the princes H8269 and the trumpets H2689 by the king H4428: and all the people H5971 of the land H0776 rejoiced H8056, and sounded H8628 (8802) with trumpets H2689, also the singers H7891 (8789) with instruments H3627 of musick H7892, and such as taught H3045 (8688) to sing praise H1984 (8763). Then Athaliah H6271 rent H7167 (8799) her clothes H0899, and said H0559 (8799), Treason H7195, Treason H7195.
023:014 Then Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548 brought out H3318 (8686) the captains H8269 of hundreds H3967 that were set over H6485 (8803) the host H2428, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Have her forth H3318 (8685) of the ranges H1004 H7713: and whoso followeth H0935 (8802) H0310 her, let him be slain H4191 (8714) with the sword H2719. For the priest H3548 said H0559 (8804), Slay H4191 (8686) her not in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
023:015 So they laid H7760 (8799) hands H3027 on her; and when she was come H0935 (8799) to the entering H3996 of the horse H5483 gate H8179 by the king’s H4428 house H1004, they slew H4191 (8686) her there.
023:016 And Jehoiada H3077 made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 between him, and between all the people H5971, and between the king H4428, that they should be the LORD’S H3068 people H5971.
023:017 Then all the people H5971 went H0935 (8799) to the house H1004 of Baal H1168, and brake it down H5422 (8799), and brake H7665 his altars H4196 and his images H6754 in pieces H7665 (8765), and slew H2026 (8804) Mattan H4977 the priest H3548 of Baal H1168 before H6440 the altars H4196.
023:018 Also Jehoiada H3077 appointed H7760 (8799) the offices H6486 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 by the hand H3027 of the priests H3548 the Levites H3881, whom David H1732 had distributed H2505 (8804) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, to offer H5927 (8687) the burnt offerings H5930 of the LORD H3068, as [it is] written H3789 (8803) in the law H8451 of Moses H4872, with rejoicing H8057 and with singing H7892, [as it was ordained] by H3027 David H1732.
023:019 And he set H5975 (8686) the porters H7778 at the gates H8179 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, that none [which was] unclean H2931 in any thing H1697 should enter in H0935 (8799).
023:020 And he took H3947 (8799) the captains H8269 of hundreds H3967, and the nobles H0117, and the governors H4910 (8802) of the people H5971, and all the people H5971 of the land H0776, and brought down H3381 (8686) the king H4428 from the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: and they came H0935 (8799) through H8432 the high H5945 gate H8179 into the king’s H4428 house H1004, and set H3427 (8686) the king H4428 upon the throne H3678 of the kingdom H4467.
023:021 And all the people H5971 of the land H0776 rejoiced H8055 (8799): and the city H5892 was quiet H8252 (8804), after that they had slain H4191 (8689) Athaliah H6271 with the sword H2719.
024:001 ¶  Joash H3101 [was] seven H7651 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) forty H0705 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. His mother’s H0517 name H8034 also [was] Zibiah H6645 of Beersheba H0884.
024:002 And Joash H3101 did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 all the days H3117 of Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548.
024:003 And Jehoiada H3077 took H5375 (8799) for him two H8147 wives H0802; and he begat H3205 (8686) sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
024:004 And it came to pass after H0310 this, [that] Joash H3101 was minded H3820 to repair H2318 (8763) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
024:005 And he gathered together H6908 (8799) the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881, and said H0559 (8799) to them, Go out H3318 (8798) unto the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and gather H6908 (8798) of all Israel H3478 money H3701 to repair H2388 (8763) the house H1004 of your God H0430 from H1767 year H8141 to year H8141, and see that ye hasten H4116 (8762) the matter H1697. Howbeit the Levites H3881 hastened H4116 (8765) [it] not.
024:006 And the king H4428 called H7121 (8799) for Jehoiada H3077 the chief H7218, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Why hast thou not required H1875 (8804) of the Levites H3881 to bring in H0935 (8687) out of Judah H3063 and out of Jerusalem H3389 the collection H4864, [according to the commandment] of Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068, and of the congregation H6951 of Israel H3478, for the tabernacle H0168 of witness H5715?
024:007 For the sons H1121 of Athaliah H6271, that wicked H4849 woman, had broken up H6555 (8804) the house H1004 of God H0430; and also all the dedicated things H6944 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 did they bestow H6213 (8804) upon Baalim H1168.
024:008 And at the king’s H4428 commandment H0559 (8799) they made H6213 (8799) a H0259 chest H0727, and set H5414 (8799) it without H2351 at the gate H8179 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
024:009 And they made H5414 (8799) a proclamation H6963 through Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, to bring in H0935 (8687) to the LORD H3068 the collection H4864 [that] Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of God H0430 [laid] upon Israel H3478 in the wilderness H4057.
024:010 And all the princes H8269 and all the people H5971 rejoiced H8055 (8799), and brought in H0935 (8686), and cast H7993 (8686) into the chest H0727, until they had made an end H3615 (8763).
024:011 Now it came to pass, that at what time H6256 the chest H0727 was brought H0935 (8686) unto the king’s H4428 office H6486 by the hand H3027 of the Levites H3881, and when they saw H7200 (8800) that [there was] much H7227 money H3701, the king’s H4428 scribe H5608 (8802) and the high H7218 priest’s H3548 officer H6496 came H0935 (8804) and emptied H6168 (8762) the chest H0727, and took H5375 (8799) it, and carried H7725 it to his place H4725 again H7725 (8686). Thus they did H6213 (8804) day H3117 by day H3117, and gathered H0622 (8799) money H3701 in abundance H7230.
024:012 And the king H4428 and Jehoiada H3077 gave H5414 (8799) it to such as did H6213 (8802) the work H4399 of the service H5656 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and hired H7936 (8802) masons H2672 (8802) and carpenters H2796 to repair H2318 (8763) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and also such as wrought H2796 iron H1270 and brass H5178 to mend H2388 (8763) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
024:013 So the workmen H4399 H6213 (8802) wrought H6213 (8799), and the work H4399 was H5927 (8799) perfected H0724 by them H3027, and they set H5975 (8686) the house H1004 of God H0430 in his state H4971, and strengthened H0553 (8762) it.
024:014 And when they had finished H3615 (8763) [it], they brought H0935 (8689) the rest H7605 of the money H3701 before H6440 the king H4428 and Jehoiada H3077, whereof were made H6213 (8799) vessels H3627 for the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, [even] vessels H3627 to minister H8335, and to offer H5927 (8687) [withal], and spoons H3709, and vessels H3627 of gold H2091 and silver H3701. And they offered H5927 (8688) burnt offerings H5930 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 continually H8548 all the days H3117 of Jehoiada H3077.
024:015 But Jehoiada H3077 waxed old H2204 (8799), and was full H7646 (8799) of days H3117 when he died H4191 (8799); an hundred H3967 and thirty H7970 years H8141 old H1121 [was he] when he died H4194.
024:016 And they buried H6912 (8799) him in the city H5892 of David H1732 among the kings H4428, because he had done H6213 (8804) good H2896 in Israel H3478, both toward God H0430, and toward his house H1004.
024:017 Now after H0310 the death H4194 of Jehoiada H3077 came H0935 (8804) the princes H8269 of Judah H3063, and made obeisance H7812 (8691) to the king H4428. Then the king H4428 hearkened H8085 (8804) unto them.
024:018 And they left H5800 (8799) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001, and served H5647 (8799) groves H0842 and idols H6091: and wrath H7110 came upon Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389 for this their trespass H0819.
024:019 Yet he sent H7971 (8799) prophets H5030 to them, to bring them again H7725 (8687) unto the LORD H3068; and they testified H5749 (8686) against them: but they would not give ear H0238 (8689).
024:020 And the Spirit H7307 of God H0430 came H3847 (8804) upon Zechariah H2148 the son H1121 of Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548, which stood H5975 (8799) above the people H5971, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) God H0430, Why transgress H5674 (8802) ye the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068, that ye cannot prosper H6743 (8686)? because ye have forsaken H5800 (8804) the LORD H3068, he hath also forsaken H5800 (8799) you.
024:021 And they conspired H7194 (8799) against him, and stoned H7275 (8799) him with stones H0068 at the commandment H4687 of the king H4428 in the court H2691 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
024:022 Thus Joash H3101 the king H4428 remembered H2142 (8804) not the kindness H2617 which Jehoiada H3077 his father H0001 had done H6213 (8804) to him, but slew H2026 (8799) his son H1121. And when he died H4194, he said H0559 (8804), The LORD H3068 look H7200 (8799) upon [it], and require H1875 (8799) [it].
024:023 And it came to pass at the end H8622 of the year H8141, [that] the host H2428 of Syria H0758 came up H5927 (8804) against him: and they came H0935 (8799) to Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, and destroyed H7843 (8686) all the princes H8269 of the people H5971 from among the people H5971, and sent H7971 (8765) all the spoil H7998 of them unto the king H4428 of Damascus H1834.
024:024 For the army H2428 of the Syrians H0758 came H0935 (8804) with a small H4705 company of men H0582, and the LORD H3068 delivered H5414 (8804) a very H3966 great H7230 host H2428 into their hand H3027, because they had forsaken H5800 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001. So they executed H6213 (8804) judgment H8201 against Joash H3101.
024:025 And when they were departed H3212 (8800) from him, (for they left H5800 (8804) him in great H7227 diseases H4251,) his own servants H5650 conspired H7194 (8694) against him for the blood H1818 of the sons H1121 of Jehoiada H3077 the priest H3548, and slew H2026 (8799) him on his bed H4296, and he died H4191 (8799): and they buried H6912 (8799) him in the city H5892 of David H1732, but they buried H6912 (8804) him not in the sepulchres H6913 of the kings H4428.
024:026 And these are they that conspired H7194 (8693) against him; Zabad H2066 the son H1121 of Shimeath H8100 an Ammonitess H5985, and Jehozabad H3075 the son H1121 of Shimrith H8116 a Moabitess H4125.
024:027 Now [concerning] his sons H1121, and the greatness H7235 (8799) (8675) H7230 of the burdens H4853 [laid] upon him, and the repairing H3247 of the house H1004 of God H0430, behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the story H4097 of the book H5612 of the kings H4428. And Amaziah H0558 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
025:001 ¶  Amaziah H0558 [was] twenty H6242 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 [when] he began to reign H4427 (8804), and he reigned H4427 (8804) twenty H6242 and nine H8672 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Jehoaddan H3086 of Jerusalem H3389.
025:002 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, but not with a perfect H8003 heart H3824.
025:003 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom H4467 was established H2388 (8804) to him, that he slew H2026 (8799) his servants H5650 that had killed H5221 (8688) the king H4428 his father H0001.
025:004 But he slew H4191 (8689) not their children H1121, but [did] as [it is] written H3789 (8803) in the law H8451 in the book H5612 of Moses H4872, where the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), The fathers H0001 shall not die H4191 (8799) for the children H1121, neither shall the children H1121 die H4191 (8799) for the fathers H0001, but every man H0376 shall die H4191 (8799) for his own sin H2399.
025:005 Moreover Amaziah H0558 gathered H6908 Judah H3063 together H6908 (8799), and made H5975 (8686) them captains H8269 over thousands H0505, and captains H8269 over hundreds H3967, according to the houses H1004 of [their] fathers H0001, throughout all Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144: and he numbered H6485 (8799) them from twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 and above H4605, and found H4672 (8799) them three H7969 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 choice H0977 (8803) [men, able] to go forth H3318 (8802) to war H6635, that could handle H0270 (8802) spear H7420 and shield H6793.
025:006 He hired H7936 (8799) also an hundred H3967 thousand H0505 mighty H1368 men of valour H2428 out of Israel H3478 for an hundred H3967 talents H3603 of silver H3701.
025:007 But there came H0935 (8804) a man H0376 of God H0430 to him, saying H0559 (8800), O king H4428, let not the army H6635 of Israel H3478 go H0935 (8799) with thee; for the LORD H3068 [is] not with Israel H3478, [to wit, with] all the children H1121 of Ephraim H0669.
025:008 But if thou wilt go H0935 (8798), do H6213 (8798) [it], be strong H2388 (8798) for the battle H4421: God H0430 shall make thee fall H3782 (8686) before H6440 the enemy H0341 (8802): for God H0430 hath H3426 power H3581 to help H5826 (8800), and to cast down H3782 (8687).
025:009 And Amaziah H0558 said H0559 (8799) to the man H0376 of God H0430, But what shall we do H6213 (8800) for the hundred H3967 talents H3603 which I have given H5414 (8804) to the army H1416 of Israel H3478? And the man H0376 of God H0430 answered H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 is H3426 able to give H5414 (8800) thee much more H7235 (8687) than this.
025:010 Then Amaziah H0558 separated H0914 (8686) them, [to wit], the army H1416 that was come H0935 (8804) to him out of Ephraim H0669, to go H3212 home H4725 again H3212 (8800): wherefore their anger H0639 was greatly H3966 kindled H2734 (8799) against Judah H3063, and they returned H7725 (8799) home H4725 in great H2750 anger H0639.
025:011 And Amaziah H0558 strengthened H2388 (8694) himself, and led forth H5090 (8799) his people H5971, and went H3212 (8799) to the valley H1516 of salt H4417, and smote H5221 (8686) of the children H1121 of Seir H8165 ten H6235 thousand H0505.
025:012 And [other] ten H6235 thousand H0505 [left] alive H2416 did the children H1121 of Judah H3063 carry away captive H7617 (8804), and brought H0935 (8686) them unto the top H7218 of the rock H5553, and cast them down H7993 (8686) from the top H7218 of the rock H5553, that they all were broken in pieces H1234 (8738).
025:013 But the soldiers H1121 of the army H1416 which Amaziah H0558 sent back H7725 (8689), that they should not go H3212 (8800) with him to battle H4421, fell H6584 (8799) upon the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, from Samaria H8111 even unto Bethhoron H1032, and smote H5221 (8686) three H7969 thousand H0505 of them, and took H0962 (8799) much H7227 spoil H0961.
025:014 Now it came to pass, after H0310 that Amaziah H0558 was come H0935 (8800) from the slaughter H5221 (8687) of the Edomites H0130, that he brought H0935 (8686) the gods H0430 of the children H1121 of Seir H8165, and set them up H5975 (8686) [to be] his gods H0430, and bowed down H7812 (8691) himself before H6440 them, and burned incense H6999 (8762) unto them.
025:015 Wherefore the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8799) against Amaziah H0558, and he sent H7971 (8799) unto him a prophet H5030, which said H0559 (8799) unto him, Why hast thou sought H1875 (8804) after the gods H0430 of the people H5971, which could not deliver H5337 (8689) their own people H5971 out of thine hand H3027?
025:016 And it came to pass, as he talked H1696 (8763) with him, that [the king] said H0559 (8799) unto him, Art thou made H5414 (8804) of the king’s H4428 counsel H3289 (8802)? forbear H2308 (8798); why shouldest thou be smitten H5221 (8686)? Then the prophet H5030 forbare H2308 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), I know H3045 (8804) that God H0430 hath determined H3289 (8804) to destroy H7843 (8687) thee, because thou hast done H6213 (8804) this, and hast not hearkened H8085 (8804) unto my counsel H6098.
025:017 Then Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063 took advice H3289 (8735), and sent H7971 (8799) to Joash H3101, the son H1121 of Jehoahaz H3059, the son H1121 of Jehu H3058, king H4428 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), Come H3212 (8798), let us see one another H7200 (8691) in the face H6440.
025:018 And Joash H3101 king H4428 of Israel H3478 sent H7971 (8799) to Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800), The thistle H2336 that [was] in Lebanon H3844 sent H7971 (8804) to the cedar H0730 that [was] in Lebanon H3844, saying H0559 (8800), Give H5414 (8798) thy daughter H1323 to my son H1121 to wife H0802: and there passed by H5674 (8799) a wild H7704 beast H2416 that [was] in Lebanon H3844, and trode down H7429 (8799) the thistle H2336.
025:019 Thou sayest H0559 (8804), Lo, thou hast smitten H5221 (8689) the Edomites H0123; and thine heart H3820 lifteth thee up H5375 (8804) to boast H3513 (8687): abide H3427 (8798) now at home H1004; why shouldest thou meddle H1624 (8691) to [thine] hurt H7451, that thou shouldest fall H5307 (8804), [even] thou, and Judah H3063 with thee?
025:020 But Amaziah H0558 would not hear H8085 (8804); for it [came] of God H0430, that he might deliver H5414 (8800) them into the hand H3027 [of their enemies], because they sought H1875 (8804) after the gods H0430 of Edom H0123.
025:021 So Joash H3101 the king H4428 of Israel H3478 went up H5927 (8799); and they saw one another H7200 (8691) in the face H6440, [both] he and Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063, at Bethshemesh H1053, which [belongeth] to Judah H3063.
025:022 And Judah H3063 was put to the worse H5062 (8735) before H6440 Israel H3478, and they fled H5127 (8799) every man H0376 to his tent H0168.
025:023 And Joash H3101 the king H4428 of Israel H3478 took H8610 (8804) Amaziah H0558 king H4428 of Judah H3063, the son H1121 of Joash H3101, the son H1121 of Jehoahaz H3059, at Bethshemesh H1053, and brought H0935 (8686) him to Jerusalem H3389, and brake down H6555 (8799) the wall H2346 of Jerusalem H3389 from the gate H8179 of Ephraim H0669 to the corner H6437 (8802) gate H8179, four H0702 hundred H3967 cubits H0520.
025:024 And [he took] all the gold H2091 and the silver H3701, and all the vessels H3627 that were found H4672 (8737) in the house H1004 of God H0430 with Obededom H5654, and the treasures H0214 of the king’s H4428 house H1004, the hostages H1121 H8594 also, and returned H7725 (8799) to Samaria H8111.
025:025 And Amaziah H0558 the son H1121 of Joash H3101 king H4428 of Judah H3063 lived H2421 (8799) after H0310 the death H4194 of Joash H3101 son H1121 of Jehoahaz H3059 king H4428 of Israel H3478 fifteen H2568 H6240 years H8141.
025:026 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Amaziah H0558, first H7223 and last H0314, behold, [are] they not written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 and Israel H3478?
025:027 Now after the time H6256 that Amaziah H0558 did turn away H5493 (8804) from following H0310 the LORD H3068 they made H7194 (8799) a conspiracy H7195 against him in Jerusalem H3389; and he fled H5127 (8799) to Lachish H3923: but they sent H7971 (8799) to Lachish H3923 after H0310 him, and slew H4191 (8686) him there.
025:028 And they brought H5375 (8799) him upon horses H5483, and buried H6912 (8799) him with his fathers H0001 in the city H5892 of Judah H3063.
026:001 ¶  Then all the people H5971 of Judah H3063 took H3947 (8799) Uzziah H5818, who [was] sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141 old H1121, and made him king H4427 (8686) in the room of his father H0001 Amaziah H0558.
026:002 He built H1129 (8804) Eloth H0359, and restored H7725 (8686) it to Judah H3063, after H0310 that the king H4428 slept H7901 (8800) with his fathers H0001.
026:003 Sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141 old H1121 [was] Uzziah H5818 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) fifty H2572 and two H8147 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. His mother’s H0517 name H8034 also [was] Jecoliah H3203 of Jerusalem H3389.
026:004 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that his father H0001 Amaziah H0558 did H6213 (8804).
026:005 And he sought H1875 (8800) God H0430 in the days H3117 of Zechariah H2148, who had understanding H0995 (8688) in the visions H7200 (8800) of God H0430: and as long as H3117 he sought H1875 (8800) the LORD H3068, God H0430 made him to prosper H6743 (8689).
026:006 And he went forth H3318 (8799) and warred H3898 (8735) against the Philistines H6430, and brake down H6555 (8799) the wall H2346 of Gath H1661, and the wall H2346 of Jabneh H2996, and the wall H2346 of Ashdod H0795, and built H1129 (8799) cities H5892 about Ashdod H0795, and among the Philistines H6430.
026:007 And God H0430 helped H5826 (8799) him against the Philistines H6430, and against the Arabians H6163 that dwelt H3427 (8802) in Gurbaal H1485, and the Mehunims H4586.
026:008 And the Ammonites H5984 gave H5414 (8799) gifts H4503 to Uzziah H5818: and his name H8034 spread abroad H3212 (8799) [even] to the entering H0935 (8800) in of Egypt H4714; for he strengthened H2388 (8689) [himself] exceedingly H4605.
026:009 Moreover Uzziah H5818 built H1129 (8799) towers H4026 in Jerusalem H3389 at the corner H6438 gate H8179, and at the valley H1516 gate H8179, and at the turning H4740 [of the wall], and fortified H2388 (8762) them.
026:010 Also he built H1129 (8799) towers H4026 in the desert H4057, and digged H2672 (8799) many H7227 wells H0953: for he had much H7227 cattle H4735, both in the low country H8219, and in the plains H4334: husbandmen H0406 [also], and vine dressers H3755 in the mountains H2022, and in Carmel H3760: for he loved H0157 (8802) husbandry H0127.
026:011 Moreover Uzziah H5818 had an host H2428 of fighting H4421 men H6213 (8802), that went out H3318 (8802) to war H6635 by bands H1416, according to the number H4557 of their account H6486 by the hand H3027 of Jeiel H3273 the scribe H5608 (8802) and Maaseiah H4641 the ruler H7860 (8802), under the hand H3027 of Hananiah H2608, [one] of the king’s H4428 captains H8269.
026:012 The whole number H4557 of the chief H7218 of the fathers H0001 of the mighty men H1368 of valour H2428 [were] two thousand H0505 and six H8337 hundred H3967.
026:013 And under their hand H3027 [was] an army H2428 H6635, three H7969 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 and seven H7651 thousand H0505 and five H2568 hundred H3967, that made H6213 (8802) war H4421 with mighty H2428 power H3581, to help H5826 (8800) the king H4428 against the enemy H0341 (8802).
026:014 And Uzziah H5818 prepared H3559 (8686) for them throughout all the host H6635 shields H4043, and spears H7420, and helmets H3553, and habergeons H8302, and bows H7198, and slings H7050 [to cast] stones H0068.
026:015 And he made H6213 (8799) in Jerusalem H3389 engines H2810, invented H4284 by cunning men H2803 (8802), to be on the towers H4026 and upon the bulwarks H6438, to shoot H3384 (8800) arrows H2671 and great H1419 stones H0068 withal. And his name H8034 spread H3318 (8799) far abroad H7350; for he was marvellously H6381 (8689) helped H5826 (8736), till H3588 he was strong H2388 (8804).
026:016 But when he was strong H2393, his heart H3820 was lifted up H1361 (8804) to [his] destruction H7843 (8687): for he transgressed H4603 (8799) against the LORD H3068 his God H0430, and went H0935 (8799) into the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068 to burn incense H6999 (8687) upon the altar H4196 of incense H7004.
026:017 And Azariah H5838 the priest H3548 went in H0935 (8799) after H0310 him, and with him fourscore H8084 priests H3548 of the LORD H3068, [that were] valiant H2428 men H1121:
026:018 And they withstood H5975 (8799) Uzziah H5818 the king H4428, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, [It appertaineth] not unto thee, Uzziah H5818, to burn incense H6999 (8687) unto the LORD H3068, but to the priests H3548 the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175, that are consecrated H6942 (8794) to burn incense H6999 (8687): go out H3318 (8798) of the sanctuary H4720; for thou hast trespassed H4603 (8804); neither [shall it be] for thine honour H3519 from the LORD H3068 God H0430.
026:019 Then Uzziah H5818 was wroth H2196 (8799), and [had] a censer H4730 in his hand H3027 to burn incense H6999 (8687): and while he was wroth H2196 (8800) with the priests H3548, the leprosy H6883 even rose up H2224 (8804) in his forehead H4696 before H6440 the priests H3548 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, from beside the incense H7004 altar H4196.
026:020 And Azariah H5838 the chief H7218 priest H3548, and all the priests H3548, looked H6437 (8799) upon him, and, behold, he [was] leprous H6879 (8794) in his forehead H4696, and they thrust him out H0926 (8686) from thence; yea, himself hasted H1765 (8738) also to go out H3318 (8800), because the LORD H3068 had smitten H5060 (8765) him.
026:021 And Uzziah H5818 the king H4428 was a leper H6879 (8794) unto the day H3117 of his death H4194, and dwelt in H3427 (8799) a several H2669 (8675) H2669 house H1004, [being] a leper H6879 (8794); for he was cut off H1504 (8738) from the house H1004 of the LORD H3068: and Jotham H3147 his son H1121 [was] over the king’s H4428 house H1004, judging H8199 (8802) the people H5971 of the land H0776.
026:022 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Uzziah H5818, first H7223 and last H0314, did Isaiah H3470 the prophet H5030, the son H1121 of Amoz H0531, write H3789 (8804).
026:023 So Uzziah H5818 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and they buried H6912 (8799) him with his fathers H0001 in the field H7704 of the burial H6900 which [belonged] to the kings H4428; for they said H0559 (8804), He [is] a leper H6879 (8794): and Jotham H3147 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
027:001 ¶  Jotham H3147 [was] twenty H6242 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. His mother’s H0517 name H8034 also [was] Jerushah H3388, the daughter H1323 of Zadok H6659.
027:002 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that his father H0001 Uzziah H5818 did H6213 (8804): howbeit he entered H0935 (8804) not into the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068. And the people H5971 did yet corruptly H7843 (8688).
027:003 He built H1129 (8804) the high H5945 gate H8179 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and on the wall H2346 of Ophel H6077 he built H1129 (8804) much H7230.
027:004 Moreover he built H1129 (8804) cities H5892 in the mountains H2022 of Judah H3063, and in the forests H2793 he built H1129 (8804) castles H1003 and towers H4026.
027:005 He fought H3898 (8738) also with the king H4428 of the Ammonites H5984, and prevailed H2388 (8799) against them. And the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 gave H5414 (8799) him the same year H8141 an hundred H3967 talents H3603 of silver H3701, and ten H6235 thousand H0505 measures H3734 of wheat H2406, and ten H6235 thousand H0505 of barley H8184. So much did the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 pay H7725 (8689) unto H2063 him, both the second H8145 year H8141, and the third H7992.
027:006 So Jotham H3147 became mighty H2388 (8691), because he prepared H3559 (8689) his ways H1870 before H6440 the LORD H3068 his God H0430.
027:007 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Jotham H3147, and all his wars H4421, and his ways H1870, lo, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478 and Judah H3063.
027:008 He was five H2568 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and reigned H4427 (8804) sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389.
027:009 And Jotham H3147 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and they buried H6912 (8799) him in the city H5892 of David H1732: and Ahaz H0271 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
028:001 ¶  Ahaz H0271 [was] twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) sixteen H8337 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389: but he did H6213 (8804) not [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, like David H1732 his father H0001:
028:002 For he walked in H3212 (8799) the ways H1870 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478, and made H6213 (8804) also molten images H4541 for Baalim H1168.
028:003 Moreover he burnt incense H6999 (8689) in the valley H1516 of the son H1121 of Hinnom H2011, and burnt H1197 (8686) his children H1121 in the fire H0784, after the abominations H8441 of the heathen H1471 whom the LORD H3068 had cast out H3423 (8689) before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
028:004 He sacrificed H2076 (8762) also and burnt incense H6999 (8762) in the high places H1116, and on the hills H1389, and under every green H7488 tree H6086.
028:005 Wherefore the LORD H3068 his God H0430 delivered H5414 (8799) him into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Syria H0758; and they smote H5221 (8686) him, and carried away H7617 (8799) a great multitude H1419 of them captives H7633, and brought H0935 (8686) [them] to Damascus H1834. And he was also delivered H5414 (8737) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Israel H3478, who smote H5221 (8686) him with a great H1419 slaughter H4347.
028:006 For Pekah H6492 the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425 slew H2026 (8799) in Judah H3063 an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 in one H0259 day H3117, [which were] all valiant H2428 men H1121; because they had forsaken H5800 (8800) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001.
028:007 And Zichri H2147, a mighty man H1368 of Ephraim H0669, slew H2026 (8799) Maaseiah H4641 the king’s H4428 son H1121, and Azrikam H5840 the governor H5057 of the house H1004, and Elkanah H0511 [that was] next H4932 to the king H4428.
028:008 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 carried away captive H7617 (8799) of their brethren H0251 two hundred H3967 thousand H0505, women H0802, sons H1121, and daughters H1323, and took also away H0962 (8804) much H7227 spoil H7998 from them, and brought H0935 (8686) the spoil H7998 to Samaria H8111.
028:009 But a prophet H5030 of the LORD H3068 was there, whose name H8034 [was] Oded H5752: and he went out H3318 (8799) before H6440 the host H6635 that came H0935 (8802) to Samaria H8111, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Behold, because the LORD H3068 God H0430 of your fathers H0001 was wroth H2534 with Judah H3063, he hath delivered H5414 (8804) them into your hand H3027, and ye have slain H2026 (8799) them in a rage H2197 [that] reacheth up H5060 (8689) unto heaven H8064.
028:010 And now ye purpose H0559 (8802) to keep under H3533 (8800) the children H1121 of Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389 for bondmen H5650 and bondwomen H8198 unto you: [but are there] not with you, even H7535 with you, sins H0819 against the LORD H3068 your God H0430?
028:011 Now hear H8085 (8798) me therefore, and deliver H7725 (8685) the captives H7633 again, which ye have taken captive H7617 (8804) of your brethren H0251: for the fierce H2740 wrath H0639 of the LORD H3068 [is] upon you.
028:012 Then certain H0582 of the heads H7218 of the children H1121 of Ephraim H0669, Azariah H5838 the son H1121 of Johanan H3076, Berechiah H1296 the son H1121 of Meshillemoth H4919, and Jehizkiah H3169 the son H1121 of Shallum H7967, and Amasa H6021 the son H1121 of Hadlai H2311, stood up H6965 (8799) against them that came H0935 (8802) from the war H6635,
028:013 And said H0559 (8799) unto them, Ye shall not bring in H0935 (8686) the captives H7633 hither: for whereas we have offended H0819 against the LORD H3068 [already], ye intend H0559 (8802) to add H3254 (8687) [more] to our sins H2403 and to our trespass H0819: for our trespass H0819 is great H7227, and [there is] fierce H2740 wrath H0639 against Israel H3478.
028:014 So the armed men H2502 (8803) left H5800 (8799) the captives H7633 and the spoil H0961 before H6440 the princes H8269 and all the congregation H6951.
028:015 And the men H0582 which were expressed H5344 (8738) by name H8034 rose up H6965 (8799), and took H2388 (8686) the captives H7633, and with the spoil H7998 clothed H3847 (8689) all that were naked H4636 among them, and arrayed H3847 (8686) them, and shod H5274 (8686) them, and gave them to eat H0398 (8686) and to drink H8248 (8686), and anointed H5480 (8799) them, and carried H5095 (8762) all the feeble H3782 (8802) of them upon asses H2543, and brought H0935 (8686) them to Jericho H3405, the city H5892 of palm trees H8558 (8677) H5899, to H0681 their brethren H0251: then they returned H7725 (8799) to Samaria H8111.
028:016 At that time H6256 did king H4428 Ahaz H0271 send H7971 (8804) unto the kings H4428 of Assyria H0804 to help H5826 (8800) him.
028:017 For again the Edomites H0130 had come H0935 (8804) and smitten H5221 (8686) Judah H3063, and carried away H7617 (8799) captives H7628.
028:018 The Philistines H6430 also had invaded H6584 (8804) the cities H5892 of the low country H8219, and of the south H5045 of Judah H3063, and had taken H3920 (8799) Bethshemesh H1053, and Ajalon H0357, and Gederoth H1450, and Shocho H7755 with the villages H1323 thereof, and Timnah H8553 with the villages H1323 thereof, Gimzo H1579 also and the villages H1323 thereof: and they dwelt H3427 (8799) there.
028:019 For the LORD H3068 brought H3665 Judah H3063 low H3665 (8689) because of Ahaz H0271 king H4428 of Israel H3478; for he made H6544 Judah H3063 naked H6544 (8689), and transgressed H4603 (8800) sore H4604 against the LORD H3068.
028:020 And Tilgathpilneser H8407 king H4428 of Assyria H0804 came H0935 (8799) unto him, and distressed H6696 (8799) him, but strengthened H2388 (8804) him not.
028:021 For Ahaz H0271 took away a portion H2505 (8804) [out] of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and [out] of the house H1004 of the king H4428, and of the princes H8269, and gave H5414 (8799) [it] unto the king H4428 of Assyria H0804: but he helped H5833 him not.
028:022 And in the time H6256 of his distress H6887 (8687) did he trespass H4603 (8800) yet more H3254 (8686) against the LORD H3068: this [is that] king H4428 Ahaz H0271.
028:023 For he sacrificed H2076 (8799) unto the gods H0430 of Damascus H1834, which smote H5221 (8688) him: and he said H0559 (8799), Because the gods H0430 of the kings H4428 of Syria H0758 help H5826 (8688) them, [therefore] will I sacrifice H2076 (8762) to them, that they may help H5826 (8799) me. But they were the ruin H3782 (8687) of him, and of all Israel H3478.
028:024 And Ahaz H0271 gathered together H0622 (8799) the vessels H3627 of the house H1004 of God H0430, and cut in pieces H7112 (8762) the vessels H3627 of the house H1004 of God H0430, and shut up H5462 (8799) the doors H1817 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and he made H6213 (8799) him altars H4196 in every corner H6438 of Jerusalem H3389.
028:025 And in every several city H5892 of Judah H3063 he made H6213 (8804) high places H1116 to burn incense H6999 (8763) unto other H0312 gods H0430, and provoked to anger H3707 (8686) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of his fathers H0001.
028:026 Now the rest H3499 of his acts H1697 and of all his ways H1870, first H7223 and last H0314, behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 and Israel H3478.
028:027 And Ahaz H0271 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and they buried H6912 (8799) him in the city H5892, [even] in Jerusalem H3389: but they brought H0935 (8689) him not into the sepulchres H6913 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478: and Hezekiah H3169 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
029:001 ¶  Hezekiah H3169 began to reign H4427 (8804) [when he was] five H2568 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121, and he reigned H4427 (8804) nine H8672 and twenty H6242 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389. And his mother’s H0517 name H8034 [was] Abijah H0029, the daughter H1323 of Zechariah H2148.
029:002 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, according to all that David H1732 his father H0001 had done H6213 (8804).
029:003 He in the first H7223 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800), in the first H7223 month H2320, opened H6605 (8804) the doors H1817 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and repaired H2388 (8762) them.
029:004 And he brought in H0935 (8686) the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881, and gathered them together H0622 (8799) into the east H4217 street H7339,
029:005 And said H0559 (8799) unto them, Hear H8085 (8798) me, ye Levites H3881, sanctify H6942 (8690) now yourselves, and sanctify H6942 (8761) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of your fathers H0001, and carry forth H3318 (8685) the filthiness H5079 out of the holy H6944 [place].
029:006 For our fathers H0001 have trespassed H4603 (8804), and done H6213 (8804) [that which was] evil H7451 in the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430, and have forsaken H5800 (8799) him, and have turned away H5437 (8686) their faces H6440 from the habitation H4908 of the LORD H3068, and turned H5414 (8799) [their] backs H6203.
029:007 Also they have shut up H5462 (8804) the doors H1817 of the porch H0197, and put out H3518 (8762) the lamps H5216, and have not burned H6999 (8689) incense H7004 nor offered H5927 (8689) burnt offerings H5930 in the holy H6944 [place] unto the God H0430 of Israel H3478.
029:008 Wherefore the wrath H7110 of the LORD H3068 was upon Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, and he hath delivered H5414 (8799) them to trouble H2189 (8675) H2113, to astonishment H8047, and to hissing H8322, as ye see H7200 (8802) with your eyes H5869.
029:009 For, lo, our fathers H0001 have fallen H5307 (8804) by the sword H2719, and our sons H1121 and our daughters H1323 and our wives H0802 [are] in captivity H7628 for this.
029:010 Now [it is] in mine heart H3824 to make H3772 (8800) a covenant H1285 with the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, that his fierce H2740 wrath H0639 may turn away H7725 (8799) from us.
029:011 My sons H1121, be not now negligent H7952 (8735): for the LORD H3068 hath chosen H0977 (8804) you to stand H5975 (8800) before H6440 him, to serve H8334 (8763) him, and that ye should minister H8334 (8764) unto him, and burn incense H6999 (8688).
029:012 Then the Levites H3881 arose H6965 (8799), Mahath H4287 the son H1121 of Amasai H6022, and Joel H3100 the son H1121 of Azariah H5838, of the sons H1121 of the Kohathites H6956: and of the sons H1121 of Merari H4847, Kish H7027 the son H1121 of Abdi H5660, and Azariah H5838 the son H1121 of Jehalelel H3094: and of the Gershonites H1649; Joah H3098 the son H1121 of Zimmah H2155, and Eden H5731 the son H1121 of Joah H3098:
029:013 And of the sons H1121 of Elizaphan H0469; Shimri H8113, and Jeiel H3273: and of the sons H1121 of Asaph H0623; Zechariah H2148, and Mattaniah H4983:
029:014 And of the sons H1121 of Heman H1968; Jehiel H3171, and Shimei H8096: and of the sons H1121 of Jeduthun H3038; Shemaiah H8098, and Uzziel H5816.
029:015 And they gathered H0622 (8799) their brethren H0251, and sanctified H6942 (8691) themselves, and came H0935 (8799), according to the commandment H4687 of the king H4428, by the words H1697 of the LORD H3068, to cleanse H2891 (8763) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
029:016 And the priests H3548 went H0935 (8799) into the inner part H6441 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, to cleanse H2891 (8763) [it], and brought out H3318 (8686) all the uncleanness H2932 that they found H4672 (8804) in the temple H1964 of the LORD H3068 into the court H2691 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068. And the Levites H3881 took H6901 (8762) [it], to carry [it] out H3318 (8687) abroad H2351 into the brook H5158 Kidron H6939.
029:017 Now they began H2490 (8686) on the first H0259 [day] of the first H7223 month H2320 to sanctify H6942 (8763), and on the eighth H8083 day H3117 of the month H2320 came H0935 (8804) they to the porch H0197 of the LORD H3068: so they sanctified H6942 (8762) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 in eight H8083 days H3117; and in the sixteenth H8337 H6240 day of the first H7223 month H2320 they made an end H3615 (8765).
029:018 Then they went H0935 (8799) in H6441 to Hezekiah H2396 the king H4428, and said H0559 (8799), We have cleansed H2891 (8765) all the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and the altar H4196 of burnt offering H5930, with all the vessels H3627 thereof, and the shewbread H4635 table H7979, with all the vessels H3627 thereof.
029:019 Moreover all the vessels H3627, which king H4428 Ahaz H0271 in his reign H4438 did cast away H2186 (8689) in his transgression H4604, have we prepared H3559 (8689) and sanctified H6942 (8689), and, behold, they [are] before H6440 the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068.
029:020 Then Hezekiah H3169 the king H4428 rose early H7925 (8686), and gathered H0622 (8799) the rulers H8269 of the city H5892, and went up H5927 (8799) to the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
029:021 And they brought H0935 (8686) seven H7651 bullocks H6499, and seven H7651 rams H0352, and seven H7651 lambs H3532, and seven H7651 he H6842 goats H5795, for a sin offering H2403 for the kingdom H4467, and for the sanctuary H4720, and for Judah H3063. And he commanded H0559 (8799) the priests H3548 the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 to offer H5927 (8687) [them] on the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068.
029:022 So they killed H7819 (8799) the bullocks H1241, and the priests H3548 received H6901 (8762) the blood H1818, and sprinkled H2236 (8799) [it] on the altar H4196: likewise, when they had killed H7819 (8799) the rams H0352, they sprinkled H2236 (8799) the blood H1818 upon the altar H4196: they killed H7819 (8799) also the lambs H3532, and they sprinkled H2236 (8799) the blood H1818 upon the altar H4196.
029:023 And they brought forth H5066 (8686) the he goats H8163 [for] the sin offering H2403 before H6440 the king H4428 and the congregation H6951; and they laid H5564 (8799) their hands H3027 upon them:
029:024 And the priests H3548 killed H7819 (8799) them, and they made reconciliation H2398 (8762) with their blood H1818 upon the altar H4196, to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for all Israel H3478: for the king H4428 commanded H0559 (8804) [that] the burnt offering H5930 and the sin offering H2403 [should be made] for all Israel H3478.
029:025 And he set H5975 (8686) the Levites H3881 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 with cymbals H4700, with psalteries H5035, and with harps H3658, according to the commandment H4687 of David H1732, and of Gad H1410 the king’s H4428 seer H2374, and Nathan H5416 the prophet H5030: for [so was] the commandment H4687 of H3027 the LORD H3068 by H3027 his prophets H5030.
029:026 And the Levites H3881 stood H5975 (8799) with the instruments H3627 of David H1732, and the priests H3548 with the trumpets H2689.
029:027 And Hezekiah H2396 commanded H0559 (8799) to offer H5927 (8687) the burnt offering H5930 upon the altar H4196. And when H6256 the burnt offering H5930 began H2490 (8689), the song H7892 of the LORD H3068 began H2490 (8689) [also] with the trumpets H2689, and with the instruments H3627 [ordained] by H3027 David H1732 king H4428 of Israel H3478.
029:028 And all the congregation H6951 worshipped H7812 (8693), and the singers H7892 sang H7891 (8789), and the trumpeters H2689 sounded H2690 (8688) (8675) H2690 (8764): [and] all [this continued] until the burnt offering H5930 was finished H3615 (8800).
029:029 And when they had made an end H3615 (8763) of offering H5927 (8687), the king H4428 and all that were present H4672 (8737) with him bowed H3766 (8804) themselves, and worshipped H7812 (8691).
029:030 Moreover Hezekiah H3169 the king H4428 and the princes H8269 commanded H0559 (8799) the Levites H3881 to sing praise H1984 (8763) unto the LORD H3068 with the words H1697 of David H1732, and of Asaph H0623 the seer H2374. And they sang praises H1984 (8762) with gladness H8057, and they bowed their heads H6915 (8799) and worshipped H7812 (8691).
029:031 Then Hezekiah H3169 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Now ye have consecrated H4390 (8765) H3027 yourselves unto the LORD H3068, come near H5066 (8798) and bring H0935 (8685) sacrifices H2077 and thank offerings H8426 into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068. And the congregation H6951 brought in H0935 (8686) sacrifices H2077 and thank offerings H8426; and as many as were of a free H5081 heart H3820 burnt offerings H5930.
029:032 And the number H4557 of the burnt offerings H5930, which the congregation H6951 brought H0935 (8689), was threescore and ten H7657 bullocks H1241, an hundred H3967 rams H0352, [and] two hundred H3967 lambs H3532: all these [were] for a burnt offering H5930 to the LORD H3068.
029:033 And the consecrated things H6944 [were] six H8337 hundred H3967 oxen H1241 and three H7969 thousand H0505 sheep H6629.
029:034 But the priests H3548 were too few H4592, so that they could H3201 (8804) not flay H6584 (8687) all the burnt offerings H5930: wherefore their brethren H0251 the Levites H3881 did help H2388 (8762) them, till the work H4399 was ended H3615 (8800), and until the [other] priests H3548 had sanctified H6942 (8691) themselves: for the Levites H3881 [were] more upright H3477 in heart H3824 to sanctify H6942 (8692) themselves than the priests H3548.
029:035 And also the burnt offerings H5930 [were] in abundance H7230, with the fat H2459 of the peace offerings H8002, and the drink offerings H5262 for [every] burnt offering H5930. So the service H5656 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 was set in order H3559 (8735).
029:036 And Hezekiah H3169 rejoiced H8055 (8799), and all the people H5971, that God H0430 had prepared H3559 (8689) the people H5971: for the thing H1697 was [done] suddenly H6597.
030:001 ¶  And Hezekiah H3169 sent H7971 (8799) to all Israel H3478 and Judah H3063, and wrote H3789 (8804) letters H0107 also to Ephraim H0669 and Manasseh H4519, that they should come H0935 (8800) to the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 at Jerusalem H3389, to keep H6213 (8800) the passover H6453 unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
030:002 For the king H4428 had taken counsel H3289 (8735), and his princes H8269, and all the congregation H6951 in Jerusalem H3389, to keep H6213 (8800) the passover H6453 in the second H8145 month H2320.
030:003 For they could H3201 (8804) not keep H6213 (8800) it at that time H6256, because the priests H3548 had not sanctified H6942 (8694) themselves sufficiently H4078 (8676) H1767, neither had the people H5971 gathered themselves together H0622 (8738) to Jerusalem H3389.
030:004 And the thing H1697 pleased H3474 (8799) H5869 the king H4428 and all the congregation H6951.
030:005 So they established H5975 (8686) a decree H1697 to make proclamation H5674 (8687) H6963 throughout all Israel H3478, from Beersheba H0884 even to Dan H1835, that they should come H0935 (8800) to keep H6213 (8800) the passover H6453 unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 at Jerusalem H3389: for they had not done H6213 (8804) [it] of a long H7230 [time in such sort] as it was written H3789 (8803).
030:006 So the posts H7323 (8801) went H3212 (8799) with the letters H0107 from H3027 the king H4428 and his princes H8269 throughout all Israel H3478 and Judah H3063, and according to the commandment H4687 of the king H4428, saying H0559 (8800), Ye children H1121 of Israel H3478, turn again H7725 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Abraham H0085, Isaac H3327, and Israel H3478, and he will return H7725 (8799) to the remnant H7604 (8737) of you, that are escaped H6413 out of the hand H3709 of the kings H4428 of Assyria H0804.
030:007 And be not ye like your fathers H0001, and like your brethren H0251, which trespassed H4603 (8804) against the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001, [who] therefore gave them up H5414 (8799) to desolation H8047, as ye see H7200 (8802).
030:008 Now be ye not stiffnecked H7185 (8686) H6203, as your fathers H0001 [were, but] yield H5414 (8798) yourselves H3027 unto the LORD H3068, and enter H0935 (8798) into his sanctuary H4720, which he hath sanctified H6942 (8689) for ever H5769: and serve H5647 (8798) the LORD H3068 your God H0430, that the fierceness H2740 of his wrath H0639 may turn away H7725 (8799) from you.
030:009 For if ye turn again H7725 (8800) unto the LORD H3068, your brethren H0251 and your children H1121 [shall find] compassion H7356 before H6440 them that lead them captive H7617 (8802), so that they shall come again H7725 (8800) into this land H0776: for the LORD H3068 your God H0430 [is] gracious H2587 and merciful H7349, and will not turn away H5493 (8686) [his] face H6440 from you, if ye return H7725 (8799) unto him.
030:010 So the posts H7323 (8801) passed H5674 (8802) from city H5892 to city H5892 through the country H0776 of Ephraim H0669 and Manasseh H4519 even unto Zebulun H2074: but they laughed them to scorn H7832 (8688), and mocked H3932 (8688) them.
030:011 Nevertheless divers H0582 of Asher H0836 and Manasseh H4519 and of Zebulun H2074 humbled H3665 (8738) themselves, and came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
030:012 Also in Judah H3063 the hand H3027 of God H0430 was to give H5414 (8800) them one H0259 heart H3820 to do H6213 (8800) the commandment H4687 of the king H4428 and of the princes H8269, by the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
030:013 And there assembled H0622 (8735) at Jerusalem H3389 much H7227 people H5971 to keep H6213 (8800) the feast H2282 of unleavened bread H4682 in the second H8145 month H2320, a very H3966 great H7230 congregation H6951.
030:014 And they arose H6965 (8799) and took away H5493 (8686) the altars H4196 that [were] in Jerusalem H3389, and all the altars for incense H6999 took they away H5493 (8689), and cast H7993 (8686) [them] into the brook H5158 Kidron H6939.
030:015 Then they killed H7819 (8799) the passover H6453 on the fourteenth H0702 H6240 [day] of the second H8145 month H2320: and the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881 were ashamed H3637 (8738), and sanctified H6942 (8691) themselves, and brought in H0935 (8686) the burnt offerings H5930 into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
030:016 And they stood H5975 (8799) in their place H5977 after their manner H4941, according to the law H8451 of Moses H4872 the man H0376 of God H0430: the priests H3548 sprinkled H2236 (8802) the blood H1818, [which they received] of the hand H3027 of the Levites H3881.
030:017 For [there were] many H7227 in the congregation H6951 that were not sanctified H6942 (8694): therefore the Levites H3881 had the charge of the killing H7821 of the passovers H6453 for every one [that was] not clean H2889, to sanctify H6942 (8687) [them] unto the LORD H3068.
030:018 For a multitude H4768 of the people H5971, [even] many H7227 of Ephraim H0669, and Manasseh H4519, Issachar H3485, and Zebulun H2074, had not H3808 cleansed H2891 (8694) themselves, yet did they eat H0398 (8804) the passover H6453 otherwise than it was written H3789 (8803). But Hezekiah H3169 prayed H6419 (8694) for them, saying H0559 (8800), The good H2896 LORD H3068 pardon H3722 (8762) every one
030:019 [That] prepareth H3559 (8689) his heart H3824 to seek H1875 (8800) God H0430, the LORD H3068 God H0430 of his fathers H0001, though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification H2893 of the sanctuary H6944.
030:020 And the LORD H3068 hearkened H8085 (8799) to Hezekiah H3169, and healed H7495 (8799) the people H5971.
030:021 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 that were present H4672 (8737) at Jerusalem H3389 kept H6213 (8799) the feast H2282 of unleavened bread H4682 seven H7651 days H3117 with great H1419 gladness H8057: and the Levites H3881 and the priests H3548 praised H1984 (8764) the LORD H3068 day H3117 by day H3117, [singing] with loud H5797 instruments H3627 unto the LORD H3068.
030:022 And Hezekiah H3169 spake H1696 (8762) comfortably H3820 unto all the Levites H3881 that taught H7919 (8688) the good H2896 knowledge H7922 of the LORD H3068: and they did eat H0398 (8799) throughout the feast H4150 seven H7651 days H3117, offering H2076 (8764) peace H8002 offerings H2077, and making confession H3034 (8693) to the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001.
030:023 And the whole assembly H6951 took counsel H3289 (8735) to keep H6213 (8800) other H0312 seven H7651 days H3117: and they kept H6213 (8799) [other] seven H7651 days H3117 with gladness H8057.
030:024 For Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063 did give H7311 (8689) to the congregation H6951 a thousand H0505 bullocks H6499 and seven H7651 thousand H0505 sheep H6629; and the princes H8269 gave H7311 (8689) to the congregation H6951 a thousand H0505 bullocks H6499 and ten H6235 thousand H0505 sheep H6629: and a great number H7230 of priests H3548 sanctified H6942 (8691) themselves.
030:025 And all the congregation H6951 of Judah H3063, with the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881, and all the congregation H6951 that came out H0935 (8802) of Israel H3478, and the strangers H1616 that came out H0935 (8802) of the land H0776 of Israel H3478, and that dwelt H3427 (8802) in Judah H3063, rejoiced H8055 (8799).
030:026 So there was great H1419 joy H8057 in Jerusalem H3389: for since the time H3117 of Solomon H8010 the son H1121 of David H1732 king H4428 of Israel H3478 [there was] not the like in Jerusalem H3389.
030:027 Then the priests H3548 the Levites H3881 arose H6965 (8799) and blessed H1288 (8762) the people H5971: and their voice H6963 was heard H8085 (8735), and their prayer H8605 came H0935 (8799) [up] to his holy H6944 dwelling place H4583, [even] unto heaven H8064.
031:001 ¶  Now when all this was finished H3615 (8763), all Israel H3478 that were present H4672 (8737) went out H3318 (8804) to the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and brake H7665 the images H4676 in pieces H7665 (8762), and cut down H1438 (8762) the groves H0842, and threw down H5422 (8762) the high places H1116 and the altars H4196 out of all Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144, in Ephraim H0669 also and Manasseh H4519, until they had utterly destroyed H3615 (8763) them all. Then all the children H1121 of Israel H3478 returned H7725 (8799), every man H0376 to his possession H0272, into their own cities H5892.
031:002 And Hezekiah H3169 appointed H5975 (8686) the courses H4256 of the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881 after their courses H4256, every man H0376 according H6310 to his service H5656, the priests H3548 and Levites H3881 for burnt offerings H5930 and for peace offerings H8002, to minister H8334 (8763), and to give thanks H3034 (8687), and to praise H1984 (8763) in the gates H8179 of the tents H4264 of the LORD H3068.
031:003 [He appointed] also the king’s H4428 portion H4521 of his substance H7399 for the burnt offerings H5930, [to wit], for the morning H1242 and evening H6153 burnt offerings H5930, and the burnt offerings H5930 for the sabbaths H7676, and for the new moons H2320, and for the set feasts H4150, as [it is] written H3789 (8803) in the law H8451 of the LORD H3068.
031:004 Moreover he commanded H0559 (8799) the people H5971 that dwelt H3427 (8802) in Jerusalem H3389 to give H5414 (8800) the portion H4521 of the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881, that they might be encouraged H2388 (8799) in the law H8451 of the LORD H3068.
031:005 And as soon as the commandment H1697 came abroad H6555 (8800), the children H1121 of Israel H3478 brought H0935 (8689) in abundance H7235 (8689) the firstfruits H7225 of corn H1715, wine H8492, and oil H3323, and honey H1706, and of all the increase H8393 of the field H7704; and the tithe H4643 of all [things] brought H0935 (8689) they in abundantly H7230.
031:006 And [concerning] the children H1121 of Israel H3478 and Judah H3063, that dwelt H3427 (8802) in the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, they also brought in H0935 (8689) the tithe H4643 of oxen H1241 and sheep H6629, and the tithe H4643 of holy things H6944 which were consecrated H6942 (8794) unto the LORD H3068 their God H0430, and laid H5414 (8799) [them] by heaps H6194 H6194.
031:007 In the third H7992 month H2320 they began H2490 (8689) to lay the foundation H3245 (8800) of the heaps H6194, and finished H3615 (8765) [them] in the seventh H7637 month H2320.
031:008 And when Hezekiah H3169 and the princes H8269 came H0935 (8799) and saw H7200 (8799) the heaps H6194, they blessed H1288 (8762) the LORD H3068, and his people H5971 Israel H3478.
031:009 Then Hezekiah H3169 questioned H1875 (8799) with the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881 concerning the heaps H6194.
031:010 And Azariah H5838 the chief H7218 priest H3548 of the house H1004 of Zadok H6659 answered H0559 (8799) him, and said H0559 (8799), Since [the people] began H2490 (8687) to bring H0935 (8687) the offerings H8641 into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, we have had enough H7646 (8800) to eat H0398 (8800), and have left H3498 (8687) plenty H7230: for the LORD H3068 hath blessed H1288 (8765) his people H5971; and that which is left H3498 (8737) [is] this great store H1995.
031:011 Then Hezekiah H3169 commanded H0559 (8799) to prepare H3559 (8687) chambers H3957 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068; and they prepared H3559 (8686) [them],
031:012 And brought in H0935 (8686) the offerings H8641 and the tithes H4643 and the dedicated H6944 [things] faithfully H0530: over which Cononiah H3562 the Levite H3881 [was] ruler H5057, and Shimei H8096 his brother H0251 [was] the next H4932.
031:013 And Jehiel H3171, and Azaziah H5812, and Nahath H5184, and Asahel H6214, and Jerimoth H3406, and Jozabad H3107, and Eliel H0447, and Ismachiah H3253, and Mahath H4287, and Benaiah H1141, [were] overseers H6496 under the hand H3027 of Cononiah H3562 and Shimei H8096 his brother H0251, at the commandment H4662 of Hezekiah H3169 the king H4428, and Azariah H5838 the ruler H5057 of the house H1004 of God H0430.
031:014 And Kore H6981 the son H1121 of Imnah H3232 the Levite H3881, the porter H7778 toward the east H4217, [was] over the freewill offerings H5071 of God H0430, to distribute H5414 (8800) the oblations H8641 of the LORD H3068, and the most H6944 holy things H6944.
031:015 And next him [were] Eden H5731, and Miniamin H4509, and Jeshua H3442, and Shemaiah H8098, Amariah H0568, and Shecaniah H7935, in the cities H5892 of the priests H3548, in [their] set office H0530, to give H5414 (8800) to their brethren H0251 by H3027 courses H4256, as well to the great H1419 as to the small H6996:
031:016 Beside their genealogy H3187 (8692) of males H2145, from three H7969 years H8141 old H1121 and upward H4605, [even] unto every one that entereth H0935 (8802) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, his daily H3117 H3117 portion H1697 for their service H5656 in their charges H4931 according to their courses H4256;
031:017 Both to the genealogy H3187 (8692) of the priests H3548 by the house H1004 of their fathers H0001, and the Levites H3881 from twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 and upward H4605, in their charges H4931 by their courses H4256;
031:018 And to the genealogy H3187 (8692) of all their little ones H2945, their wives H0802, and their sons H1121, and their daughters H1323, through all the congregation H6951: for in their set office H0530 they sanctified H6942 (8691) themselves in holiness H6944:
031:019 Also of the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 the priests H3548, [which were] in the fields H7704 of the suburbs H4054 of their cities H5892, in every several city H5892, the men H0582 that were expressed H5344 (8738) by name H8034, to give H5414 (8800) portions H4490 to all the males H2145 among the priests H3548, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies H3187 (8692) among the Levites H3881.
031:020 And thus did H6213 (8799) Hezekiah H3169 throughout all Judah H3063, and wrought H6213 (8799) [that which was] good H2896 and right H3477 and truth H0571 before H6440 the LORD H3068 his God H0430.
031:021 And in every work H4639 that he began H2490 (8689) in the service H5656 of the house H1004 of God H0430, and in the law H8451, and in the commandments H4687, to seek H1875 (8800) his God H0430, he did H6213 (8804) [it] with all his heart H3824, and prospered H6743 (8689).
032:001 ¶  After H0310 these things H1697, and the establishment H0571 thereof, Sennacherib H5576 king H4428 of Assyria H0804 came H0935 (8804), and entered H0935 (8799) into Judah H3063, and encamped H2583 (8799) against the fenced H1219 (8803) cities H5892, and thought H0559 (8799) to win H1234 (8800) them for himself.
032:002 And when Hezekiah H3169 saw H7200 (8799) that Sennacherib H5576 was come H0935 (8804), and that he was purposed H6440 to fight H4421 against Jerusalem H3389,
032:003 He took counsel H3289 (8735) with his princes H8269 and his mighty men H1368 to stop H5640 (8800) the waters H4325 of the fountains H5869 which [were] without H2351 the city H5892: and they did help H5826 (8799) him.
032:004 So there was gathered H6908 much H7227 people H5971 together H6908 (8735), who stopped H5640 (8799) all the fountains H4599, and the brook H5158 that ran H7857 (8802) through the midst H8432 of the land H0776, saying H0559 (8800), Why should the kings H4428 of Assyria H0804 come H0935 (8799), and find H4672 (8804) much H7227 water H4325?
032:005 Also he strengthened H2388 (8691) himself, and built up H1129 (8799) all the wall H2346 that was broken H6555 (8803), and raised [it] up H5927 (8686) to the towers H4026, and another H0312 wall H2346 without H2351, and repaired H2388 (8762) Millo H4407 [in] the city H5892 of David H1732, and made H6213 (8799) darts H7973 and shields H4043 in abundance H7230.
032:006 And he set H5414 (8799) captains H8269 of war H4421 over the people H5971, and gathered them together H6908 (8799) to him in the street H7339 of the gate H8179 of the city H5892, and spake H1696 (8762) comfortably H3824 to them, saying H0559 (8800),
032:007 Be strong H2388 (8798) and courageous H0553 (8798), be not afraid H3372 (8799) nor dismayed H2865 (8735) for H6440 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, nor for all the multitude H1995 that [is] with him: for [there be] more H7227 with us than with him:
032:008 With him [is] an arm H2220 of flesh H1320; but with us [is] the LORD H3068 our God H0430 to help H5826 (8800) us, and to fight H3898 (8736) our battles H4421. And the people H5971 rested H5564 (8735) themselves upon the words H1697 of Hezekiah H3169 king H4428 of Judah H3063.
032:009 After H0310 this did Sennacherib H5576 king H4428 of Assyria H0804 send H7971 (8804) his servants H5650 to Jerusalem H3389, (but he [himself laid siege] against Lachish H3923, and all his power H4475 with him,) unto Hezekiah H3169 king H4428 of Judah H3063, and unto all Judah H3063 that [were] at Jerusalem H3389, saying H0559 (8800),
032:010 Thus saith H0559 (8804) Sennacherib H5576 king H4428 of Assyria H0804, Whereon do ye trust H0982 (8802), that ye abide H3427 (8802) in the siege H4692 in Jerusalem H3389?
032:011 Doth not Hezekiah H3169 persuade H5496 (8688) you to give H5414 (8800) over yourselves to die H4191 (8800) by famine H7458 and by thirst H6772, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 our God H0430 shall deliver H5337 (8686) us out of the hand H3709 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804?
032:012 Hath not the same Hezekiah H3169 taken away H5493 (8689) his high places H1116 and his altars H4196, and commanded H0559 (8799) Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, saying H0559 (8800), Ye shall worship H7812 (8691) before H6440 one H0259 altar H4196, and burn incense H6999 (8686) upon it?
032:013 Know H3045 (8799) ye not what I and my fathers H0001 have done H6213 (8804) unto all the people H5971 of [other] lands H0776? were the gods H0430 of the nations H1471 of those lands H0776 any ways H3201 (8800) able H3201 (8804) to deliver H5337 (8687) their lands H0776 out of mine hand H3027?
032:014 Who [was there] among all the gods H0430 of those nations H1471 that my fathers H0001 utterly destroyed H2763 (8689), that could H3201 (8804) deliver H5337 (8687) his people H5971 out of mine hand H3027, that your God H0430 should be able H3201 (8799) to deliver H5337 (8687) you out of mine hand H3027?
032:015 Now therefore let not H3808 Hezekiah H2396 deceive H5377 (8686) you, nor persuade H5496 (8686) you on this manner, neither yet believe H0539 (8686) him: for no god H0433 of any nation H1471 or kingdom H4467 was able H3201 (8799) to deliver H5337 (8687) his people H5971 out of mine hand H3027, and out of the hand H3027 of my fathers H0001: how much less shall your God H0430 deliver H5337 (8686) you out of mine hand H3027?
032:016 And his servants H5650 spake H1696 (8765) yet [more] against the LORD H3068 God H0430, and against his servant H5650 Hezekiah H3169.
032:017 He wrote H3789 (8804) also letters H5612 to rail H2778 (8763) on the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, and to speak H0559 (8800) against him, saying H0559 (8800), As the gods H0430 of the nations H1471 of [other] lands H0776 have not delivered H5337 (8689) their people H5971 out of mine hand H3027, so shall not the God H0430 of Hezekiah H3169 deliver H5337 (8686) his people H5971 out of mine hand H3027.
032:018 Then they cried H7121 (8799) with a loud H1419 voice H6963 in the Jews’ speech H3066 unto the people H5971 of Jerusalem H3389 that [were] on the wall H2346, to affright H3372 (8763) them, and to trouble H0926 (8763) them; that they might take H3920 (8799) the city H5892.
032:019 And they spake H1696 (8762) against H5921 the God H0430 of Jerusalem H3389, as against the gods H0430 of the people H5971 of the earth H0776, [which were] the work H4639 of the hands H3027 of man H0120.
032:020 And for this [cause] Hezekiah H3169 the king H4428, and the prophet H5030 Isaiah H3470 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531, prayed H6419 (8691) and cried H2199 (8799) to heaven H8064.
032:021 And the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8799) an angel H4397, which cut off H3582 (8686) all the mighty men H1368 of valour H2428, and the leaders H5057 and captains H8269 in the camp H4264 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804. So he returned H7725 (8799) with shame H1322 of face H6440 to his own land H0776. And when he was come H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of his god H0430, they that came forth H3329 of his own bowels H4578 slew H5307 (8689) him there with the sword H2719.
032:022 Thus the LORD H3068 saved H3467 (8686) Hezekiah H3169 and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 from the hand H3027 of Sennacherib H5576 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, and from the hand H3027 of all [other], and guided H5095 (8762) them on every side H5439.
032:023 And many H7227 brought H0935 (8688) gifts H4503 unto the LORD H3068 to Jerusalem H3389, and presents H4030 to Hezekiah H3169 king H4428 of Judah H3063: so that he was magnified H5375 (8735) in the sight H5869 of all nations H1471 from thenceforth H0310.
032:024 In those days H3117 Hezekiah H3169 was sick H2470 (8804) to the death H4191 (8800), and prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068: and he spake H0559 (8799) unto him, and he gave H5414 (8804) him a sign H4159.
032:025 But Hezekiah H3169 rendered not again H7725 (8689) according to the benefit H1576 [done] unto him; for his heart H3820 was lifted up H1361 (8804): therefore there was wrath H7110 upon him, and upon Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389.
032:026 Notwithstanding Hezekiah H3169 humbled H3665 (8735) himself for the pride H1363 of his heart H3820, [both] he and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, so that the wrath H7110 of the LORD H3068 came H0935 (8804) not upon them in the days H3117 of Hezekiah H3169.
032:027 And Hezekiah H3169 had exceeding H3966 much H7235 (8687) riches H6239 and honour H3519: and he made H6213 (8804) himself treasuries H0214 for silver H3701, and for gold H2091, and for precious H3368 stones H0068, and for spices H1314, and for shields H4043, and for all manner of pleasant H2532 jewels H3627;
032:028 Storehouses H4543 also for the increase H8393 of corn H1715, and wine H8492, and oil H3323; and stalls H0723 for all manner of beasts H0929, and cotes H0220 for flocks H5739.
032:029 Moreover he provided H6213 (8804) him cities H5892, and possessions H4735 of flocks H6629 and herds H1241 in abundance H7230: for God H0430 had given H5414 (8804) him substance H7399 very H3966 much H7227.
032:030 This same Hezekiah H3169 also stopped H5640 (8804) the upper H5945 watercourse H4161 H4325 of Gihon H1521, and brought it straight H3474 (8762) down H4295 to the west side H4628 of the city H5892 of David H1732. And Hezekiah H3169 prospered H6743 (8686) in all his works H4639.
032:031 Howbeit H3651 in [the business of] the ambassadors H3887 (8688) of the princes H8269 of Babylon H0894, who sent H7971 (8764) unto him to enquire H1875 (8800) of the wonder H4159 that was [done] in the land H0776, God H0430 left H5800 (8804) him, to try H5254 (8763) him, that he might know H3045 (8800) all [that was] in his heart H3824.
032:032 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Hezekiah H3169, and his goodness H2617, behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the vision H2377 of Isaiah H3470 the prophet H5030, the son H1121 of Amoz H0531, [and] in the book H5612 of the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 and Israel H3478.
032:033 And Hezekiah H3169 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and they buried H6912 (8799) him in the chiefest H4608 of the sepulchres H6913 of the sons H1121 of David H1732: and all Judah H3063 and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 did him H6213 (8804) honour H3519 at his death H4194. And Manasseh H4519 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
033:001 ¶  Manasseh H4519 [was] twelve H8147 H6240 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) fifty H2572 and five H2568 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389:
033:002 But did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, like unto the abominations H8441 of the heathen H1471, whom the LORD H3068 had cast out H3423 (8689) before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
033:003 For he built H1129 (8799) again H7725 (8799) the high places H1116 which Hezekiah H3169 his father H0001 had broken down H5422 (8765), and he reared up H6965 (8686) altars H4196 for Baalim H1168, and made H6213 (8799) groves H0842, and worshipped H7812 (8691) all the host H6635 of heaven H8064, and served H5647 (8799) them.
033:004 Also he built H1129 (8804) altars H4196 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, whereof the LORD H3068 had said H0559 (8804), In Jerusalem H3389 shall my name H8034 be for ever H5769.
033:005 And he built H1129 (8799) altars H4196 for all the host H6635 of heaven H8064 in the two H8147 courts H2691 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
033:006 And he caused H5674 his children H1121 to pass through H5674 (8689) the fire H0784 in the valley H1516 of the son H1121 of Hinnom H2011: also he observed times H6049 (8782), and used enchantments H5172 (8765), and used witchcraft H3784 (8765), and dealt H6213 (8804) with a familiar spirit H0178, and with wizards H3049: he wrought H6213 (8800) much H7235 (8689) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, to provoke him to anger H3707 (8687).
033:007 And he set H7760 (8799) a carved image H6459, the idol H5566 which he had made H6213 (8804), in the house H1004 of God H0430, of which God H0430 had said H0559 (8804) to David H1732 and to Solomon H8010 his son H1121, In this house H1004, and in Jerusalem H3389, which I have chosen H0977 (8804) before all the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, will I put H7760 (8799) my name H8034 for ever H5865:
033:008 Neither will I any more H3254 (8686) remove H5493 (8687) the foot H7272 of Israel H3478 from out H5921 of the land H0127 which I have appointed H5975 (8689) for your fathers H0001; so that H0518 they will take heed H8104 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) all that I have commanded H6680 (8765) them, according to the whole law H8451 and the statutes H2706 and the ordinances H4941 by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
033:009 So Manasseh H4519 made H8582 Judah H3063 and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 to err H8582 (8686), [and] to do H6213 (8800) worse H7451 than the heathen H1471, whom the LORD H3068 had destroyed H8045 (8689) before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
033:010 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) to Manasseh H4519, and to his people H5971: but they would not hearken H7181 (8689).
033:011 Wherefore the LORD H3068 brought H0935 (8686) upon them the captains of H8269 the host of H6635 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, which took H3920 (8799) Manasseh H4519 among the thorns H2336, and bound him H0631 (8799) with fetters H5178, and carried H3212 (8686) him to Babylon H0894.
033:012 And when he was in affliction H6887 (8687), he besought H2470 (8765) the LORD H3068 his God H0430, and humbled H3665 (8735) himself greatly H3966 before H6440 the God H0430 of his fathers H0001,
033:013 And prayed H6419 (8691) unto him: and he was intreated H6279 (8735) of him, and heard H8085 (8799) his supplication H8467, and brought him again H7725 (8686) to Jerusalem H3389 into his kingdom H4438. Then Manasseh H4519 knew H3045 (8799) that the LORD H3068 he [was] God H0430.
033:014 Now after this H0310 he built H1129 (8804) a wall H2346 without H2435 the city H5892 of David H1732, on the west side H4628 of Gihon H1521, in the valley H5158, even to the entering in H0935 (8800) at the fish H1709 gate H8179, and compassed H5437 (8804) about Ophel H6077, and raised it up H1361 (8686) a very great height H3966, and put H7760 (8799) captains H8269 of war H2428 in all the fenced H1219 (8803) cities H5892 of Judah H3063.
033:015 And he took away H5493 (8686) the strange H5236 gods H0430, and the idol H5566 out of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and all the altars H4196 that he had built H1129 (8804) in the mount H2022 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and in Jerusalem H3389, and cast H7993 (8686) [them] out H2351 of the city H5892.
033:016 And he repaired H1129 (8799) the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068, and sacrificed H2076 (8799) thereon peace H8002 offerings H2077 and thank offerings H8426, and commanded H0559 (8799) Judah H3063 to serve H5647 (8800) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
033:017 Nevertheless H0061 the people H5971 did sacrifice H2076 (8802) still in the high places H1116, [yet] unto the LORD H3068 their God H0430 only.
033:018 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Manasseh H4519, and his prayer H8605 unto his God H0430, and the words H1697 of the seers H2374 that spake H1696 (8764) to him in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, behold, they [are written] in the book H1697 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478.
033:019 His prayer H8605 also, and [how God] was intreated H6279 (8736) of him, and all his sin H2403, and his trespass H4604, and the places H4725 wherein he built H1129 (8804) high places H1116, and set up H5975 (8689) groves H0842 and graven images H6456, before H6440 he was humbled H3665 (8736): behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) among the sayings H1697 of the seers H2374 (8676) H2335.
033:020 So Manasseh H4519 slept H7901 (8799) with his fathers H0001, and they buried H6912 (8799) him in his own house H1004: and Amon H0526 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
033:021 Amon H0526 [was] two H8147 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and reigned H4427 (8804) two H8147 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389.
033:022 But he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, as did H6213 (8804) Manasseh H4519 his father H0001: for Amon H0526 sacrificed H2076 (8765) unto all the carved images H6456 which Manasseh H4519 his father H0001 had made H6213 (8804), and served H5647 (8799) them;
033:023 And humbled H3665 (8738) not himself before H6440 the LORD H3068, as Manasseh H4519 his father H0001 had humbled H3665 (8736) himself; but Amon H0526 trespassed H0819 more and more H7235 (8689).
033:024 And his servants H5650 conspired H7194 (8799) against him, and slew H4191 (8686) him in his own house H1004.
033:025 But the people H5971 of the land H0776 slew H5221 (8686) all them that had conspired H7194 (8802) against king H4428 Amon H0526; and the people H5971 of the land H0776 made H4427 Josiah H2977 his son H1121 king H4427 (8686) in his stead.
034:001 ¶  Josiah H2977 [was] eight H8083 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) in Jerusalem H3389 one H0259 and thirty H7970 years H8141.
034:002 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] right H3477 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, and walked H3212 (8799) in the ways H1870 of David H1732 his father H0001, and declined H5493 (8804) [neither] to the right hand H3225, nor to the left H8040.
034:003 For in the eighth H8083 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800), while he was yet young H5288, he began H2490 (8689) to seek H1875 (8800) after the God H0430 of David H1732 his father H0001: and in the twelfth H8147 H6240 year H8141 he began H2490 (8689) to purge H2891 (8763) Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389 from the high places H1116, and the groves H0842, and the carved images H6456, and the molten images H4541.
034:004 And they brake down H5422 (8762) the altars H4196 of Baalim H1168 in his presence H6440; and the images H2553, that [were] on high above them H4605, he cut down H1438 (8765); and the groves H0842, and the carved images H6456, and the molten images H4541, he brake in pieces H7665 (8765), and made dust H1854 (8689) [of them], and strowed H2236 (8799) [it] upon H6440 the graves H6913 of them that had sacrificed H2076 (8802) unto them.
034:005 And he burnt H8313 (8804) the bones H6106 of the priests H3548 upon their altars H4196, and cleansed H2891 (8762) Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389.
034:006 And [so did he] in the cities H5892 of Manasseh H4519, and Ephraim H0669, and Simeon H8095, even unto Naphtali H5321, with their mattocks H2719 round about H5439.
034:007 And when he had broken down H5422 (8762) the altars H4196 and the groves H0842, and had beaten H3807 (8765) the graven images H6456 into powder H1854 (8687), and cut down H1438 (8765) all the idols H2553 throughout all the land H0776 of Israel H3478, he returned H7725 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
034:008 Now in the eighteenth H8083 H6240 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800), when he had purged H2891 (8763) the land H0776, and the house H1004, he sent H7971 (8804) Shaphan H8227 the son H1121 of Azaliah H0683, and Maaseiah H4641 the governor H8269 of the city H5892, and Joah H3098 the son H1121 of Joahaz H3099 the recorder H2142 (8688), to repair H2388 (8763) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 his God H0430.
034:009 And when they came H0935 (8799) to Hilkiah H2518 the high H1419 priest H3548, they delivered H5414 (8799) the money H3701 that was brought H0935 (8716) into the house H1004 of God H0430, which the Levites H3881 that kept H8104 (8802) the doors H5592 had gathered H0622 (8804) of the hand H3027 of Manasseh H4519 and Ephraim H0669, and of all the remnant H7611 of Israel H3478, and of all Judah H3063 and Benjamin H1144; and they returned H7725 (8799) (8675) H3427 (8802) to Jerusalem H3389.
034:010 And they put H5414 (8799) [it] in the hand H3027 of the workmen H6213 (8802) H4399 that had the oversight H6485 (8716) of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and they gave H5414 (8799) it to the workmen H6213 (8802) H4399 that wrought H6213 (8802) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, to repair H0918 (8800) and amend H2388 (8763) the house H1004:
034:011 Even to the artificers H2796 and builders H1129 (8802) gave H5414 (8799) they [it], to buy H7069 (8800) hewn H4274 stone H0068, and timber H6086 for couplings H4226, and to floor H7136 (8763) the houses H1004 which the kings H4428 of Judah H3063 had destroyed H7843 (8689).
034:012 And the men H0582 did H6213 (8802) the work H4399 faithfully H0530: and the overseers H5329 (8763) of them [were] Jahath H3189 and Obadiah H5662, the Levites H3881, of the sons H1121 of Merari H4847; and Zechariah H2148 and Meshullam H4918, of the sons of the Kohathites H6956, to set [it] forward H6485 (8716); and [other of] the Levites H3881, all that could skill H0995 (8688) of instruments H3627 of musick H7892.
034:013 Also [they were] over the bearers of burdens H5449, and [were] overseers H5329 (8764) of all that wrought H6213 (8802) the work H4399 in any manner of service H5656: and of the Levites H3881 [there were] scribes H5608 (8802), and officers H7860 (8802), and porters H7778.
034:014 And when they brought out H3318 (8687) the money H3701 that was brought into H0935 (8716) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, Hilkiah H2518 the priest H3548 found H4672 (8804) a book H5612 of the law H8451 of the LORD H3068 [given] by H3027 Moses H4872.
034:015 And Hilkiah H2518 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) to Shaphan H8227 the scribe H5608 (8802), I have found H4672 (8804) the book H5612 of the law H8451 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068. And Hilkiah H2518 delivered H5414 (8799) the book H5612 to Shaphan H8227.
034:016 And Shaphan H8227 carried H0935 (8686) the book H5612 to the king H4428, and brought H7725 the king H4428 word H1697 back H7725 (8686) again, saying H0559 (8800), All that was committed H5414 (8738) to H3027 thy servants H5650, they do H6213 (8802) [it].
034:017 And they have gathered together H5413 (8686) the money H3701 that was found H4672 (8737) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and have delivered H5414 (8799) it into the hand H3027 of the overseers H6485 (8716), and to the hand H3027 of the workmen H6213 (8802) H4399.
034:018 Then Shaphan H8227 the scribe H5608 (8802) told H5046 (8686) the king H4428, saying H0559 (8800), Hilkiah H2518 the priest H3548 hath given H5414 (8804) me a book H5612. And Shaphan H8227 read H7121 (8799) it before H6440 the king H4428.
034:019 And it came to pass, when the king H4428 had heard H8085 (8800) the words H1697 of the law H8451, that he rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H0899.
034:020 And the king H4428 commanded H6680 (8762) Hilkiah H2518, and Ahikam H0296 the son H1121 of Shaphan H8227, and Abdon H5658 the son H1121 of Micah H4318, and Shaphan H8227 the scribe H5608 (8802), and Asaiah H6222 a servant H5650 of the king’s H4428, saying H0559 (8800),
034:021 Go H3212 (8798), enquire H1875 (8798) of the LORD H3068 for me, and for them that are left H7604 (8737) in Israel H3478 and in Judah H3063, concerning the words H1697 of the book H5612 that is found H4672 (8738): for great H1419 [is] the wrath H2534 of the LORD H3068 that is poured out H5413 (8738) upon us, because our fathers H0001 have not kept H8104 (8804) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, to do H6213 (8800) after all that is written H3789 (8803) in this book H5612.
034:022 And Hilkiah H2518, and [they] that the king H4428 [had appointed], went H3212 (8799) to Huldah H2468 the prophetess H5031, the wife H0802 of Shallum H7967 the son H1121 of Tikvath H8616 (8676) H8445, the son H1121 of Hasrah H2641, keeper H8104 (8802) of the wardrobe H0899; (now she dwelt H3427 (8802) in Jerusalem H3389 in the college H4932:) and they spake H1696 (8762) to her to that [effect].
034:023 And she answered H0559 (8799) them, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, Tell H0559 (8798) ye the man H0376 that sent H7971 (8804) you to me,
034:024 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will bring H0935 (8688) evil H7451 upon this place H4725, and upon the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof, [even] all the curses H0423 that are written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 which they have read H7121 (8804) before H6440 the king H4428 of Judah H3063:
034:025 Because they have forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and have burned incense H6999 (8762) (8675) H6999 (8686) unto other H0312 gods H0430, that they might provoke me to anger H3707 (8687) with all the works H4639 of their hands H3027; therefore my wrath H2534 shall be poured out H5413 (8799) upon this place H4725, and shall not be quenched H3518 (8799).
034:026 And as for H0413 the king H4428 of Judah H3063, who sent H7971 (8802) you to enquire H1875 (8800) of the LORD H3068, so shall ye say H0559 (8799) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 [concerning] the words H1697 which thou hast heard H8085 (8804);
034:027 Because thine heart H3824 was tender H7401 (8804), and thou didst humble H3665 (8735) thyself before H6440 God H0430, when thou heardest H8085 (8800) his words H1697 against this place H4725, and against the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof, and humbledst H3665 (8735) thyself before H6440 me, and didst rend H7167 (8799) thy clothes H0899, and weep H1058 (8799) before H6440 me; I have even heard H8085 (8804) [thee] also, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
034:028 Behold, I will gather H0622 (8802) thee to thy fathers H0001, and thou shalt be gathered H0622 (8738) to thy grave H6913 in peace H7965, neither shall thine eyes H5869 see H7200 (8799) all the evil H7451 that I will bring H0935 (8688) upon this place H4725, and upon the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the same. So they brought H7725 the king H4428 word H1697 again H7725 (8686).
034:029 Then the king H4428 sent H7971 (8799) and gathered together H0622 (8799) all the elders H2205 of Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389.
034:030 And the king H4428 went up H5927 (8799) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and all the men H0376 of Judah H3063, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, and the priests H3548, and the Levites H3881, and all the people H5971, great H1419 and small H6996: and he read H7121 (8799) in their ears H0241 all the words H1697 of the book H5612 of the covenant H1285 that was found H4672 (8737) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
034:031 And the king H4428 stood H5975 (8799) in his place H5977, and made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 before H6440 the LORD H3068, to walk H3212 (8800) after H0310 the LORD H3068, and to keep H8104 (8800) his commandments H4687, and his testimonies H5715, and his statutes H2706, with all his heart H3824, and with all his soul H5315, to perform H6213 (8800) the words H1697 of the covenant H1285 which are written H3789 (8803) in this book H5612.
034:032 And he caused all that were present H4672 (8737) in Jerusalem H3389 and Benjamin H1144 to stand H5975 (8686) [to it]. And the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389 did H6213 (8799) according to the covenant H1285 of God H0430, the God H0430 of their fathers H0001.
034:033 And Josiah H2977 took away H5493 (8686) all the abominations H8441 out of all the countries H0776 that [pertained] to the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and made all that were present H4672 (8737) in Israel H3478 to serve H5647 (8686), [even] to serve H5647 (8800) the LORD H3068 their God H0430. [And] all his days H3117 they departed H5493 (8804) not from following H0310 the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of their fathers H0001.
035:001 ¶  Moreover Josiah H2977 kept H6213 (8799) a passover H6453 unto the LORD H3068 in Jerusalem H3389: and they killed H7819 (8799) the passover H6453 on the fourteenth H0702 H6240 [day] of the first H7223 month H2320.
035:002 And he set H5975 (8686) the priests H3548 in their charges H4931, and encouraged H2388 (8762) them to the service H5656 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068,
035:003 And said H0559 (8799) unto the Levites H3881 that taught H0995 (8688) (8675) H4000 all Israel H3478, which were holy H6918 unto the LORD H3068, Put H5414 (8798) the holy H6944 ark H0727 in the house H1004 which Solomon H8010 the son H1121 of David H1732 king H4428 of Israel H3478 did build H1129 (8804); [it shall] not [be] a burden H4853 upon [your] shoulders H3802: serve H5647 (8798) now the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and his people H5971 Israel H3478,
035:004 And prepare H3559 (8685) (8675) H3559 (8734) [yourselves] by the houses H1004 of your fathers H0001, after your courses H4256, according to the writing H3791 of David H1732 king H4428 of Israel H3478, and according to the writing H4385 of Solomon H8010 his son H1121.
035:005 And stand in H5975 (8798) the holy H6944 [place] according to the divisions H6391 of the families H1004 of the fathers H0001 of your brethren H0251 the people H1121 H5971, and [after] the division H2515 of the families H0001 H1004 of the Levites H3881.
035:006 So kill H7819 (8798) the passover H6453, and sanctify H6942 (8690) yourselves, and prepare H3559 (8685) your brethren H0251, that [they] may do H6213 (8800) according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
035:007 And Josiah H2977 gave H7311 (8686) to the people H1121 H5971, of the flock H6629, lambs H3532 and kids H1121 H5795, all for the passover offerings H6453, for all that were present H4672 (8737), to the number H4557 of thirty H7970 thousand H0505, and three H7969 thousand H0505 bullocks H1241: these [were] of the king’s H4428 substance H7399.
035:008 And his princes H8269 gave H7311 (8689) willingly H5071 unto the people H5971, to the priests H3548, and to the Levites H3881: Hilkiah H2518 and Zechariah H2148 and Jehiel H3171, rulers H5057 of the house H1004 of God H0430, gave H5414 (8804) unto the priests H3548 for the passover offerings H6453 two thousand H0505 and six H8337 hundred H3967 [small cattle], and three H7969 hundred H3967 oxen H1241.
035:009 Conaniah H3562 also, and Shemaiah H8098 and Nethaneel H5417, his brethren H0251, and Hashabiah H2811 and Jeiel H3273 and Jozabad H3107, chief H8269 of the Levites H3881, gave H7311 (8689) unto the Levites H3881 for passover offerings H6453 five H2568 thousand H0505 [small cattle], and five H2568 hundred H3967 oxen H1241.
035:010 So the service H5656 was prepared H3559 (8735), and the priests H3548 stood H5975 (8799) in their place H5977, and the Levites H3881 in their courses H4256, according to the king’s H4428 commandment H4687.
035:011 And they killed H7819 (8799) the passover H6453, and the priests H3548 sprinkled H2236 (8799) [the blood] from their hands H3027, and the Levites H3881 flayed H6584 (8688) [them].
035:012 And they removed H5493 (8686) the burnt offerings H5930, that they might give H5414 (8800) according to the divisions H4653 of the families H0001 H1004 of the people H1121 H5971, to offer H7126 (8687) unto the LORD H3068, as [it is] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of Moses H4872. And so [did they] with the oxen H1241.
035:013 And they roasted H1310 (8762) the passover H6453 with fire H0784 according to the ordinance H4941: but the [other] holy H6944 [offerings] sod H1310 (8765) they in pots H5518, and in caldrons H1731, and in pans H6745, and divided [them] speedily H7323 (8686) among all the people H1121 H5971.
035:014 And afterward H0310 they made ready H3559 (8689) for themselves, and for the priests H3548: because the priests H3548 the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 [were busied] in offering H5927 (8687) of burnt offerings H5930 and the fat H2459 until night H3915; therefore the Levites H3881 prepared H3559 (8689) for themselves, and for the priests H3548 the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175.
035:015 And the singers H7891 (8789) the sons H1121 of Asaph H0623 [were] in their place H4612, according to the commandment H4687 of David H1732, and Asaph H0623, and Heman H1968, and Jeduthun H3038 the king’s H4428 seer H2374; and the porters H7778 [waited] at every gate H8179; they might not depart H5493 (8800) from their service H5656; for their brethren H0251 the Levites H3881 prepared H3559 (8689) for them.
035:016 So all the service H5656 of the LORD H3068 was prepared H3559 (8735) the same day H3117, to keep H6213 (8800) the passover H6453, and to offer H5927 (8687) burnt offerings H5930 upon the altar H4196 of the LORD H3068, according to the commandment H4687 of king H4428 Josiah H2977.
035:017 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 that were present H4672 (8737) kept H6213 (8799) the passover H6453 at that time H6256, and the feast H2282 of unleavened bread H4682 seven H7651 days H3117.
035:018 And there was no passover H6453 like H3644 to that kept H6213 (8738) in Israel H3478 from the days H3117 of Samuel H8050 the prophet H5030; neither did H6213 (8804) all the kings H4428 of Israel H3478 keep H6213 (8804) such a passover H6453 as Josiah H2977 kept H6213 (8804), and the priests H3548, and the Levites H3881, and all Judah H3063 and Israel H3478 that were present H4672 (8737), and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389.
035:019 In the eighteenth H8083 H6240 year H8141 of the reign H4438 of Josiah H2977 was this passover H6453 kept H6213 (8738).
035:020 After H0310 all this, when Josiah H2977 had prepared H3559 (8689) the temple H1004, Necho H5224 king H4428 of Egypt H4714 came up H5927 (8804) to fight H3898 (8736) against Carchemish H3751 by Euphrates H6578: and Josiah H2977 went out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) him.
035:021 But he sent H7971 (8799) ambassadors H4397 to him, saying H0559 (8800), What have I to do with thee, thou king H4428 of Judah H3063? [I come] not against thee this day H3117, but against the house H1004 wherewith I have war H4421: for God H0430 commanded H0559 (8804) me to make haste H0926 (8763): forbear H2308 (8798) thee from [meddling with] God H0430, who [is] with me, that he destroy H7843 (8686) thee not.
035:022 Nevertheless Josiah H2977 would not turn H5437 (8689) his face H6440 from him, but disguised H2664 (8694) himself, that he might fight H3898 (8736) with him, and hearkened H8085 (8804) not unto the words H1697 of Necho H5224 from the mouth H6310 of God H0430, and came H0935 (8799) to fight H3898 (8736) in the valley H1237 of Megiddo H4023.
035:023 And the archers H3384 (8802) shot H3384 (8686) at king H4428 Josiah H2977; and the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) to his servants H5650, Have me away H5674 (8685); for I am sore H3966 wounded H2470 (8717).
035:024 His servants H5650 therefore took H5674 (8686) him out of that chariot H4818, and put H7392 (8686) him in the second H4932 chariot H7393 that he had; and they brought H3212 (8686) him to Jerusalem H3389, and he died H4191 (8799), and was buried H6912 (8735) in [one of] the sepulchres H6913 of his fathers H0001. And all Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389 mourned H0056 (8693) for Josiah H2977.
035:025 And Jeremiah H3414 lamented H6969 (8787) for Josiah H2977: and all the singing men H7891 (8802) and the singing women H7891 (8802) spake H0559 (8799) of Josiah H2977 in their lamentations H7015 to this day H3117, and made H5414 (8799) them an ordinance H2706 in Israel H3478: and, behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the lamentations H7015.
035:026 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Josiah H2977, and his goodness H2617, according to [that which was] written H3789 (8803) in the law H8451 of the LORD H3068,
035:027 And his deeds H1697, first H7223 and last H0314, behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478 and Judah H3063.
036:001 ¶  Then the people H5971 of the land H0776 took H3947 (8799) Jehoahaz H3059 the son H1121 of Josiah H2977, and made him king H4427 (8686) in his father’s H0001 stead in Jerusalem H3389.
036:002 Jehoahaz H3099 [was] twenty H6242 and three H7969 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) three H7969 months H2320 in Jerusalem H3389.
036:003 And the king H4428 of Egypt H4714 put him down H5493 (8686) at Jerusalem H3389, and condemned H6064 (8799) the land H0776 in an hundred H3967 talents H3603 of silver H3701 and a talent H3603 of gold H2091.
036:004 And the king H4428 of Egypt H4714 made Eliakim H0471 his brother H0251 king H4427 (8686) over Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389, and turned H5437 (8686) his name H8034 to Jehoiakim H3079. And Necho H5224 took H3947 (8804) Jehoahaz H3099 his brother H0251, and carried H0935 (8686) him to Egypt H4714.
036:005 Jehoiakim H3079 [was] twenty H6242 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) eleven H0259 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389: and he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 his God H0430.
036:006 Against him came up H5927 (8804) Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and bound H0631 (8799) him in fetters H5178, to carry H3212 (8687) him to Babylon H0894.
036:007 Nebuchadnezzar H5019 also carried H0935 (8689) of the vessels H3627 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 to Babylon H0894, and put H5414 (8799) them in his temple H1964 at Babylon H0894.
036:008 Now the rest H3499 of the acts H1697 of Jehoiakim H3079, and his abominations H8441 which he did H6213 (8804), and that which was found H4672 (8737) in him, behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612 of the kings H4428 of Israel H3478 and Judah H3063: and Jehoiachin H3078 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
036:009 Jehoiachin H3078 [was] eight H8083 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and he reigned H4427 (8804) three H7969 months H2320 and ten H6235 days H3117 in Jerusalem H3389: and he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068.
036:010 And when the year H8141 was expired H8666, king H4428 Nebuchadnezzar H5019 sent H7971 (8804), and brought H0935 (8686) him to Babylon H0894, with the goodly H2532 vessels H3627 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and made Zedekiah H6667 his brother H0251 king H4427 (8686) over Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389.
036:011 Zedekiah H6667 [was] one H0259 and twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 when he began to reign H4427 (8800), and reigned H4427 (8804) eleven H0259 H6240 years H8141 in Jerusalem H3389.
036:012 And he did H6213 (8799) [that which was] evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 his God H0430, [and] humbled H3665 (8738) not himself before H6440 Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030 [speaking] from the mouth H6310 of the LORD H3068.
036:013 And he also rebelled H4775 (8804) against king H4428 Nebuchadnezzar H5019, who had made him swear H7650 (8689) by God H0430: but he stiffened H7185 (8686) his neck H6203, and hardened H0553 (8762) his heart H3824 from turning H7725 (8800) unto the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
036:014 Moreover all the chief H8269 of the priests H3548, and the people H5971, transgressed H4603 (8800) very H4604 much H7235 (8689) after all the abominations H8441 of the heathen H1471; and polluted H2930 (8762) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 which he had hallowed H6942 (8689) in Jerusalem H3389.
036:015 And the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001 sent H7971 (8799) to them by H3027 his messengers H4397, rising up betimes H7925 (8687), and sending H7971 (8800); because he had compassion H2550 (8804) on his people H5971, and on his dwelling place H4583:
036:016 But they mocked H3931 (8688) the messengers H4397 of God H0430, and despised H0959 (8802) his words H1697, and misused H8591 (8700) his prophets H5030, until the wrath H2534 of the LORD H3068 arose H5927 (8800) against his people H5971, till [there was] no remedy H4832.
036:017 Therefore he brought H5927 (8686) upon them the king H4428 of the Chaldees H3778, who slew H2026 (8799) their young men H0970 with the sword H2719 in the house H1004 of their sanctuary H4720, and had no compassion H2550 (8804) upon young man H0970 or maiden H1330, old man H2205, or him that stooped for age H3486: he gave H5414 (8804) [them] all into his hand H3027.
036:018 And all the vessels H3627 of the house H1004 of God H0430, great H1419 and small H6996, and the treasures H0214 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and the treasures H0214 of the king H4428, and of his princes H8269; all [these] he brought H0935 (8689) to Babylon H0894.
036:019 And they burnt H8313 (8799) the house H1004 of God H0430, and brake down H5422 (8762) the wall H2346 of Jerusalem H3389, and burnt H8313 (8804) all the palaces H0759 thereof with fire H0784, and destroyed H7843 (8687) all the goodly H4261 vessels H3627 thereof.
036:020 And them that had escaped H7611 from the sword H2719 carried he away H1540 (8686) to Babylon H0894; where they were servants H5650 to him and his sons H1121 until the reign H4427 (8800) of the kingdom H4438 of Persia H6539:
036:021 To fulfil H4390 (8763) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 by the mouth H6310 of Jeremiah H3414, until the land H0776 had enjoyed H7521 (8804) her sabbaths H7676: [for] as long as H3117 she lay desolate H8074 (8715) she kept sabbath H7673 (8804), to fulfil H4390 (8763) threescore and ten H7657 years H8141.
036:022 Now in the first H0259 year H8141 of Cyrus H3566 king H4428 of Persia H6539, that the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 [spoken] by the mouth H6310 of Jeremiah H3414 might be accomplished H3615 (8800), the LORD H3068 stirred up H5782 (8689) the spirit H7307 of Cyrus H3566 king H4428 of Persia H6539, that he made a proclamation H5674 (8686) H6963 throughout all his kingdom H4438, and [put it] also in writing H4385, saying H0559 (8800),
036:023 Thus saith H0559 (8804) Cyrus H3566 king H4428 of Persia H6539, All the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776 hath the LORD H3068 God H0430 of heaven H8064 given H5414 (8804) me; and he hath charged H6485 (8804) me to build H1129 (8800) him an house H1004 in Jerusalem H3389, which [is] in Judah H3063. Who [is there] among you of all his people H5971? The LORD H3068 his God H0430 [be] with him, and let him go up H5927 (8799).
