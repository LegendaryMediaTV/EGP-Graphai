001:001 ¶  In the third H7969 year H8141 of the reign H4438 of Jehoiakim H3079 king H4428 of Judah H3063 came H0935 (8804) Nebuchadnezzar H5019 king H4428 of Babylon H0894 unto Jerusalem H3389, and besieged H6696 (8799) it.
001:002 And the Lord H0136 gave H5414 (8799) Jehoiakim H3079 king H4428 of Judah H3063 into his hand H3027, with part H7117 of the vessels H3627 of the house H1004 of God H0430: which he carried H0935 (8686) into the land H0776 of Shinar H8152 to the house H1004 of his god H0430; and he brought H0935 (8689) the vessels H3627 into the treasure H0214 house H1004 of his god H0430.
001:003 And the king H4428 spake H0559 (8799) unto Ashpenaz H0828 the master H7227 of his eunuchs H5631, that he should bring H0935 (8687) [certain] of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and of the king’s H4410 seed H2233, and of the princes H6579;
001:004 Children H3206 in whom [was] no blemish H3971 (8675) H3971, but well H2896 favoured H4758, and skilful H7919 (8688) in all wisdom H2451, and cunning H3045 (8802) in knowledge H1847, and understanding H0995 (8688) science H4093, and such as [had] ability H3581 in them to stand H5975 (8800) in the king’s H4428 palace H1964, and whom they might teach H3925 (8763) the learning H5612 and the tongue H3956 of the Chaldeans H3778.
001:005 And the king H4428 appointed H4487 (8762) them a daily H3117 H3117 provision H1697 of the king’s H4428 meat H6598, and of the wine H3196 which he drank H4960: so nourishing H1431 (8763) them three H7969 years H8141, that at the end H7117 thereof they might stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 the king H4428.
001:006 Now among these were of the children H1121 of Judah H3063, Daniel H1840, Hananiah H2608, Mishael H4332, and Azariah H5838:
001:007 Unto whom the prince H8269 of the eunuchs H5631 gave H7760 (8799) names H8034: for he gave H7760 (8799) unto Daniel H1840 [the name] of Belteshazzar H1095; and to Hananiah H2608, of Shadrach H7714; and to Mishael H4332, of Meshach H4335; and to Azariah H5838, of Abednego H5664.
001:008 But Daniel H1840 purposed H7760 (8799) in his heart H3820 that he would not defile H1351 (8691) himself with the portion H6598 of the king’s H4428 meat H6598, nor with the wine H3196 which he drank H4960: therefore he requested H1245 (8762) of the prince H8269 of the eunuchs H5631 that he might not defile H1351 (8691) himself.
001:009 Now God H0430 had brought H5414 (8799) Daniel H1840 into favour H2617 and tender love H7356 with H6440 the prince H8269 of the eunuchs H5631.
001:010 And the prince H8269 of the eunuchs H5631 said H0559 (8799) unto Daniel H1840, I fear H3373 my lord H0113 the king H4428, who hath appointed H4487 (8765) your meat H3978 and your drink H4960: for why should he see H7200 (8799) your faces H6440 worse liking H2196 (8802) than the children H3206 which [are] of your sort H1524? then shall ye make [me] endanger H2325 (8765) my head H7218 to the king H4428.
001:011 Then said H0559 (8799) Daniel H1840 to Melzar H4453, whom the prince H8269 of the eunuchs H5631 had set H4487 (8765) over Daniel H1840, Hananiah H2608, Mishael H4332, and Azariah H5838,
001:012 Prove H5254 (8761) thy servants H5650, I beseech thee, ten H6235 days H3117; and let them give H5414 (8799) us pulse H2235 to eat H0398 (8799), and water H4325 to drink H8354 (8799).
001:013 Then let our countenances H4758 be looked upon H7200 (8735) before H6440 thee, and the countenance H4758 of the children H3206 that eat H0398 (8802) of the portion H6598 of the king’s H4428 meat H6598: and as thou seest H7200 (8799), deal H6213 (8798) with thy servants H5650.
001:014 So he consented H8085 (8799) to them in this matter H1697, and proved H5254 (8762) them ten H6235 days H3117.
001:015 And at the end H7117 of ten H6235 days H3117 their countenances H4758 appeared H7200 (8738) fairer H2896 and fatter H1277 in flesh H1320 than all the children H3206 which did eat H0398 (8802) the portion H6598 of the king’s H4428 meat H6598.
001:016 Thus Melzar H4453 took away H5375 (8802) the portion of their meat H6598, and the wine H3196 that they should drink H4960; and gave H5414 (8802) them pulse H2235.
001:017 As for these four H0702 children H3206, God H0430 gave H5414 (8804) them knowledge H4093 and skill H7919 (8687) in all learning H5612 and wisdom H2451: and Daniel H1840 had understanding H0995 (8689) in all visions H2377 and dreams H2472.
001:018 Now at the end H7117 of the days H3117 that the king H4428 had said H0559 (8804) he should bring H0935 (8687) them in, then the prince H8269 of the eunuchs H5631 brought H0935 (8686) them in before H6440 Nebuchadnezzar H5019.
001:019 And the king H4428 communed H1696 (8762) with them; and among them all was found H4672 (8738) none like Daniel H1840, Hananiah H2608, Mishael H4332, and Azariah H5838: therefore stood H5975 (8799) they before H6440 the king H4428.
001:020 And in all matters H1697 of wisdom H2451 [and] understanding H0998, that the king H4428 enquired H1245 (8765) of them, he found H4672 (8799) them ten times H6235 better H3027 than all the magicians H2748 [and] astrologers H0825 that [were] in all his realm H4438.
001:021 And Daniel H1840 continued [even] unto the first H0259 year H8141 of king H4428 Cyrus H3566.
002:001 ¶  And in the second H8147 year H8141 of the reign H4438 of Nebuchadnezzar H5019 Nebuchadnezzar H5019 dreamed H2492 (8804) dreams H2472, wherewith his spirit H7307 was troubled H6470 (8691), and his sleep H8142 brake H1961 (8738) from him.
002:002 Then the king H4428 commanded H0559 (8799) to call H7121 (8800) the magicians H2748, and the astrologers H0825, and the sorcerers H3784 (8764), and the Chaldeans H3778, for to shew H5046 (8687) the king H4428 his dreams H2472. So they came H0935 (8799) and stood H5975 (8799) before H6440 the king H4428.
002:003 And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto them, I have dreamed H2492 (8804) a dream H2472, and my spirit H7307 was troubled H6470 (8735) to know H3045 (8800) the dream H2472.
002:004 Then spake H1696 (8762) the Chaldeans H3778 to the king H4428 in Syriack H0762, O king H4430, live H2418 (8747) for ever H5957: tell H0560 (8747) thy servants H5649 the dream H2493, and we will shew H2324 (8741) the interpretation H6591.
002:005 The king H4430 answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750) to the Chaldeans H3779, The thing H4406 is gone H0230 (8754) from me H4481: if H2006 ye will not H3809 make known H3046 (8681) unto me the dream H2493, with the interpretation H6591 thereof, ye shall be cut H5648 (8725) in pieces H1917, and your houses H1005 shall be made H7761 (8725) a dunghill H5122.
002:006 But if H2006 ye shew H2324 (8681) the dream H2493, and the interpretation H6591 thereof, ye shall receive H6902 (8741) of H4481 me H6925 gifts H4978 and rewards H5023 and great H7690 honour H3367: therefore H3861 shew H2324 (8680) me the dream H2493, and the interpretation H6591 thereof.
002:007 They answered H6032 (8754) again H8579 and said H0560 (8750), Let the king H4430 tell H0560 (8748) his servants H5649 the dream H2493, and we will shew H2324 (8681) the interpretation H6591 of it.
002:008 The king H4430 answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750), I H0576 know H3046 (8751) of H4481 certainty H3330 that ye H0608 would gain H2084 (8750) the time H5732, because H6903 H3606 ye see H2370 (8754) the thing H4406 is gone H0230 (8754) from H4481 me.
002:009 But if H2006 ye will not H3809 make known H3046 (8681) unto me the dream H2493, [there is but] one H1932 H2298 decree H1882 for you: for ye have prepared H2164 (8724) lying H3538 and corrupt H7844 (8752) words H4406 to speak H0560 (8749) before H6925 me, till H5705 the time H5732 be changed H8133 (8721): therefore H3861 tell H0560 (8747) me the dream H2493, and I shall know H3046 (8748) that H1768 ye can shew H2324 (8681) me the interpretation H6591 thereof.
002:010 The Chaldeans H3779 answered H6032 (8754) before H6925 the king H4430, and said H0560 (8750), There is H0383 not H3809 a man H0606 upon H5922 the earth H3007 that can H3202 (8748) shew H2324 (8682) the king’s H4430 matter H4406: therefore H6903 H1768 [there is] no H3809 king H4430, lord H7229, nor ruler H7990, [that] asked H7593 (8754) such H1836 things H4406 at any H3606 magician H2749, or astrologer H0826, or Chaldean H3779.
002:011 And [it is] a rare H3358 thing H4406 that the king H4430 requireth H7593 (8751), and there is H0383 none H3809 other H0321 that can shew H2324 (8741) it before H6925 the king H4430, except H3861 the gods H0426, whose dwelling H4070 is H0383 not H3809 with H5974 flesh H1321.
002:012 For H6903 this H1836 cause H3606 the king H4430 was angry H1149 (8754) and very H7690 furious H7108 (8754), and commanded H0560 (8754) to destroy H0007 (8682) all H3606 the wise H2445 [men] of Babylon H0895.
002:013 And the decree H1882 went forth H5312 (8754) that the wise H2445 [men] should be slain H6992 (8726); and they sought H1156 (8754) Daniel H1841 and his fellows H2269 to be slain H6992 (8723).
002:014 Then H0116 Daniel H1841 answered H8421 (8684) with counsel H5843 and wisdom H2942 to Arioch H0746 the captain H7229 of H1768 the king’s H4430 guard H2877, which was gone forth H5312 (8754) to slay H6992 (8742) the wise H2445 [men] of Babylon H0895:
002:015 He answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750) to Arioch H0746 the king’s H4430 captain H7990, Why H4101 H5922 [is] the decree H1882 [so] hasty H2685 (8683) from H4481 H6925 the king H4430? Then H0116 Arioch H0746 made the thing H4406 known H3046 (8684) to Daniel H1841.
002:016 Then Daniel H1841 went in H5954 (8754), and desired H1156 (8754) of H4481 the king H4430 that he would give H5415 (8748) him time H2166, and that he would shew H2324 (8682) the king H4430 the interpretation H6591.
002:017 Then H0116 Daniel H1841 went H0236 (8754) to his house H1005, and made the thing H4406 known H3046 (8684) to Hananiah H2608, Mishael H4333, and Azariah H5839, his companions H2269:
002:018 That they would desire H1156 (8749) mercies H7359 of H4481 H6925 the God H0426 of heaven H8065 concerning H5922 this H1836 secret H7328; that Daniel H1841 and his fellows H2269 should not H3809 perish H0007 (8681) with H5974 the rest H7606 of the wise H2445 [men] of Babylon H0895.
002:019 Then H0116 was the secret H7328 revealed H1541 (8752) unto Daniel H1841 in a night H3916 vision H2376. Then H0116 Daniel H1841 blessed H1289 (8745) the God H0426 of heaven H8065.
002:020 Daniel H1841 answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750), Blessed H1289 (8743) be H1934 (8748) the name H8036 of God H0426 for H4481 ever H5957 and ever H5705 H5957: for wisdom H2452 and might H1370 are H1932 his:
002:021 And he changeth H8133 (8683) the times H5732 and the seasons H2166: he removeth H5709 (8683) kings H4430, and setteth up H6966 (8683) kings H4430: he giveth H3052 (8751) wisdom H2452 unto the wise H2445, and knowledge H4486 to them that know H3046 (8751) understanding H0999:
002:022 He revealeth H1541 (8751) the deep H5994 and secret things H5642 (8743): he knoweth H3046 (8751) what H4101 [is] in the darkness H2816, and the light H5094 dwelleth H8271 (8754) with him H5974.
002:023 I H0576 thank H3029 (8683) thee, and praise H7624 (8743) thee, O thou God H0426 of my fathers H0002, who hast given H3052 (8754) me wisdom H2452 and might H1370, and hast made known H3046 (8684) unto me now H3705 what we desired H1156 (8754) of thee H4481: for thou hast [now] made known H3046 (8684) unto us the king’s H4430 matter H4406.
002:024 Therefore H3606 H6903 H1836 Daniel H1841 went in H5954 (8754) unto H5922 Arioch H0746, whom the king H4430 had ordained H4483 (8745) to destroy H0007 (8682) the wise H2445 [men] of Babylon H0895: he went H0236 (8754) and said H0560 (8754) thus H3652 unto him; Destroy H0007 (8681) not H0409 the wise H2445 [men] of Babylon H0895: bring me in H5954 (8680) before H6925 the king H4430, and I will shew H2324 (8741) unto the king H4430 the interpretation H6591.
002:025 Then H0116 Arioch H0746 brought in H5954 (8684) Daniel H1841 before H6925 the king H4430 in haste H0927 (8726), and said H0560 (8754) thus H3652 unto him, I have found H7912 (8684) a man H1400 of the captives H1123 H1547 of H4481 Judah H3061, that will make known H3046 (8681) unto the king H4430 the interpretation H6591.
002:026 The king H4430 answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750) to Daniel H1841, whose name H8036 [was] Belteshazzar H1096, Art H0383 thou able H3546 (8751) to make known H3046 (8682) unto me the dream H2493 which I have seen H2370 (8754), and the interpretation H6591 thereof?
002:027 Daniel H1841 answered H6032 (8750) in the presence H6925 of the king H4430, and said H0560 (8750), The secret H7328 which the king H4430 hath demanded H7593 (8751) cannot H3202 (8750) H3809 the wise H2445 [men], the astrologers H0826, the magicians H2749, the soothsayers H1505 (8750), shew H2324 (8682) unto the king H4430;
002:028 But H1297 there is H0383 a God H0426 in heaven H8065 that revealeth H1541 (8751) secrets H7328, and maketh known H3046 (8684) to the king H4430 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 what H4101 shall be H1934 (8748) in the latter H0320 days H3118. Thy dream H2493, and the visions H2376 of thy head H7217 upon H5922 thy bed H4903, are these H1836;
002:029 As for thee H0607, O king H4430, thy thoughts H7476 came H5559 (8760) [into thy mind] upon H5922 thy bed H4903, what H4101 should come to pass H1934 (8748) hereafter H0311 H1836: and he that revealeth H1541 (8751) secrets H7328 maketh known H3046 (8684) to thee what H4101 shall come to pass H1934 (8748).
002:030 But as for me H0576, this H1836 secret H7328 is not H3809 revealed H1541 (8752) to me for [any] wisdom H2452 that I have H0383 more than H4481 any H3606 living H2417, but H3861 for [their] sakes H1701 that H5922 shall make known H3046 (8681) the interpretation H6591 to the king H4430, and that thou mightest know H3046 (8748) the thoughts H7476 of thy heart H3825.
002:031 Thou H0607, O king H4430, sawest H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751), and behold H0431 a great H2298 H7690 image H6755. This H1797 great H7229 image H6755, whose brightness H2122 [was] excellent H3493, stood H6966 (8750) before H6903 thee; and the form H7299 thereof [was] terrible H1763 (8753).
002:032 This image’s H6755 head H7217 [was] of fine H2869 gold H1722, his breast H2306 and his arms H1872 of silver H3702, his belly H4577 and his thighs H3410 of brass H5174,
002:033 His legs H8243 of iron H6523, his feet H7271 part H4481 of iron H6523 and part H4481 of clay H2635.
002:034 Thou sawest H2370 (8751) H1934 (8754) till H5705 that a stone H0069 was cut out H1505 (8728) without H3809 hands H3028, which smote H4223 (8754) the image H6755 upon H5922 his feet H7271 [that were] of iron H6523 and clay H2635, and brake H1855 them H1994 to pieces H1855 (8684).
002:035 Then H0116 was the iron H6523, the clay H2635, the brass H5174, the silver H3702, and the gold H1722, broken to pieces H1855 (8754) (8676) H1751 (8754) together H2298, and became H1934 (8754) like the chaff H5784 of H4481 the summer H7007 threshingfloors H0147; and the wind H7308 carried H5376 them H1994 away H5376 (8754), that H3606 no H3809 place H0870 was found H7912 (8728) for them: and the stone H0069 that smote H4223 (8754) the image H6755 became H1934 (8754) a great H7229 mountain H2906, and filled H4391 (8754) the whole H3606 earth H0772.
002:036 This H1836 [is] the dream H2493; and we will tell H0560 (8748) the interpretation H6591 thereof before H6925 the king H4430.
002:037 Thou H0607, O king H4430, [art] a king H4430 of kings H4430: for the God H0426 of heaven H8065 hath given H3052 (8754) thee a kingdom H4437, power H2632, and strength H8632, and glory H3367.
002:038 And wheresoever H3606 the children H1123 of men H0606 dwell H1753 (8748), the beasts H2423 of the field H1251 and the fowls H5776 of the heaven H8065 hath he given H3052 (8754) into thine hand H3028, and hath made thee ruler H7981 (8684) over them all H3606. Thou H0607 [art] this head H7217 of gold H1722.
002:039 And after H0870 thee shall arise H6966 (8748) another H0317 kingdom H4437 inferior H0772 to thee H4481, and another H0317 third H8523 kingdom H4437 of brass H5174, which shall bear rule H7981 (8748) over all H3606 the earth H0772.
002:040 And the fourth H7244 kingdom H4437 shall be H1934 (8748) strong H8624 as iron H6523: forasmuch as iron H6523 breaketh in pieces H1855 (8683) and subdueth H2827 (8751) all H3606 [things]: and as H6903 iron H6523 that breaketh H7490 (8750) all H3606 these H0459, shall it break in pieces H1855 (8681) and bruise H7490 (8748).
002:041 And whereas thou sawest H2370 (8754) the feet H7271 and toes H0677, part H4481 of potters H6353 ’ clay H2635, and part H4481 of iron H6523, the kingdom H4437 shall be H1934 (8748) divided H6386 (8752); but H4481 there shall be H1934 (8748) in it of H4481 the strength H5326 of the iron H6523, forasmuch as H3606 H6903 thou sawest H2370 (8754) the iron H6523 mixed H6151 (8743) with miry H2917 clay H2635.
002:042 And [as] the toes H0677 of the feet H7271 [were] part H4481 of iron H6523, and part H4481 of clay H2635, [so] the kingdom H4437 shall be H1934 (8748) partly H4481 H7118 strong H8624, and partly H4481 H7118 broken H8406 (8750).
002:043 And whereas H1768 thou sawest H2370 (8754) iron H6523 mixed H6151 (8743) with miry H2917 clay H2635, they shall mingle themselves H1934 (8748) H6151 (8723) with the seed H2234 of men H0606: but they shall H1934 (8748) not H3809 cleave H1693 (8751) one H1836 to H5974 another H1836, even H1888 as iron H6523 is not H3809 mixed H6151 (8723) with clay H2635.
002:044 And in the days H3118 of these H0581 kings H4430 shall the God H0426 of heaven H8065 set up H6966 (8681) a kingdom H4437, which shall never H5957 H3809 be destroyed H2255 (8721): and the kingdom H4437 shall not H3809 be left H7662 (8721) to other H0321 people H5972, [but] it shall break in pieces H1855 (8681) and consume H5487 (8681) all H3606 these H0459 kingdoms H4437, and it H1932 shall stand H6966 (8748) for ever H5957.
002:045 Forasmuch as H3606 H6903 thou sawest H2370 (8754) that the stone H0069 was cut out H1505 (8728) of the mountain H2906 without H3809 hands H3028, and that it brake in pieces H1855 (8684) the iron H6523, the brass H5174, the clay H2635, the silver H3702, and the gold H1722; the great H7229 God H0426 hath made known H3046 (8684) to the king H4430 what H4101 shall come to pass H1934 (8748) hereafter H0311 H1836: and the dream H2493 [is] certain H3330, and the interpretation H6591 thereof sure H0540 (8683).
002:046 Then H0116 the king H4430 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 fell H5308 (8754) upon H5922 his face H0600, and worshipped H5457 (8754) Daniel H1841, and commanded H0560 (8754) that they should offer H5260 (8742) an oblation H4504 and sweet odours H5208 unto him.
002:047 The king H4430 answered H6032 (8750) unto Daniel H1841, and said H0560 (8750), Of H4481 a truth H7187 [it is], that H1768 your God H0426 [is] a God H0426 of gods H0426, and a Lord H4756 of kings H4430, and a revealer H1541 (8751) of secrets H7328, seeing thou couldest H3202 (8754) reveal H1541 (8749) this H1836 secret H7328.
002:048 Then H0116 the king H4430 made H7236 Daniel H1841 a great man H7236 (8745), and gave H3052 (8754) him many H7690 great H7260 gifts H4978, and made him ruler H7981 (8684) over H5922 the whole H3606 province H4083 of Babylon H0895, and chief H7229 of the governors H5460 over H5922 all H3606 the wise H2445 [men] of Babylon H0895.
002:049 Then Daniel H1841 requested H1156 (8754) of H4481 the king H4430, and he set H4483 (8745) Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, over H5922 the affairs H5673 of the province H4083 of Babylon H0895: but Daniel H1841 [sat] in the gate H8651 of the king H4430.
003:001 ¶  Nebuchadnezzar H5020 the king H4430 made H5648 (8754) an image H6755 of gold H1722, whose height H7314 [was] threescore H8361 cubits H0521, [and] the breadth H6613 thereof six H8353 cubits H0521: he set it up H6966 (8684) in the plain H1236 of Dura H1757, in the province H4083 of Babylon H0895.
003:002 Then Nebuchadnezzar H5020 the king H4430 sent H7972 (8754) to gather together H3673 (8749) the princes H0324, the governors H5460, and the captains H6347, the judges H0148, the treasurers H1411, the counsellors H1884, the sheriffs H8614, and all H3606 the rulers H7984 of the provinces H4083, to come H0858 (8749) to the dedication H2597 of the image H6755 which Nebuchadnezzar H5020 the king H4430 had set up H6966 (8684).
003:003 Then H0116 the princes H0324, the governors H5460, and captains H6347, the judges H0148, the treasurers H1411, the counsellors H1884, the sheriffs H8614, and all H3606 the rulers H7984 of the provinces H4083, were gathered together H3673 (8723) unto the dedication H2597 of the image H6755 that Nebuchadnezzar H5020 the king H4430 had set up H6966 (8684); and they stood H6966 (8750) before H6903 the image H6755 that Nebuchadnezzar H5020 had set up H6966 (8684).
003:004 Then an herald H3744 cried H7123 (8751) aloud H2429, To you it is commanded H0560 (8750), O people H5972, nations H0524, and languages H3961,
003:005 [That] at what time H5732 ye hear H8086 (8748) the sound H7032 of the cornet H7162, flute H4953, harp H7030 (8675) H7030, sackbut H5443, psaltery H6460, dulcimer H5481, and all H3606 kinds H2178 of musick H2170, ye fall down H5308 (8748) and worship H5457 (8748) the golden H1722 image H6755 that Nebuchadnezzar H5020 the king H4430 hath set up H6966 (8684):
003:006 And whoso H4479 falleth H5308 not H3809 down H5308 (8748) and worshippeth H5457 (8748) shall the same hour H8160 be cast H7412 (8729) into the midst H1459 of a burning H3345 (8751) fiery H5135 furnace H0861.
003:007 Therefore H6903 H1836 at that time H2166, when H1768 all H3606 the people H5972 heard H8086 (8750) the sound H7032 of the cornet H7162, flute H4953, harp H7030 (8675) H7030, sackbut H5443, psaltery H6460, and all H3606 kinds H2178 of musick H2170, all H3606 the people H5972, the nations H0524, and the languages H3961, fell down H5308 (8750) [and] worshipped H5457 (8750) the golden H1722 image H6755 that Nebuchadnezzar H5020 the king H4430 had set up H6966 (8684).
003:008 Wherefore H6903 H3606 at that H1836 time H2166 certain H1400 Chaldeans H3779 came near H7127 (8754), and accused H7170 H0399 (8754) the Jews H3062.
003:009 They spake H6032 (8754) and said H0560 (8750) to the king H4430 Nebuchadnezzar H5020, O king H4430, live H2418 (8747) for ever H5957.
003:010 Thou H0607, O king H4430, hast made H7761 (8754) a decree H2942, that every H3606 man H0606 that shall hear H8086 (8748) the sound H7032 of the cornet H7162, flute H4953, harp H7030 (8675) H7030, sackbut H5443, psaltery H6460, and dulcimer H5481 (8675) H5481, and all H3606 kinds H2178 of musick H2170, shall fall down H5308 (8748) and worship H5457 (8748) the golden H1722 image H6755:
003:011 And whoso H4479 falleth H5308 not H3809 down H5308 (8748) and worshippeth H5457 (8748), [that] he should be cast H7412 (8729) into the midst H1459 of a burning H3345 (8751) fiery H5135 furnace H0861.
003:012 There are H0383 certain H1400 Jews H3062 whom H3487 thou hast set H4483 (8745) over H5922 the affairs H5673 of the province H4083 of Babylon H0895, Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665; these H0479 men H1400, O king H4430, have H7761 (8754) not H3809 regarded H2942 thee H5922: they serve H6399 (8750) not H3809 thy gods H0426, nor H3809 worship H5457 (8750) the golden H1722 image H6755 which thou hast set up H6966 (8684).
003:013 Then H0116 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 in [his] rage H7266 and fury H2528 commanded H0560 (8754) to bring H0858 (8682) Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665. Then H0116 they brought H0858 (8717) these H0479 men H1400 before H6925 the king H4430.
003:014 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 spake H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750) unto them, [Is it] true H6656, O Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, do not H3809 ye H0383 serve H6399 (8750) my gods H0426, nor H3809 worship H5457 (8750) the golden H1722 image H6755 which I have set H6966 (8684) up?
003:015 Now H3705 if H2006 ye be H0383 ready H6263 that at what time H5732 ye hear H8086 (8748) the sound H7032 of the cornet H7162, flute H4953, harp H7030 (8675) H7030, sackbut H5443, psaltery H6460, and dulcimer H5481, and all H3606 kinds H2178 of musick H2170, ye fall down H5308 (8748) and worship H5457 (8748) the image H6755 which I have made H5648 (8754); [well]: but if H2006 ye worship H5457 (8748) not H3809, ye shall be cast H7412 (8729) the same hour H8160 into the midst H1459 of a burning H3345 (8751) fiery H5135 furnace H0861; and who H4479 [is] that God H0426 that shall deliver H7804 (8755) you out of H4481 my hands H3028?
003:016 Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, answered H6032 (8754) and said H0560 (8750) to the king H4430, O Nebuchadnezzar H5020, we H0586 [are] not H3809 careful H2818 (8750) to answer H8421 (8682) thee in H5922 this H1836 matter H6600.
003:017 If H2006 it be [so], our God H0426 whom we H0586 serve H6399 (8750) is H0383 able H3202 (8750) to deliver H7804 (8756) us from H4481 the burning H3345 (8751) fiery H5135 furnace H0861, and H4481 he will deliver H7804 (8755) [us] out of H4481 thine hand H3028, O king H4430.
003:018 But if H2006 not H3809, be it H1934 (8748) known H3046 (8752) unto thee, O king H4430, that we will H0383 not H3809 serve H6399 (8750) thy gods H0426, nor H3809 worship H5457 (8748) the golden H1722 image H6755 which thou hast set up H6966 (8684).
003:019 Then H0116 was Nebuchadnezzar H5020 full H4391 (8728) of fury H2528, and the form H6755 of his visage H0600 was changed H8133 (8724) against H5922 Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665: [therefore] he spake H6032 (8750), and commanded H0560 (8750) that they should heat H0228 (8749) the furnace H0861 one H2298 seven times H7655 more H5922 than H1768 it was wont H2370 (8752) to be heated H0228 (8749).
003:020 And he commanded H0560 (8754) the most H2429 mighty H1401 men H1400 that [were] in his army H2429 to bind H3729 (8742) Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, [and] to cast H7412 (8749) [them] into the burning H3345 (8751) fiery H5135 furnace H0861.
003:021 Then H0116 these H0479 men H1400 were bound H3729 (8760) in their coats H5622, their hosen H6361 (8675) H6361, and their hats H3737, and their [other] garments H3831, and were cast H7412 (8752) into the midst H1459 of the burning H3345 (8751) fiery H5135 furnace H0861.
003:022 Therefore H3606 H6903 because H4481 H1836 the king’s H4430 commandment H4406 was urgent H2685 (8683), and the furnace H0861 exceeding H3493 hot H0228 (8752), the flame H7631 of the fire H5135 slew H6992 (8745) those H0479 men H1400 H1994 that took up H5267 (8684) Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665.
003:023 And these H0479 three H8532 men H1400, Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, fell down H5308 (8754) bound H3729 (8743) into the midst H1459 of the burning H3345 (8751) fiery H5135 furnace H0861.
003:024 Then H0116 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 the king H4430 was astonied H8429 (8754), and rose up H6966 (8754) in haste H0927 (8726), [and] spake H6032 (8750), and said H0560 (8750) unto his counsellors H1907, Did not H3809 we cast H7412 (8754) three H8532 men H1400 bound H3729 (8743) into the midst H1459 of the fire H5135? They answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750) unto the king H4430, True H3330, O king H4430.
003:025 He answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750), Lo H1888, I H0576 see H2370 (8751) four H0703 men H1400 loose H8271 (8750), walking H1981 (8683) in the midst H1459 of the fire H5135, and they have H0383 no H3809 hurt H2257; and the form H7299 of the fourth H7244 is like H1821 (8751) the Son H1247 of God H0426.
003:026 Then H0116 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 came near H7127 (8754) to the mouth H8651 of the burning H3345 (8751) fiery H5135 furnace H0861, [and] spake H6032 (8750), and said H0560 (8750), Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, ye servants H5649 of the most high H5943 God H0426, come forth H5312 (8747), and come H0858 (8747) [hither]. Then H0116 Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, came forth H5312 (8750) of H4481 the midst H1459 of the fire H5135.
003:027 And the princes H0324, governors H5460, and captains H6347, and the king’s H4430 counsellors H1907, being gathered together H3673 (8723), saw H2370 (8751) these H0479 men H1400, upon whose bodies H1655 the fire H5135 had no H3809 power H7981 (8754), nor H3809 was an hair H8177 of their head H7217 singed H2761 (8724), neither H3809 were their coats H5622 changed H8133 (8754), nor H3809 the smell H7382 of fire H5135 had passed H5709 (8754) on them.
003:028 [Then] Nebuchadnezzar H5020 spake H6032 (8750), and said H0560 (8750), Blessed H1289 (8752) [be] the God H0426 of Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, who hath sent H7972 (8754) his angel H4398, and delivered H7804 (8758) his servants H5649 that trusted H7365 (8702) in him H5922, and have changed H8133 (8745) the king’s H4430 word H4406, and yielded H3052 (8754) their bodies H1655, that they might not H3809 serve H6399 (8748) nor H3809 worship H5457 (8748) any H3606 god H0426, except H3861 their own God H0426.
003:029 Therefore I H4481 make H7761 (8752) a decree H2942, That every H3606 people H5972, nation H0524, and language H3961, which speak H0560 (8748) any thing amiss H7960 (8675) H7955 against H5922 the God H0426 of Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, shall be cut H5648 (8725) in pieces H1917, and their houses H1005 shall be made H7739 (8721) a dunghill H5122: because H6903 H3606 there is H0383 no H3809 other H0321 God H0426 that can H3202 (8748) deliver H5338 (8682) after this H1836 sort.
003:030 Then H0116 the king H4430 promoted H6744 (8684) Shadrach H7715, Meshach H4336, and Abednego H5665, in the province H4083 of Babylon H0895.
004:001 ¶  Nebuchadnezzar H5020 the king H4430, unto all H3606 people H5972, nations H0524, and languages H3961, that dwell H1753 (8748) in all H3606 the earth H0772; Peace H8001 be multiplied H7680 (8748) unto you.
004:002 I thought H6925 it good H8232 (8754) to shew H2324 (8682) the signs H0852 and wonders H8540 that the high H5943 God H0426 hath wrought H5648 (8754) toward H5974 me.
004:003 How H4101 great H7260 [are] his signs H0852! and how H4101 mighty H8624 [are] his wonders H8540! his kingdom H4437 [is] an everlasting H5957 kingdom H4437, and his dominion H7985 [is] from H5974 generation H1859 to generation H1859.
004:004 I H0576 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 was H1934 (8754) at rest H7954 (8752) in mine house H1005, and flourishing H7487 in my palace H1965:
004:005 I saw H2370 (8754) a dream H2493 which made me afraid H1763 (8741), and the thoughts H2031 upon H5922 my bed H4903 and the visions H2376 of my head H7217 troubled H0927 (8792) me.
004:006 Therefore H4481 made H7761 (8752) I H4481 a decree H2942 to bring H5954 (8682) in all H3606 the wise H2445 [men] of Babylon H0895 before H6925 me, that they might make known H3046 (8681) unto me the interpretation H6591 of the dream H2493.
004:007 Then H0116 came H5954 (8750) in the magicians H2749, the astrologers H0826, the Chaldeans H3779, and the soothsayers H1505 (8750): and I H0576 told H0560 (8750) the dream H2493 before H6925 them; but they did not H3809 make known H3046 (8683) unto me the interpretation H6591 thereof.
004:008 But at H5705 the last H0318 Daniel H1841 came in H5922 before me H6925, whose name H8036 [was] Belteshazzar H1096, according to the name H8036 of my god H0426, and in whom [is] the spirit H7308 of the holy H6922 gods H0426: and before H6925 him I told H0560 (8754) the dream H2493, [saying],
004:009 O Belteshazzar H1096, master H7229 of the magicians H2749, because I H0576 know H3046 (8754) that the spirit H7308 of the holy H6922 gods H0426 [is] in thee, and no H3606 H3809 secret H7328 troubleth H0598 (8750) thee, tell H0560 (8747) me the visions H2376 of my dream H2493 that I have seen H2370 (8754), and the interpretation H6591 thereof.
004:010 Thus [were] the visions H2376 of mine head H7217 in H5922 my bed H4903; I saw H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751), and behold H0431 a tree H0363 in the midst H1459 of the earth H0772, and the height H7314 thereof [was] great H7690.
004:011 The tree H0363 grew H7236 (8754), and was strong H8631 (8754), and the height H7314 thereof reached H4291 (8748) unto heaven H8065, and the sight H2379 thereof to the end H5491 of all H3606 the earth H0772:
004:012 The leaves H6074 thereof [were] fair H8209, and the fruit H0004 thereof much H7690, and in it [was] meat H4203 for all H3606: the beasts H2423 of the field H1251 had shadow H2927 (8681) under H8460 it, and the fowls H6853 of the heaven H8065 dwelt H1753 (8748) in the boughs H6056 thereof, and all H3606 flesh H1321 was fed H2110 (8729) of it H4481.
004:013 I saw H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751) in the visions H2376 of my head H7217 upon H5922 my bed H4903, and, behold H0431, a watcher H5894 and an holy one H6922 came down H5182 (8750) from H4481 heaven H8065;
004:014 He cried H7123 (8751) aloud H2429, and said H0560 (8750) thus H3652, Hew down H1414 the tree H0363, and cut off H7113 (8745) his branches H6056, shake off H5426 (8680) his leaves H6074, and scatter H0921 (8745) his fruit H0004: let the beasts H2423 get away H5111 (8748) from H4481 under it H8479, and the fowls H6853 from H4481 his branches H6056:
004:015 Nevertheless H1297 leave H7662 (8747) the stump H6136 of his roots H8330 in the earth H0772, even with a band H0613 of iron H6523 and brass H5174, in the tender grass H1883 of the field H1251; and let it be wet H6647 (8721) with the dew H2920 of heaven H8065, and [let] his portion H2508 [be] with H5974 the beasts H2423 in the grass H6211 of the earth H0772:
004:016 Let his heart H3825 be changed H8133 (8741) from H4481 man’s H0606, and let a beast’s H2423 heart H3825 be given H3052 (8725) unto him; and let seven H7655 times H5732 pass H2499 over H5922 him.
004:017 This matter H6600 [is] by the decree H1510 of the watchers H5894, and the demand H7595 by the word H3983 of the holy ones H6922: to H5705 the intent H1701 that the living H2417 may know H3046 (8748) that the most High H5943 ruleth H7990 in the kingdom H4437 of men H0606, and giveth H5415 (8748) it to whomsoever H4479 he will H6634 (8748), and setteth up H6966 (8681) over H5922 it the basest H8215 of men H0606.
004:018 This H1836 dream H2493 I H0576 king H4430 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 have seen H2370 (8754). Now thou H0607, O Belteshazzar H1096, declare H0560 (8747) the interpretation H6591 thereof, forasmuch as H6903 all H3606 the wise H2445 [men] of my kingdom H4437 are not H3809 able H3202 (8750) to make known H3046 (8682) unto me the interpretation H6591: but thou H0607 [art] able H3546 (8751); for the spirit H7308 of the holy H6922 gods H0426 [is] in thee.
004:019 Then H0116 Daniel H1841, whose name H8036 [was] Belteshazzar H1096, was astonied H8075 (8733) for one H2298 hour H8160, and his thoughts H7476 troubled H0927 (8792) him. The king H4430 spake H6032 (8750), and said H0560 (8750), Belteshazzar H1096, let not H0409 the dream H2493, or the interpretation H6591 thereof, trouble H0927 (8792) thee. Belteshazzar H1096 answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750), My lord H4756, the dream H2493 [be] to them that hate H8131 (8750) thee, and the interpretation H6591 thereof to thine enemies H6146.
004:020 The tree H0363 that thou sawest H2370 (8754), which grew H7236 (8754), and was strong H8631 (8754), whose height H7314 reached H4291 (8748) unto the heaven H8065, and the sight H2379 thereof to all H3606 the earth H0772;
004:021 Whose leaves H6074 [were] fair H8209, and the fruit H0004 thereof much H7690, and in it [was] meat H4203 for all H3606; under H8460 which the beasts H2423 of the field H1251 dwelt H1753 (8748), and upon whose branches H6056 the fowls H6853 of the heaven H8065 had their habitation H7932 (8748):
004:022 It [is] thou H0607, O king H4430, that art grown H7236 (8754) and become strong H8631 (8748): for thy greatness H7238 is grown H7236 (8754), and reacheth H4291 (8754) unto heaven H8065, and thy dominion H7985 to the end H5491 of the earth H0772.
004:023 And whereas the king H4430 saw H2370 (8754) a watcher H5894 and an holy one H6922 coming down H5182 (8750) from H4481 heaven H8065, and saying H0560 (8750), Hew H1414 the tree H0363 down H1414, and destroy H2255 (8740) it; yet H1297 leave H7662 (8747) the stump H6136 of the roots H8330 thereof in the earth H0772, even with a band H0613 of iron H6523 and brass H5174, in the tender grass H1883 of the field H1251; and let it be wet H6647 (8721) with the dew H2920 of heaven H8065, and [let] his portion H2508 [be] with H5974 the beasts H2423 of the field H1251, till H5705 seven H7655 times H5732 pass H2499 over H5922 him;
004:024 This H1836 [is] the interpretation H6591, O king H4430, and this H1932 [is] the decree H1510 of the most High H5943, which is come H4291 (8754) upon H5922 my lord H4756 the king H4430:
004:025 That they shall drive H2957 (8751) thee from H4481 men H0606, and thy dwelling H4070 shall be H1934 (8748) with H5974 the beasts H2423 of the field H1251, and they shall make thee to eat H2939 (8748) grass H6211 as oxen H8450, and they shall wet H6647 (8743) thee with the dew H2920 of heaven H8065, and seven H7655 times H5732 shall pass H2499 over H5922 thee, till H5705 thou know H3046 (8748) that the most High H5943 ruleth H7990 in the kingdom H4437 of men H0606, and giveth H5415 (8748) it to whomsoever H4479 he will H6634 (8748).
004:026 And whereas they commanded H0560 (8754) to leave H7662 (8749) the stump H6136 of the tree H0363 roots H8330; thy kingdom H4437 shall be sure H7011 unto thee, after H4481 that thou shalt have known H3046 (8748) that the heavens H8065 do rule H7990.
004:027 Wherefore H3861, O king H4430, let my counsel H4431 be acceptable H8232 (8748) unto thee H5922, and break off H6562 (8747) thy sins H2408 by righteousness H6665, and thine iniquities H5758 by shewing mercy H2604 (8749) to the poor H6033 (8750); if H2006 it may be H1934 (8748) a lengthening H0754 of thy tranquillity H7963.
004:028 All H3606 this came H4291 (8754) upon H5922 the king H4430 Nebuchadnezzar H5020.
004:029 At the end H7118 of twelve H8648 H6236 months H3393 he walked H1934 (8754) H1981 (8750) in H5922 the palace H1965 of the kingdom H4437 of Babylon H0895.
004:030 The king H4430 spake H6032 (8750), and said H0560 (8750), Is not H3809 this H1932 H1668 great H7229 Babylon H0895, that I H0576 have built H1124 (8754) for the house H1005 of the kingdom H4437 by the might H8632 of my power H2632, and for the honour H3367 of my majesty H1923?
004:031 While H5751 the word H4406 [was] in the king’s H4430 mouth H6433, there fell H5308 (8754) a voice H7032 from H4481 heaven H8065, [saying], O king H4430 Nebuchadnezzar H5020, to thee it is spoken H0560 (8750); The kingdom H4437 is departed H5709 (8754) from H4481 thee.
004:032 And they shall drive H2957 (8751) thee from H4481 men H0606, and thy dwelling H4070 [shall be] with H5974 the beasts H2423 of the field H1251: they shall make thee to eat H2939 (8748) grass H6211 as oxen H8450, and seven H7655 times H5732 shall pass H2499 over H5922 thee, until H5705 thou know H3046 (8748) that the most High H5943 ruleth H7990 in the kingdom H4437 of men H0606, and giveth H5415 (8748) it to whomsoever H4479 he will H6634 (8748).
004:033 The same hour H8160 was the thing H4406 fulfilled H5487 (8754) upon H5922 Nebuchadnezzar H5020: and he was driven H2957 (8752) from H4481 men H0606, and did eat H0399 (8748) grass H6211 as oxen H8450, and his body H1655 was wet H6647 (8721) with the dew H2920 of heaven H8065, till H5705 his hairs H8177 were grown H7236 (8754) like eagles H5403 ’ [feathers], and his nails H2953 like birds H6853 ’ [claws].
004:034 And at the end H7118 of the days H3118 I H0576 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 lifted up H5191 (8754) mine eyes H5870 unto heaven H8065, and mine understanding H4486 returned H8421 (8748) unto me H5922, and I blessed H1289 (8745) the most High H5943, and I praised H7624 (8745) and honoured H1922 (8745) him that liveth H2417 for ever H5957, whose dominion H7985 [is] an everlasting H5957 dominion H7985, and his kingdom H4437 [is] from H5974 generation H1859 to generation H1859:
004:035 And all H3606 the inhabitants H1753 (8748) of the earth H0772 [are] reputed H2804 (8752) as nothing H3809: and he doeth H5648 (8751) according to his will H6634 (8749) in the army H2429 of heaven H8065, and [among] the inhabitants H1753 (8748) of the earth H0772: and none H3809 can H0383 stay H4223 (8741) his hand H3028, or say H0560 (8748) unto him, What H4101 doest H5648 (8754) thou?
004:036 At the same time H2166 my reason H4486 returned H8421 (8748) unto me H5922; and for the glory H3367 of my kingdom H4437, mine honour H1923 and brightness H2122 returned H8421 (8748) unto me H5922; and my counsellors H1907 and my lords H7261 sought H1156 (8748) unto me H5922; and I was established H8627 (8717) in my kingdom H4437, and excellent H3493 majesty H7238 was added H3255 (8717) unto me.
004:037 Now H3705 I H0576 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 praise H7624 (8743) and extol H7313 (8751) and honour H1922 (8743) the King H4430 of heaven H8065, all H3606 whose works H4567 [are] truth H7187, and his ways H0735 judgment H1780: and those that walk H1981 (8683) in pride H1467 he is able H3202 (8750) to abase H8214 (8682).
005:001 ¶  Belshazzar H1113 the king H4430 made H5648 (8754) a great H7229 feast H3900 to a thousand H0506 of his lords H7261, and drank H8355 (8750) wine H2562 before H6903 the thousand H0506.
005:002 Belshazzar H1113, whiles he tasted H2942 the wine H2562, commanded H0560 (8754) to bring H0858 (8682) the golden H1722 and silver H3702 vessels H3984 which his father H0002 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 had taken H5312 (8684) out of H4481 the temple H1965 which [was] in Jerusalem H3390; that the king H4430, and his princes H7261, his wives H7695, and his concubines H3904, might drink H8355 (8748) therein.
005:003 Then H0116 they brought H0858 (8684) the golden H1722 vessels H3984 that were taken H5312 (8684) out of H4481 the temple H1965 of the house H1005 of God H0426 which [was] at Jerusalem H3390; and the king H4430, and his princes H7261, his wives H7695, and his concubines H3904, drank H8355 (8754) in them.
005:004 They drank H8355 (8754) wine H2562, and praised H7624 (8745) the gods H0426 of gold H1722, and of silver H3702, of brass H5174, of iron H6523, of wood H0636, and of stone H0069.
005:005 In the same hour H8160 came forth H5312 (8754) fingers H0677 of a man’s H0606 hand H3028, and wrote H3790 (8751) over against H6903 the candlestick H5043 upon H5922 the plaister H1528 of the wall H3797 of the king’s H4430 palace H1965: and the king H4430 saw H2370 (8751) the part H6447 of the hand H3028 that wrote H3790 (8751).
005:006 Then H0116 the king’s H4430 countenance H2122 was changed H8133 (8754), and his thoughts H7476 troubled H0927 (8792) him, so that the joints H7001 of his loins H2783 were loosed H8271 (8723), and his knees H0755 smote H5368 (8750) one H1668 against another H1668.
005:007 The king H4430 cried H7123 (8748) aloud H2429 to bring H5954 (8682) in the astrologers H0826, the Chaldeans H3779, and the soothsayers H1505 (8750). [And] the king H4430 spake H6032 (8750), and said H0560 (8750) to the wise H2445 [men] of Babylon H0895, Whosoever H0606 H3606 shall read H7123 (8751) this H1836 writing H3792, and shew H2324 (8741) me the interpretation H6591 thereof, shall be clothed H3848 (8748) with scarlet H0711, and [have] a chain H2002 of gold H1722 about H5922 his neck H6676, and shall be the third H8523 ruler H7981 (8748) in the kingdom H4437.
005:008 Then H0116 came H5954 (8750) in all H3606 the king’s H4430 wise H2445 [men]: but they could H3546 (8751) not H3809 read H7123 (8749) the writing H3792, nor make known H3046 (8682) to the king H4430 the interpretation H6591 thereof.
005:009 Then H0116 was king H4430 Belshazzar H1113 greatly H7690 troubled H0927 (8727), and his countenance H2122 was changed H8133 (8750) in him H5922, and his lords H7261 were astonied H7672 (8723).
005:010 [Now] the queen H4433, by reason H6903 of the words H4406 of the king H4430 and his lords H7261, came H5954 (8754) into the banquet H4961 house H1005: [and] the queen H4433 spake H6032 (8754) and said H0560 (8754), O king H4430, live H2418 (8747) for ever H5957: let not H0409 thy thoughts H7476 trouble H0927 (8792) thee, nor let thy countenance H2122 be changed H8133 (8721):
005:011 There is H0383 a man H1400 in thy kingdom H4437, in whom [is] the spirit H7308 of the holy H6922 gods H0426; and in the days H3118 of thy father H0002 light H5094 and understanding H7924 and wisdom H2452, like the wisdom H2452 of the gods H0426, was found H7912 (8728) in him; whom the king H4430 Nebuchadnezzar H5020 thy father H0002, the king H4430, [I say], thy father H0002, made H6966 (8684) master H7229 of the magicians H2749, astrologers H0826, Chaldeans H3779, [and] soothsayers H1505 (8750);
005:012 Forasmuch as H6903 H3606 an excellent H3493 spirit H7308, and knowledge H4486, and understanding H7924, interpreting H6590 (8743) of dreams H2493, and shewing H0263 of hard sentences H0280, and dissolving H8271 (8743) of doubts H7001, were found H7912 (8728) in the same Daniel H1841, whom the king H4430 named H7761 (8754) H8036 Belteshazzar H1096: now H3705 let Daniel H1841 be called H7123 (8729), and he will shew H2324 (8681) the interpretation H6591.
005:013 Then H0116 was Daniel H1841 brought in H5954 (8717) before H6925 the king H4430. [And] the king H4430 spake H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750) unto Daniel H1841, [Art] thou H0607 that Daniel H1841, which [art] of H4481 the children H1123 of the captivity H1547 of Judah H3061, whom the king H4430 my father H0002 brought H0858 (8684) out of H4481 Jewry H3061?
005:014 I have even heard H8086 (8754) of thee, that the spirit H7308 of the gods H0426 [is] in thee H5922, and [that] light H5094 and understanding H7924 and excellent H3493 wisdom H2452 is found H7912 (8728) in thee.
005:015 And now H3705 the wise H2445 [men], the astrologers H0826, have been brought H5954 (8717) in before H6925 me, that they should read H7123 (8748) this H1836 writing H3792, and make known H3046 (8682) unto me the interpretation H6591 thereof: but they could H3546 (8751) not H3809 shew H2324 (8682) the interpretation H6591 of the thing H4406:
005:016 And I H0576 have heard H8086 (8754) of thee H5922, that thou canst H3202 (8748) make H6590 (8749) interpretations H6591, and dissolve H8271 (8749) doubts H7001: now H3705 if H2006 thou canst H3202 (8748) read H7123 (8749) the writing H3792, and make known H3046 (8682) to me the interpretation H6591 thereof, thou shalt be clothed H3848 (8748) with scarlet H0711, and [have] a chain H2002 of gold H1722 about H5922 thy neck H6676, and shalt be the third H8531 ruler H7981 (8748) in the kingdom H4437.
005:017 Then H0116 Daniel H1841 answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750) before H6925 the king H4430, Let thy gifts H4978 be H1934 (8748) to thyself, and give H3052 (8747) thy rewards H5023 to another H0321; yet H1297 I will read H7123 (8748) the writing H3792 unto the king H4430, and make known H3046 (8681) to him the interpretation H6591.
005:018 O thou H0607 king H4430, the most high H5943 God H0426 gave H3052 (8754) Nebuchadnezzar H5020 thy father H0002 a kingdom H4437, and majesty H7238, and glory H3367, and honour H1923:
005:019 And for H4481 the majesty H7238 that he gave H3052 (8754) him, all H3606 people H5972, nations H0524, and languages H3961, trembled H1934 (8754) H2112 and feared H1763 (8751) before H4481 him H6925: whom he would H1934 (8754) H6634 (8750) he slew H1934 (8754) H6992 (8751); and whom he would H1934 (8754) H6634 (8750) he kept alive H1934 (8754) H2418 (8683); and whom he would H1934 (8754) H6634 (8750) he set up H1934 (8754) H7313 (8683); and whom he would H1934 (8754) H6634 (8750) he put down H1934 (8754) H8214 (8683).
005:020 But when his heart H3825 was lifted up H7313 (8752), and his mind H7308 hardened H8631 (8748) in pride H2103 (8682), he was deposed H5182 (8717) from H4481 his kingly H4437 throne H3764, and they took H5709 (8684) his glory H3367 from him H4481:
005:021 And he was driven H2957 (8752) from H4481 the sons H1123 of men H0606; and his heart H3825 was made H7739 (8745) like H5974 the beasts H2423, and his dwelling H4070 [was] with the wild asses H6167: they fed H2939 (8748) him with grass H6211 like oxen H8450, and his body H1655 was wet H6647 (8721) with the dew H2920 of heaven H8065; till H5705 he knew H3046 (8754) that the most high H5943 God H0426 ruled H7990 in the kingdom H4437 of men H0606, and [that] he appointeth H6966 (8681) over H5922 it whomsoever H4479 he will H6634 (8748).
005:022 And thou H0607 his son H1247, O Belshazzar H1113, hast not H3809 humbled H8214 (8684) thine heart H3825, though H6903 thou knewest H3046 (8754) all H3606 this H1836;
005:023 But hast lifted up H7313 (8712) thyself against H5922 the Lord H4756 of heaven H8065; and they have brought H0858 (8684) the vessels H3984 of his house H1005 before H6925 thee, and thou H0607, and thy lords H7261, thy wives H7695, and thy concubines H3904, have drunk H8355 (8750) wine H2562 in them; and thou hast praised H7624 (8745) the gods H0426 of silver H3702, and gold H1722, of brass H5174, iron H6523, wood H0636, and stone H0069, which see H2370 (8751) not H3809, nor H3809 hear H8086 (8750), nor H3809 know H3046 (8751): and the God H0426 in whose hand H3028 thy breath H5396 [is], and whose [are] all H3606 thy ways H0735, hast thou not H3809 glorified H1922 (8745):
005:024 Then H0116 was the part H6447 of the hand H3028 sent H7972 (8750) from H4481 him H6925; and this H1836 writing H3792 was written H7560 (8752).
005:025 And this H1836 [is] the writing H3792 that was written H7560 (8752), MENE H4484 (8752), MENE H4484 (8752), TEKEL H8625 (8752), UPHARSIN H6537 (8751).
005:026 This H1836 [is] the interpretation H6591 of the thing H4406: MENE H4484 (8752); God H0426 hath numbered H4483 (8754) thy kingdom H4437, and finished H8000 (8684) it.
005:027 TEKEL H8625 (8752); Thou art weighed H8625 (8760) in the balances H3977, and art found H7912 (8728) wanting H2627.
005:028 PERES H6537 (8752); Thy kingdom H4437 is divided H6537 (8752), and given H3052 (8753) to the Medes H4076 and Persians H6540.
005:029 Then H0116 commanded H0560 (8754) Belshazzar H1113, and they clothed H3848 (8684) Daniel H1841 with scarlet H0711, and [put] a chain H2002 of gold H1722 about H5922 his neck H6676, and made a proclamation H3745 (8684) concerning H5922 him, that he should be H1934 (8748) the third H8531 ruler H7990 in the kingdom H4437.
005:030 In that night H3916 was Belshazzar H1113 the king H4430 of the Chaldeans H3779 slain H6992 (8752).
005:031 And Darius H1868 the Median H4077 took H6902 (8745) the kingdom H4437, [being] about threescore H8361 and two H8648 years H8140 old H1247.
006:001 ¶  It pleased H6925 H8232 (8754) Darius H1868 to set H6966 (8684) over H5922 the kingdom H4437 an hundred H3969 and twenty H6243 princes H0324, which should be H1934 (8748) over the whole H3606 kingdom H4437;
006:002 And over H5924 these H4481 three H8532 presidents H5632; of whom H4481 Daniel H1841 [was] first H2298: that H0459 the princes H0324 might H1934 (8748) give H3052 (8751) accounts H2941 unto them, and the king H4430 should have H1934 (8748) no H3809 damage H5142 (8752).
006:003 Then H0116 this H1836 Daniel H1841 was H1934 (8754) preferred H5330 (8723) above H5922 the presidents H5632 and princes H0324, because H3606 H6903 an excellent H3493 spirit H7308 [was] in him; and the king H4430 thought H6246 (8754) to set H6966 (8682) him over H5922 the whole H3606 realm H4437.
006:004 Then H0116 the presidents H5632 and princes H0324 sought H1934 (8754) H1156 (8750) to find H7912 (8682) occasion H5931 against Daniel H1841 concerning H6655 the kingdom H4437; but H3606 they could H3202 (8750) find H7912 (8682) none H3809 occasion H5931 nor H3809 fault H7844 (8752); forasmuch H6903 as he [was] faithful H0540 (8683), neither H3809 was there any H3606 error H7960 or fault H7844 (8752) found H7912 (8728) in him H5922.
006:005 Then H0116 said H0560 (8750) these H0479 men H1400, We shall not H3809 find H7912 (8684) any H3606 occasion H5931 against H5922 this H1836 Daniel H1841, except H3861 we find H7912 (8681) [it] against him concerning the law H1882 of his God H0426.
006:006 Then H0116 these H0459 presidents H5632 and princes H0324 assembled together H7284 (8684) to the king H4430, and said H0560 (8750) thus H3652 unto him H5922, King H4430 Darius H1868, live H2418 (8747) for ever H5957.
006:007 All H3606 the presidents H5632 of the kingdom H4437, the governors H5460, and the princes H0324, the counsellors H1907, and the captains H6347, have consulted together H3272 (8724) to establish H6966 (8742) a royal H4430 statute H7010, and to make a firm H8631 (8742) decree H0633, that whosoever shall ask H1156 (8748) a petition H1159 of H4481 any H3606 God H0426 or man H0606 for H5705 thirty H8533 days H3118, save H3861 of thee H4481, O king H4430, he shall be cast H7412 (8729) into the den H1358 of lions H0744.
006:008 Now H3705, O king H4430, establish H6966 (8681) the decree H0633, and sign H7560 (8748) the writing H3792, that it be not H3809 changed H8133 (8682), according to the law H1882 of the Medes H4076 and Persians H6540, which altereth H5709 (8748) not H3809.
006:009 Wherefore H3606 H1836 H6903 king H4430 Darius H1868 signed H7560 (8754) the writing H3792 and the decree H0633.
006:010 Now when Daniel H1841 knew H3046 (8754) that the writing H3792 was signed H7560 (8752), he went H5954 (8754) into his house H1005; and his windows H3551 being open H6606 (8759) in his chamber H5952 toward H5049 Jerusalem H3390, he kneeled H1289 (8750) upon H5922 his knees H1291 three H8532 times H2166 a day H3118, and prayed H6739 (8743), and gave thanks H3029 (8683) before H6925 his God H0426, as H6903 H3606 he did H1934 (8754) H5648 (8751) aforetime H4481 H1836 H6928.
006:011 Then H0116 these H0479 men H1400 assembled H7284 (8684), and found H7912 (8684) Daniel H1841 praying H1156 (8750) and making supplication H2604 (8723) before H6925 his God H0426.
006:012 Then H0116 they came near H7127 (8754), and spake H0560 (8750) before H6925 the king H4430 concerning H5922 the king’s H4430 decree H0633; Hast thou not H3809 signed H7560 (8754) a decree H0633, that every H3606 man H0606 that shall ask H1156 (8748) [a petition] of H4481 any H3606 God H0426 or man H0606 within H5705 thirty H8533 days H3118, save H3861 of thee H4481, O king H4430, shall be cast H7412 (8729) into the den H1358 of lions H0744? The king H4430 answered H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750), The thing H4406 [is] true H3330, according to the law H1882 of the Medes H4076 and Persians H6540, which altereth H5709 (8748) not H3809.
006:013 Then H0116 answered H6032 (8754) they and said H0560 (8750) before H6925 the king H4430, That Daniel H1841, which [is] of H4481 the children H1123 of the captivity H1547 of Judah H3061, regardeth H7761 (8754) H2942 not H3809 thee H5922, O king H4430, nor the decree H0633 that thou hast signed H7560 (8754), but maketh H1156 (8750) his petition H1159 three H8532 times H2166 a day H3118.
006:014 Then H0116 the king H4430, when he heard H8086 (8754) [these] words H4406, was sore H7690 displeased H0888 (8754) with himself, and set H7761 (8754) [his] heart H1079 on H5922 Daniel H1841 to deliver H7804 (8756) him: and he laboured H1934 (8754) H7712 (8723) till H5705 the going down H4606 of the sun H8122 to deliver H5338 (8682) him.
006:015 Then H0116 these H0479 men H1400 assembled H7284 (8684) unto H5922 the king H4430, and said H0560 (8750) unto the king H4430, Know H3046 (8747), O king H4430, that the law H1882 of the Medes H4076 and Persians H6540 [is], That no H3606 decree H0633 nor statute H7010 which the king H4430 establisheth H6966 (8681) may be changed H8133 (8682).
006:016 Then H0116 the king H4430 commanded H0560 (8754), and they brought H0858 (8684) Daniel H1841, and cast H7412 (8754) [him] into the den H1358 of lions H0744. [Now] the king H4430 spake H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750) unto Daniel H1841, Thy God H0426 whom thou H0607 servest H6399 (8750) continually H8411, he will deliver H7804 (8755) thee.
006:017 And a H2298 stone H0069 was brought H0858 (8717), and laid H7761 (8752) upon H5922 the mouth H6433 of the den H1358; and the king H4430 sealed H2857 (8754) it with his own signet H5824, and with the signet H5824 of his lords H7261; that the purpose H6640 might not H3809 be changed H8133 (8748) concerning Daniel H1841.
006:018 Then H0116 the king H4430 went H0236 (8754) to his palace H1965, and passed the night H0956 (8754) fasting H2908: neither H3809 were instruments H1761 of musick brought H5954 (8684) before H6925 him: and his sleep H8139 went H5075 (8754) from him H5922.
006:019 Then H0116 the king H4430 arose H6966 (8748) very early H8238 in the morning H5053, and went H0236 (8754) in haste H0927 (8726) unto the den H1358 of lions H0744.
006:020 And when he came H7127 (8749) to the den H1358, he cried H2200 (8754) with a lamentable H6088 (8750) voice H7032 unto Daniel H1841: [and] the king H4430 spake H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750) to Daniel H1841, O Daniel H1841, servant H5649 of the living H2417 God H0426, is thy God H0426, whom thou servest H6399 (8750) continually H8411, able H3202 (8754) to deliver H7804 (8756) thee from H4481 the lions H0744?
006:021 Then H0116 said H4449 (8745) Daniel H1841 unto H5974 the king H4430, O king H4430, live H2418 (8747) for ever H5957.
006:022 My God H0426 hath sent H7972 (8754) his angel H4398, and hath shut H5463 (8754) the lions H0744 ’ mouths H6433, that they have not H3809 hurt H2255 (8745) me: forasmuch as H3606 H6903 before H6925 him innocency H2136 was found H7912 (8728) in me; and also H0638 before H6925 thee, O king H4430, have I done H5648 (8754) no H3809 hurt H2248.
006:023 Then H0116 was the king H4430 exceeding H7690 glad H2868 (8754) for him H5922, and commanded H0560 (8754) that they should take H5267 Daniel H1841 up H5267 (8682) out of H4481 the den H1358. So Daniel H1841 was taken up H5267 (8717) out of H4481 the den H1358, and no H3809 manner H3606 of hurt H2257 was found H7912 (8728) upon him, because he believed H0540 (8684) in his God H0426.
006:024 And the king H4430 commanded H0560 (8754), and they brought H0858 (8684) those H0479 men H1400 which had accused H0399 (8754) H7170 Daniel H1841, and they cast H7412 (8754) [them] into the den H1358 of lions H0744, them H0581, their children H1123, and their wives H5389; and the lions H0744 had the mastery H5705 H7981 (8754) of them, and brake H1855 all H3606 their bones H1635 in pieces H1855 (8684) or ever H3809 they came H4291 (8754) at the bottom H0773 of the den H1358.
006:025 Then H0116 king H4430 Darius H1868 wrote H3790 (8754) unto all H3606 people H5972, nations H0524, and languages H3961, that dwell H1753 (8748) in all H3606 the earth H0772; Peace H8001 be multiplied H7680 (8748) unto you.
006:026 I H4481 H6925 make H7761 (8752) a decree H2942, That in every H3606 dominion H7985 of my kingdom H4437 men tremble H1934 (8748) H2112 and fear H1763 (8751) before H4481 H6925 the God H0426 of Daniel H1841: for he [is] the living H2417 God H0426, and stedfast H7011 for ever H5957, and his kingdom H4437 [that] which shall not H3809 be destroyed H2255 (8721), and his dominion H7985 [shall be even] unto H5705 the end H5491.
006:027 He delivereth H7804 (8757) and rescueth H5338 (8683), and he worketh H5648 (8751) signs H0852 and wonders H8540 in heaven H8065 and in earth H0772, who hath delivered H7804 (8758) Daniel H1841 from H4481 the power H3028 of the lions H0744.
006:028 So this H1836 Daniel H1841 prospered H6744 (8684) in the reign H4437 of Darius H1868, and in the reign H4437 of Cyrus H3567 the Persian H6543.
007:001 ¶  In the first H2298 year H8140 of Belshazzar H1113 king H4430 of Babylon H0895 Daniel H1841 had H2370 (8754) a dream H2493 and visions H2376 of his head H7217 upon H5922 his bed H4903: then H0116 he wrote H3790 (8754) the dream H2493, [and] told H0560 (8754) the sum H7217 of the matters H4406.
007:002 Daniel H1841 spake H6032 (8750) and said H0560 (8750), I saw H2370 (8751) H1934 (8754) in my vision H2376 by H5974 night H3916, and, behold H0718, the four H0703 winds H7308 of the heaven H8065 strove H1519 (8683) upon the great H7229 sea H3221.
007:003 And four H0703 great H7260 beasts H2423 came up H5559 (8751) from H4481 the sea H3221, diverse H8133 (8750) one H1668 from H4481 another H1668.
007:004 The first H6933 [was] like a lion H0744, and had eagle’s H5403 wings H1611: I beheld H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751) till H5705 the wings H1611 thereof were plucked H4804 (8760), and it was lifted up H5191 (8760) from H4481 the earth H0772, and made stand H6966 (8717) upon H5922 the feet H7271 as a man H0606, and a man’s H0606 heart H3825 was given H3052 (8753) to it.
007:005 And behold H0718 another H0317 beast H2423, a second H8578, like H1821 (8751) to a bear H1678, and it raised up H6966 (8684) itself on one H2298 side H7859, and [it had] three H8532 ribs H5967 in the mouth H6433 of it between H0997 the teeth H8128 of it: and they said H0560 (8750) thus H3652 unto it, Arise H6966 (8747), devour H0399 (8747) much H7690 flesh H1321.
007:006 After H0870 this H1836 I beheld H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751), and lo H0718 another H0317, like a leopard H5245, which had upon H5922 the back H1355 of it four H0703 wings H1611 of a fowl H5776; the beast H2423 had also four H0703 heads H7217; and dominion H7985 was given H3052 (8753) to it.
007:007 After H0870 this H1836 I saw H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751) in the night H3916 visions H2376, and behold H0718 a fourth H7244 beast H2423, dreadful H1763 (8753) and terrible H0574, and strong H8624 exceedingly H3493; and it had great H7260 iron H6523 teeth H8128: it devoured H0399 (8750) and brake in pieces H1855 (8683), and stamped H7512 (8751) the residue H7606 with the feet H7271 of it: and it H1932 [was] diverse H8133 (8743) from H4481 all H3606 the beasts H2423 that [were] before H6925 it; and it had ten H6236 horns H7162.
007:008 I considered H1934 (8754) H7920 (8723) the horns H7162, and, behold H0431, there came up H5559 (8754) among H0997 them another H0317 little H2192 horn H7162, before H6925 H4481 whom there were three H8532 of H4481 the first H6933 horns H7162 plucked up by the roots H6132 (8725): and, behold H0431, in this H1668 horn H7162 [were] eyes H5870 like the eyes H5870 of man H0606, and a mouth H6433 speaking H4449 (8743) great things H7260.
007:009 I beheld H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751) till H5705 the thrones H3764 were cast down H7412 (8752), and the Ancient H6268 of days H3118 did sit H3488 (8754), whose garment H3831 [was] white H2358 as snow H8517, and the hair H8177 of his head H7217 like the pure H5343 wool H6015: his throne H3764 [was like] the fiery H5135 flame H7631, [and] his wheels H1535 [as] burning H1815 (8751) fire H5135.
007:010 A fiery H5135 stream H5103 issued H5047 (8743) and came forth H5312 (8750) from H4481 before H6925 him: thousand H0506 thousands H0506 ministered H8120 (8741) unto him, and ten thousand H7240 times ten thousand H7240 stood H6966 (8748) before H6925 him: the judgment H1780 was set H3488 (8754), and the books H5609 were opened H6606 (8760).
007:011 I beheld H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751) then H0116 because H4481 of the voice H7032 of the great H7260 words H4406 which the horn H7162 spake H4449 (8743): I beheld H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751) [even] till H5705 the beast H2423 was slain H6992 (8752), and his body H1655 destroyed H0007 (8717), and given H3052 (8753) to the burning H3346 flame H0785.
007:012 As concerning the rest H7606 of the beasts H2423, they had their dominion H7985 taken away H5709 (8684): yet their lives H2417 were prolonged H3052 (8753) for H5705 a season H2166 and time H5732.
007:013 I saw H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751) in the night H3916 visions H2376, and, behold H0718, [one] like the Son H1247 of man H0606 came H0858 (8750) with H5974 the clouds H6050 of heaven H8065, and came H4291 (8754) to H5705 the Ancient H6268 of days H3118, and they brought him near H7127 (8684) before H6925 him.
007:014 And there was given H3052 (8753) him dominion H7985, and glory H3367, and a kingdom H4437, that all H3606 people H5972, nations H0524, and languages H3961, should serve H6399 (8748) him: his dominion H7985 [is] an everlasting H5957 dominion H7985, which shall not H3809 pass away H5709 (8748), and his kingdom H4437 [that] which shall not H3809 be destroyed H2255 (8721).
007:015 I H0576 Daniel H1841 was grieved H3735 (8730) in my spirit H7308 in the midst H1459 of [my] body H5085, and the visions H2376 of my head H7217 troubled H0927 (8792) me.
007:016 I came near H7127 (8754) unto H5922 one H2298 of H4481 them that stood by H6966 (8750), and asked H1156 (8748) him H4481 the truth H3330 of all H3606 this H1836. So he told H0560 (8754) me, and made me know H3046 (8681) the interpretation H6591 of the things H4406.
007:017 These H0459 great H7260 beasts H2423, which H0581 are four H0703, [are] four H0703 kings H4430, [which] shall arise H6966 (8748) out of H4481 the earth H0772.
007:018 But the saints H6922 of the most High H5946 shall take H6902 (8741) the kingdom H4437, and possess H2631 (8681) the kingdom H4437 for H5705 ever H5957, even for H5705 ever H5957 and ever H5957.
007:019 Then H0116 I would H6634 (8754) know the truth H3321 (8742) of H5922 the fourth H7244 beast H2423, which was H1934 (8754) diverse H8133 (8750) from H4481 all H3606 the others, exceeding H3493 dreadful H1763 (8753), whose teeth H8128 [were of] iron H6523, and his nails H2953 [of] brass H5174; [which] devoured H0399 (8750), brake in pieces H1855 (8683), and stamped H7512 (8751) the residue H7606 with his feet H7271;
007:020 And of H5922 the ten H6236 horns H7162 that [were] in his head H7217, and [of] the other H0317 which came up H5559 (8754), and before H4481 H6925 whom three H8532 fell H5308 (8754); even [of] that horn H7162 that H1797 had eyes H5870, and a mouth H6433 that spake H4449 (8743) very great things H7260, whose look H2376 [was] more H4481 stout H7229 than H4481 his fellows H2273.
007:021 I beheld H1934 (8754) H2370 (8751), and the same H1797 horn H7162 made H5648 (8751) war H7129 with H5974 the saints H6922, and prevailed H3202 (8750) against them;
007:022 Until H5705 the Ancient H6268 of days H3118 came H0858 (8754) H1768, and judgment H1780 was given H3052 (8753) to the saints H6922 of the most High H5946; and the time H2166 came H4291 (8754) that the saints H6922 possessed H2631 (8684) the kingdom H4437.
007:023 Thus H3652 he said H0560 (8754), The fourth H7244 beast H2423 shall be H1934 (8748) the fourth H7244 kingdom H4437 upon earth H0772, which shall be diverse H8133 (8748) from H4481 all H3606 kingdoms H4437, and shall devour H0399 (8748) the whole H3606 earth H0772, and shall tread it down H1759 (8748), and break it in pieces H1855 (8681).
007:024 And the ten H6236 horns H7162 out of H4481 this kingdom H4437 [are] ten H6236 kings H4430 [that] shall arise H6966 (8748): and another H0321 shall rise H6966 (8748) after H0311 them; and he shall be diverse H8133 (8748) from H4481 the first H6933, and he shall subdue H8214 (8681) three H8532 kings H4430.
007:025 And he shall speak H4449 (8741) [great] words H4406 against H6655 the most High H5943, and shall wear out H1080 (8741) the saints H6922 of the most High H5946, and think H5452 (8748) to change H8133 (8682) times H2166 and laws H1882: and they shall be given H3052 (8725) into his hand H3028 until H5705 a time H5732 and times H5732 and the dividing H6387 of time H5732.
007:026 But the judgment H1780 shall sit H3488 (8754), and they shall take away H5709 (8681) his dominion H7985, to consume H8046 (8682) and to destroy H0007 (8682) [it] unto H5705 the end H5491.
007:027 And the kingdom H4437 and dominion H7985, and the greatness H7238 of the kingdom H4437 under H8460 the whole H3606 heaven H8065, shall be given H3052 (8753) to the people H5972 of the saints H6922 of the most High H5946, whose kingdom H4437 [is] an everlasting H5957 kingdom H4437, and all H3606 dominions H7985 shall serve H6399 (8748) and obey H8086 (8721) him.
007:028 Hitherto H5705 H3542 [is] the end H5491 of the matter H4406. As for me H0576 Daniel H1841, my cogitations H7476 much H7690 troubled H0927 (8792) me, and my countenance H2122 changed H8133 (8721) in me H5922: but I kept H5202 (8754) the matter H4406 in my heart H3821.
008:001 ¶  In the third H7969 year H8141 of the reign H4438 of king H4428 Belshazzar H1112 a vision H2377 appeared H7200 (8738) unto me, [even unto] me Daniel H1840, after H0310 that which appeared H7200 (8738) unto me at the first H8462.
008:002 And I saw H7200 (8799) in a vision H2377; and it came to pass, when I saw H7200 (8800), that I [was] at Shushan H7800 [in] the palace H1002, which [is] in the province H4082 of Elam H5867; and I saw H7200 (8799) in a vision H2377, and I was by the river H0180 of Ulai H0195.
008:003 Then I lifted up H5375 (8799) mine eyes H5869, and saw H7200 (8799), and, behold, there stood H5975 (8802) before H6440 the river H0180 a H0259 ram H0352 which had [two] horns H7161: and the [two] horns H7161 [were] high H1364; but one H0259 [was] higher H1364 than the other H8145, and the higher H1364 came up H5927 (8802) last H0314.
008:004 I saw H7200 (8804) the ram H0352 pushing H5055 (8764) westward H3220, and northward H6828, and southward H5045; so that no beasts H2416 might stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 him, neither [was there any] that could deliver H5337 (8688) out of his hand H3027; but he did H6213 (8804) according to his will H7522, and became great H1431 (8689).
008:005 And as I was considering H0995 (8688), behold, an he H5795 goat H6842 came H0935 (8802) from the west H4628 on the face H6440 of the whole earth H0776, and touched H5060 (8802) not the ground H0776: and the goat H6842 [had] a notable H2380 horn H7161 between his eyes H5869.
008:006 And he came H0935 (8799) to the ram H0352 that had H1167 [two] horns H7161, which I had seen H7200 (8804) standing H5975 (8802) before H6440 the river H0180, and ran H7323 (8799) unto him in the fury H2534 of his power H3581.
008:007 And I saw H7200 (8804) him come H5060 (8688) close unto H0681 the ram H0352, and he was moved with choler H4843 (8698) against him, and smote H5221 (8686) the ram H0352, and brake H7665 (8762) his two H8147 horns H7161: and there was no power H3581 in the ram H0352 to stand H5975 (8800) before H6440 him, but he cast him down H7993 (8686) to the ground H0776, and stamped H7429 (8799) upon him: and there was none that could deliver H5337 (8688) the ram H0352 out of his hand H3027.
008:008 Therefore the he H6842 goat H5795 waxed very H3966 great H1431 (8689): and when he was strong H6105 (8800), the great H1419 horn H7161 was broken H7665 (8738); and for it came up H5927 (8799) four H0702 notable ones H2380 toward the four H0702 winds H7307 of heaven H8064.
008:009 And out of one H0259 of them came forth H3318 (8804) a little H4704 horn H7161, which waxed exceeding H3499 great H1431 (8799), toward the south H5045, and toward the east H4217, and toward the pleasant H6643 [land].
008:010 And it waxed great H1431 (8799), [even] to the host H6635 of heaven H8064; and it cast down H5307 (8686) [some] of the host H6635 and of the stars H3556 to the ground H0776, and stamped H7429 (8799) upon them.
008:011 Yea, he magnified H1431 (8689) [himself] even to the prince H8269 of the host H6635, and by him the daily H8548 [sacrifice] was taken away H7311 (8717) (8675) H7311 (8689), and the place H4349 of his sanctuary H4720 was cast down H7993 (8717).
008:012 And an host H6635 was given H5414 (8735) [him] against the daily H8548 [sacrifice] by reason of transgression H6588, and it cast down H7993 (8686) the truth H0571 to the ground H0776; and it practised H6213 (8804), and prospered H6743 (8689).
008:013 Then I heard H8085 (8799) one H0259 saint H6918 speaking H1696 (8764), and another H0259 saint H6918 said H0559 (8799) unto that certain H6422 [saint] which spake H1696 (8764), How long [shall be] the vision H2377 [concerning] the daily H8548 [sacrifice], and the transgression H6588 of desolation H8074 (8802), to give H5414 (8800) both the sanctuary H6944 and the host H6635 to be trodden under foot H4823?
008:014 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Unto two thousand H0505 and three H7969 hundred H3967 days H6153 H1242; then shall the sanctuary H6944 be cleansed H6663 (8738).
008:015 And it came to pass, when I, [even] I Daniel H1840, had seen H7200 (8800) the vision H2377, and sought H1245 (8762) for the meaning H0998, then, behold, there stood H5975 (8802) before me as the appearance H4758 of a man H1397.
008:016 And I heard H8085 (8799) a man’s H0120 voice H6963 between [the banks of] Ulai H0195, which called H7121 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), Gabriel H1403, make this H1975 [man] to understand H0995 (8685) the vision H4758.
008:017 So he came H0935 (8799) near H0681 where I stood H5977: and when he came H0935 (8800), I was afraid H1204 (8738), and fell H5307 (8799) upon my face H6440: but he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Understand H0995 (8685), O son H1121 of man H0120: for at the time H6256 of the end H7093 [shall be] the vision H2377.
008:018 Now as he was speaking H1696 (8763) with me, I was in a deep sleep H7290 (8738) on my face H6440 toward the ground H0776: but he touched H5060 (8799) me, and set H5975 (8686) me upright H5977.
008:019 And he said H0559 (8799), Behold, I will make thee know H3045 (8688) what shall be in the last end H0319 of the indignation H2195: for at the time appointed H4150 the end H7093 [shall be].
008:020 The ram H0352 which thou sawest H7200 (8804) having H1167 [two] horns H7161 [are] the kings H4428 of Media H4074 and Persia H6539.
008:021 And the rough H8163 goat H6842 [is] the king H4428 of Grecia H3120: and the great H1419 horn H7161 that [is] between his eyes H5869 [is] the first H7223 king H4428.
008:022 Now that being broken H7665 (8737), whereas four H0702 stood up H5975 (8799) for it, four H0702 kingdoms H4438 shall stand up H5975 (8799) out of the nation H1471, but not in his power H3581.
008:023 And in the latter time H0319 of their kingdom H4438, when the transgressors H6586 (8802) are come to the full H8552 (8687), a king H4428 of fierce H5794 countenance H6440, and understanding H0995 (8688) dark sentences H2420, shall stand up H5975 (8799).
008:024 And his power H3581 shall be mighty H6105 (8804), but not by his own power H3581: and he shall destroy H7843 (8686) wonderfully H6381 (8737), and shall prosper H6743 (8689), and practise H6213 (8804), and shall destroy H7843 (8689) the mighty H6099 and the holy H6918 people H5971.
008:025 And through his policy H7922 also he shall cause craft H4820 to prosper H6743 (8689) in his hand H3027; and he shall magnify H1431 (8686) [himself] in his heart H3824, and by peace H7962 shall destroy H7843 (8686) many H7227: he shall also stand up H5975 (8799) against the Prince H8269 of princes H8269; but he shall be broken H7665 (8735) without H0657 hand H3027.
008:026 And the vision H4758 of the evening H6153 and the morning H1242 which was told H0559 (8738) [is] true H0571: wherefore shut thou up H5640 (8798) the vision H2377; for it [shall be] for many H7227 days H3117.
008:027 And I Daniel H1840 fainted H1961 (8738), and was sick H2470 (8738) [certain] days H3117; afterward I rose up H6965 (8799), and did H6213 (8799) the king’s H4428 business H4399; and I was astonished H8074 (8709) at the vision H4758, but none understood H0995 (8688) [it].
009:001 ¶  In the first H0259 year H8141 of Darius H1867 the son H1121 of Ahasuerus H0325, of the seed H2233 of the Medes H4074, which was made king H4427 (8717) over the realm H4438 of the Chaldeans H3778;
009:002 In the first H0259 year H8141 of his reign H4427 (8800) I Daniel H1840 understood H0995 (8804) by books H5612 the number H4557 of the years H8141, whereof the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to Jeremiah H3414 the prophet H5030, that he would accomplish H4390 (8763) seventy H7657 years H8141 in the desolations H2723 of Jerusalem H3389.
009:003 And I set H5414 (8799) my face H6440 unto the Lord H0136 God H0430, to seek H1245 (8763) by prayer H8605 and supplications H8469, with fasting H6685, and sackcloth H8242, and ashes H0665:
009:004 And I prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068 my God H0430, and made my confession H3034 (8691), and said H0559 (8799), O H0577 Lord H0136, the great H1419 and dreadful H3372 (8737) God H0410, keeping H8104 (8802) the covenant H1285 and mercy H2617 to them that love H0157 (8802) him, and to them that keep H8104 (8802) his commandments H4687;
009:005 We have sinned H2398 (8804), and have committed iniquity H5753 (8804), and have done wickedly H7561 (8689), and have rebelled H4775 (8804), even by departing H5493 (8800) from thy precepts H4687 and from thy judgments H4941:
009:006 Neither have we hearkened H8085 (8804) unto thy servants H5650 the prophets H5030, which spake H1696 (8765) in thy name H8034 to our kings H4428, our princes H8269, and our fathers H0001, and to all the people H5971 of the land H0776.
009:007 O Lord H0136, righteousness H6666 [belongeth] unto thee, but unto us confusion H1322 of faces H6440, as at this day H3117; to the men H0376 of Judah H3063, and to the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, and unto all Israel H3478, [that are] near H7138, and [that are] far off H7350, through all the countries H0776 whither thou hast driven H5080 (8689) them, because of their trespass H4604 that they have trespassed H4603 (8804) against thee.
009:008 O Lord H0136, to us [belongeth] confusion H1322 of face H6440, to our kings H4428, to our princes H8269, and to our fathers H0001, because we have sinned H2398 (8804) against thee.
009:009 To the Lord H0136 our God H0430 [belong] mercies H7356 and forgivenesses H5547, though we have rebelled H4775 (8804) against him;
009:010 Neither have we obeyed H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430, to walk H3212 (8800) in his laws H8451, which he set H5414 (8804) before H6440 us by H3027 his servants H5650 the prophets H5030.
009:011 Yea, all Israel H3478 have transgressed H5674 (8804) thy law H8451, even by departing H5493 (8800), that they might not obey H8085 (8800) thy voice H6963; therefore the curse H0423 is poured H5413 (8799) upon us, and the oath H7621 that [is] written H3789 (8803) in the law H8451 of Moses H4872 the servant H5650 of God H0430, because we have sinned H2398 (8804) against him.
009:012 And he hath confirmed H6965 (8686) his words H1697, which he spake H1696 (8765) against us, and against our judges H8199 (8802) that judged H8199 (8804) us, by bringing H0935 (8687) upon us a great H1419 evil H7451: for under the whole heaven H8064 hath not been done H6213 (8738) as hath been done H6213 (8738) upon Jerusalem H3389.
009:013 As [it is] written H3789 (8803) in the law H8451 of Moses H4872, all this evil H7451 is come H0935 (8804) upon us: yet made we not our prayer H2470 (8765) before H6440 the LORD H3068 our God H0430, that we might turn H7725 (8800) from our iniquities H5771, and understand H7919 (8687) thy truth H0571.
009:014 Therefore hath the LORD H3068 watched H8245 (8799) upon the evil H7451, and brought H0935 (8686) it upon us: for the LORD H3068 our God H0430 [is] righteous H6662 in all his works H4639 which he doeth H6213 (8804): for we obeyed H8085 (8804) not his voice H6963.
009:015 And now, O Lord H0136 our God H0430, that hast brought H3318 thy people H5971 forth H3318 (8689) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 with a mighty H2389 hand H3027, and hast gotten H6213 (8799) thee renown H8034, as at this day H3117; we have sinned H2398 (8804), we have done wickedly H7561 (8804).
009:016 O Lord H0136, according to all thy righteousness H6666, I beseech thee, let thine anger H0639 and thy fury H2534 be turned away H7725 (8799) from thy city H5892 Jerusalem H3389, thy holy H6944 mountain H2022: because for our sins H2399, and for the iniquities H5771 of our fathers H0001, Jerusalem H3389 and thy people H5971 [are become] a reproach H2781 to all [that are] about H5439 us.
009:017 Now therefore, O our God H0430, hear H8085 (8798) the prayer H8605 of thy servant H5650, and his supplications H8469, and cause thy face H6440 to shine H0215 (8685) upon thy sanctuary H4720 that is desolate H8076, for the Lord’s H0136 sake.
009:018 O my God H0430, incline H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241, and hear H8085 (8798); open H6491 (8798) thine eyes H5869, and behold H7200 (8798) our desolations H8074 (8802), and the city H5892 which is called H7121 (8738) by thy name H8034: for we do not present H5307 (8688) our supplications H8469 before H6440 thee for our righteousnesses H6666, but for thy great H7227 mercies H7356.
009:019 O Lord H0136, hear H8085 (8798); O Lord H0136, forgive H5545 (8798); O Lord H0136, hearken H7181 (8685) and do H6213 (8798); defer H0309 (8762) not H0408, for thine own sake, O my God H0430: for thy city H5892 and thy people H5971 are called H7121 (8738) by thy name H8034.
009:020 And whiles I [was] speaking H1696 (8764), and praying H6419 (8693), and confessing H3034 (8693) my sin H2403 and the sin H2403 of my people H5971 Israel H3478, and presenting H5307 (8688) my supplication H8467 before H6440 the LORD H3068 my God H0430 for the holy H6944 mountain H2022 of my God H0430;
009:021 Yea, whiles I [was] speaking H1696 (8764) in prayer H8605, even the man H0376 Gabriel H1403, whom I had seen H7200 (8804) in the vision H2377 at the beginning H8462, being caused to fly H3286 (8716) swiftly H3288, touched H5060 (8802) me about the time H6256 of the evening H6153 oblation H4503.
009:022 And he informed H0995 (8799) [me], and talked H1696 (8762) with me, and said H0559 (8799), O Daniel H1840, I am now come forth H3318 (8804) to give thee skill H7919 (8687) and understanding H0998.
009:023 At the beginning H8462 of thy supplications H8469 the commandment H1697 came forth H3318 (8804), and I am come H0935 (8804) to shew H5046 (8687) [thee]; for thou [art] greatly beloved H2532: therefore understand H0995 (8798) the matter H1697, and consider H0995 (8685) the vision H4758.
009:024 Seventy H7657 weeks H7620 are determined H2852 (8738) upon thy people H5971 and upon thy holy H6944 city H5892, to finish H3607 (8763) the transgression H6588, and to make an end H8552 (8687) (8675) H2856 (8800) of sins H2403, and to make reconciliation H3722 (8763) for iniquity H5771, and to bring in H0935 (8687) everlasting H5769 righteousness H6664, and to seal up H2856 (8800) the vision H2377 and prophecy H5030, and to anoint H4886 (8800) the most H6944 Holy H6944.
009:025 Know H3045 (8799) therefore and understand H7919 (8686), [that] from the going forth H4161 of the commandment H1697 to restore H7725 (8687) and to build H1129 (8800) Jerusalem H3389 unto the Messiah H4899 the Prince H5057 [shall be] seven H7651 weeks H7620, and threescore H8346 and two H8147 weeks H7620: the street H7339 shall be built H1129 (8738) again H7725 (8799), and the wall H2742, even in troublous H6695 times H6256.
009:026 And after H0310 threescore H8346 and two H8147 weeks H7620 shall Messiah H4899 be cut off H3772 (8735), but not for himself: and the people H5971 of the prince H5057 that shall come H0935 (8802) shall destroy H7843 (8686) the city H5892 and the sanctuary H6944; and the end H7093 thereof [shall be] with a flood H7858, and unto the end H7093 of the war H4421 desolations H8074 (8802) are determined H2782 (8737).
009:027 And he shall confirm H1396 (8689) the covenant H1285 with many H7227 for one H0259 week H7620: and in the midst H2677 of the week H7620 he shall cause the sacrifice H2077 and the oblation H4503 to cease H7673 (8686), and for the overspreading H3671 of abominations H8251 he shall make [it] desolate H8074 (8789), even until the consummation H3617, and that determined H2782 (8737) shall be poured H5413 (8799) upon the desolate H8074 (8802).
010:001 ¶  In the third H7969 year H8141 of Cyrus H3566 king H4428 of Persia H6539 a thing H1697 was revealed H1540 (8738) unto Daniel H1840, whose name H8034 was called H7121 (8738) Belteshazzar H1095; and the thing H1697 [was] true H0571, but the time appointed H6635 [was] long H1419: and he understood H0995 (8804) the thing H1697, and had understanding H0998 of the vision H4758.
010:002 In those days H3117 I Daniel H1840 was mourning H0056 (8693) three H7969 full H3117 weeks H7620.
010:003 I ate H0398 (8804) no pleasant H2532 bread H3899, neither came H0935 (8804) flesh H1320 nor wine H3196 in my mouth H6310, neither did I anoint H5480 (8804) myself at all H5480 (8800), till three H7969 whole H3117 weeks H7620 were fulfilled H4390 (8800).
010:004 And in the four H0702 and twentieth H6242 day H3117 of the first H7223 month H2320, as I was by the side H3027 of the great H1419 river H5104, which [is] Hiddekel H2313;
010:005 Then I lifted up H5375 (8799) mine eyes H5869, and looked H7200 (8799), and behold a certain H0259 man H0376 clothed H3847 (8803) in linen H0906, whose loins H4975 [were] girded H2296 (8803) with fine gold H3800 of Uphaz H0210:
010:006 His body H1472 also [was] like the beryl H8658, and his face H6440 as the appearance H4758 of lightning H1300, and his eyes H5869 as lamps H3940 of fire H0784, and his arms H2220 and his feet H4772 like in colour H5869 to polished H7044 brass H5178, and the voice H6963 of his words H1697 like the voice H6963 of a multitude H1995.
010:007 And I Daniel H1840 alone saw H7200 (8804) the vision H4759: for the men H0582 that were with me saw H7200 (8804) not the vision H4759; but H0061 a great H1419 quaking H2731 fell H5307 (8804) upon them, so that they fled H1272 (8799) to hide H2244 (8736) themselves.
010:008 Therefore I was left alone H7604 (8738), and saw H7200 (8799) this great H1419 vision H4759, and there remained H7604 (8738) no strength H3581 in me: for my comeliness H1935 was turned H2015 (8738) in me into corruption H4889, and I retained H6113 (8804) no strength H3581.
010:009 Yet heard H8085 (8799) I the voice H6963 of his words H1697: and when I heard H8085 (8800) the voice H6963 of his words H1697, then was I in a deep sleep H7290 (8737) on my face H6440, and my face H6440 toward the ground H0776.
010:010 And, behold, an hand H3027 touched H5060 (8804) me, which set H5128 (8686) me upon my knees H1290 and [upon] the palms H3709 of my hands H3027.
010:011 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, O Daniel H1840, a man H0376 greatly beloved H2532, understand H0995 (8685) the words H1697 that I speak H1696 (8802) unto thee, and stand H5975 (8798) upright H5977: for unto thee am I now sent H7971 (8795). And when he had spoken H1696 (8763) this word H1697 unto me, I stood H5975 (8804) trembling H7460 (8688).
010:012 Then said H0559 (8799) he unto me, Fear H3372 (8799) not, Daniel H1840: for from the first H7223 day H3117 that thou didst set H5414 (8804) thine heart H3820 to understand H0995 (8687), and to chasten H6031 (8692) thyself before H6440 thy God H0430, thy words H1697 were heard H8085 (8738), and I am come H0935 (8804) for thy words H1697.
010:013 But the prince H8269 of the kingdom H4438 of Persia H6539 withstood H5975 (8802) me one H0259 and twenty H6242 days H3117: but, lo, Michael H4317, one H0259 of the chief H7223 princes H8269, came H0935 (8804) to help H5826 (8800) me; and I remained H3498 (8738) there with H0681 the kings H4428 of Persia H6539.
010:014 Now I am come H0935 (8804) to make thee understand H0995 (8687) what shall befall H7136 (8799) thy people H5971 in the latter H0319 days H3117: for yet the vision H2377 [is] for [many] days H3117.
010:015 And when he had spoken H1696 (8763) such words H1697 unto me, I set H5414 (8804) my face H6440 toward the ground H0776, and I became dumb H0481 (8738).
010:016 And, behold, [one] like the similitude H1823 of the sons H1121 of men H0120 touched H5060 (8802) my lips H8193: then I opened H6605 (8799) my mouth H6310, and spake H1696 (8762), and said H0559 (8799) unto him that stood H5975 (8802) before me, O my lord H0113, by the vision H4759 my sorrows H6735 are turned H2015 (8738) upon me, and I have retained H6113 (8804) no strength H3581.
010:017 For how H1963 can H3201 (8799) the servant H5650 of this my lord H0113 talk H1696 (8763) with this my lord H0113? for as for me, straightway H6258 there remained H5975 (8799) no strength H3581 in me, neither is there breath H5397 left H7604 (8738) in me.
010:018 Then there came again H3254 (8686) and touched H5060 (8799) me [one] like the appearance H4758 of a man H0120, and he strengthened H2388 (8762) me,
010:019 And said H0559 (8799), O man H0376 greatly beloved H2532, fear H3372 (8799) not: peace H7965 [be] unto thee, be strong H2388 (8798), yea, be strong H2388 (8798). And when he had spoken H1696 (8763) unto me, I was strengthened H2388 (8694), and said H0559 (8799), Let my lord H0113 speak H1696 (8762); for thou hast strengthened H2388 (8765) me.
010:020 Then said H0559 (8799) he, Knowest H3045 (8804) thou wherefore I come H0935 (8804) unto thee? and now will I return H7725 (8799) to fight H3898 (8736) with the prince H8269 of Persia H6539: and when I am gone forth H3318 (8802), lo, the prince H8269 of Grecia H3120 shall come H0935 (8804).
010:021 But H0061 I will shew H5046 (8686) thee that which is noted H7559 (8803) in the scripture H3791 of truth H0571: and [there is] none H0259 that holdeth H2388 (8693) with me in these things, but Michael H4317 your prince H8269.
011:001 ¶  Also I in the first H0259 year H8141 of Darius H1867 the Mede H4075, [even] I, stood H5977 to confirm H2388 (8688) and to strengthen H4581 him.
011:002 And now will I shew H5046 (8686) thee the truth H0571. Behold, there shall stand up H5975 (8802) yet three H7969 kings H4428 in Persia H6539; and the fourth H7243 shall be far H6239 richer H6238 (8686) than [they] all H1419: and by his strength H2393 through his riches H6239 he shall stir up H5782 (8686) all against the realm H4438 of Grecia H3120.
011:003 And a mighty H1368 king H4428 shall stand up H5975 (8804), that shall rule H4910 (8804) with great H7227 dominion H4474, and do H6213 (8804) according to his will H7522.
011:004 And when he shall stand up H5975 (8800), his kingdom H4438 shall be broken H7665 (8735), and shall be divided H2673 (8735) toward the four H0702 winds H7307 of heaven H8064; and not to his posterity H0319, nor according to his dominion H4915 which he ruled H4910 (8804): for his kingdom H4438 shall be plucked up H5428 (8735), even for others H0312 beside those.
011:005 And the king H4428 of the south H5045 shall be strong H2388 (8799), and [one] of his princes H8269; and he shall be strong H2388 (8799) above him, and have dominion H4910 (8804); his dominion H4475 [shall be] a great H7227 dominion H4474.
011:006 And in the end H7093 of years H8141 they shall join themselves together H2266 (8691); for the king’s H4428 daughter H1323 of the south H5045 shall come H0935 (8799) to the king H4428 of the north H6828 to make H6213 (8800) an agreement H4339: but she shall not retain H6113 (8799) the power H3581 of the arm H2220; neither shall he stand H5975 (8799), nor his arm H2220: but she shall be given up H5414 (8735), and they that brought H0935 (8688) her, and he that begat H3205 (8802) her, and he that strengthened H2388 (8688) her in [these] times H6256.
011:007 But out of a branch H5342 of her roots H8328 shall [one] stand up H5975 (8804) in his estate H3653, which shall come H0935 (8799) with an army H2428, and shall enter H0935 (8799) into the fortress H4581 of the king H4428 of the north H6828, and shall deal H6213 (8804) against them, and shall prevail H2388 (8689):
011:008 And shall also carry H0935 (8686) captives H7628 into Egypt H4714 their gods H0430, with their princes H5257, [and] with their precious H2532 vessels H3627 of silver H3701 and of gold H2091; and he shall continue H5975 (8799) [more] years H8141 than the king H4428 of the north H6828.
011:009 So the king H4428 of the south H5045 shall come H0935 (8804) into [his] kingdom H4438, and shall return H7725 (8804) into his own land H0127.
011:010 But his sons H1121 shall be stirred up H1624 (8691), and shall assemble H0622 (8804) a multitude H1995 of great H7227 forces H2428: and [one] shall certainly H0935 (8800) come H0935 (8804), and overflow H7857 (8804), and pass through H5674 (8804): then shall he return H7725 (8799), and be stirred up H1624 (8691), [even] to his fortress H4581.
011:011 And the king H4428 of the south H5045 shall be moved with choler H4843 (8698), and shall come forth H3318 (8804) and fight H3898 (8738) with him, [even] with the king H4428 of the north H6828: and he shall set forth H5975 (8689) a great H7227 multitude H1995; but the multitude H1995 shall be given H5414 (8738) into his hand H3027.
011:012 [And] when he hath taken away H5375 (8738) the multitude H1995, his heart H3824 shall be lifted up H7311 (8804) (8675) H7311 (8799); and he shall cast down H5307 (8689) [many] ten thousands H7239: but he shall not be strengthened H5810 (8799) [by it].
011:013 For the king H4428 of the north H6828 shall return H7725 (8804), and shall set forth H5975 (8689) a multitude H1995 greater H7227 than the former H7223, and shall certainly H0935 (8800) come H0935 (8799) after H7093 certain H6256 years H8141 with a great H1419 army H2428 and with much H7227 riches H7399.
011:014 And in those times H6256 there shall many H7227 stand up H5975 (8799) against the king H4428 of the south H5045: also the robbers H1121 H6530 of thy people H5971 shall exalt H5375 (8691) themselves to establish H5975 (8687) the vision H2377; but they shall fall H3782 (8738).
011:015 So the king H4428 of the north H6828 shall come H0935 (8799), and cast up H8210 (8799) a mount H5550, and take H3920 (8804) the most fenced H4013 cities H5892: and the arms H2220 of the south H5045 shall not withstand H5975 (8799), neither his chosen H4005 people H5971, neither [shall there be any] strength H3581 to withstand H5975 (8800).
011:016 But he that cometh H0935 (8802) against him shall do H6213 (8799) according to his own will H7522, and none shall stand H5975 (8802) before H6440 him: and he shall stand H5975 (8799) in the glorious H6643 land H0776, which by his hand H3027 shall be consumed H3617.
011:017 He shall also set H7760 (8799) his face H6440 to enter H0935 (8800) with the strength H8633 of his whole kingdom H4438, and upright ones H3477 with him; thus shall he do H6213 (8804): and he shall give H5414 (8799) him the daughter H1323 of women H0802, corrupting H7843 (8687) her: but she shall not stand H5975 (8799) [on his side], neither be for him.
011:018 After this shall he turn H7760 (8799) (8675) H7725 (8686) his face H6440 unto the isles H0339, and shall take H3920 (8804) many H7227: but a prince H7101 for his own behalf shall cause the reproach H2781 offered by him to cease H7673 (8689); without H1115 his own reproach H2781 he shall cause [it] to turn H7725 (8686) upon him.
011:019 Then he shall turn H7725 (8686) his face H6440 toward the fort H4581 of his own land H0776: but he shall stumble H3782 (8738) and fall H5307 (8804), and not be found H4672 (8735).
011:020 Then shall stand up H5975 (8804) in his estate H3653 a raiser H5674 (8688) of taxes H5065 (8802) [in] the glory H1925 of the kingdom H4438: but within few H0259 days H3117 he shall be destroyed H7665 (8735), neither in anger H0639, nor in battle H4421.
011:021 And in his estate H3653 shall stand up H5975 (8804) a vile person H0959 (8737), to whom they shall not give H5414 (8804) the honour H1935 of the kingdom H4438: but he shall come H0935 (8804) in peaceably H7962, and obtain H2388 (8689) the kingdom H4438 by flatteries H2519.
011:022 And with the arms H2220 of a flood H7858 shall they be overflown H7857 (8735) from before H6440 him, and shall be broken H7665 (8735); yea, also the prince H5057 of the covenant H1285.
011:023 And after the league H2266 (8692) [made] with him he shall work H6213 (8799) deceitfully H4820: for he shall come up H5927 (8804), and shall become strong H6105 (8804) with a small H4592 people H1471.
011:024 He shall enter H0935 (8799) peaceably H7962 even upon the fattest places H4924 of the province H4082; and he shall do H6213 (8804) [that] which his fathers H0001 have not done H6213 (8804), nor his fathers H0001 ’ fathers H0001; he shall scatter H0967 (8799) among them the prey H0961, and spoil H7998, and riches H7399: [yea], and he shall forecast H2803 (8762) his devices H4284 against the strong holds H4013, even for a time H6256.
011:025 And he shall stir up H5782 (8686) his power H3581 and his courage H3824 against the king H4428 of the south H5045 with a great H1419 army H2428; and the king H4428 of the south H5045 shall be stirred up H1624 (8691) to battle H4421 with a very H3966 great H1419 and mighty H6099 army H2428; but he shall not stand H5975 (8799): for they shall forecast H2803 (8799) devices H4284 against him.
011:026 Yea, they that feed H0398 (8802) of the portion of his meat H6598 shall destroy H7665 (8799) him, and his army H2428 shall overflow H7857 (8799): and many H7227 shall fall H5307 (8804) down slain H2491.
011:027 And both H8147 these kings H4428 ’ hearts H3824 [shall be] to do mischief H4827 (8688) H7451, and they shall speak H1696 (8762) lies H3577 at one H0259 table H7979; but it shall not prosper H6743 (8799): for yet the end H7093 [shall be] at the time appointed H4150.
011:028 Then shall he return H7725 (8804) into his land H0776 with great H1419 riches H7399; and his heart H3824 [shall be] against the holy H6944 covenant H1285; and he shall do H6213 (8804) [exploits], and return H7725 (8799) to his own land H0776.
011:029 At the time appointed H4150 he shall return H7725 (8799), and come H0935 (8804) toward the south H5045; but it shall not be as the former H7223, or as the latter H0314.
011:030 For the ships H6716 of Chittim H3794 shall come H0935 (8804) against him: therefore he shall be grieved H3512 (8738), and return H7725 (8804), and have indignation H2194 (8804) against the holy H6944 covenant H1285: so shall he do H6213 (8804); he shall even return H7725 (8804), and have intelligence H0995 (8799) with them that forsake H5800 (8802) the holy H6944 covenant H1285.
011:031 And arms H2220 shall stand H5975 (8799) on his part, and they shall pollute H2490 (8765) the sanctuary H4720 of strength H4581, and shall take away H5493 (8689) the daily H8548 [sacrifice], and they shall place H5414 (8804) the abomination H8251 that maketh desolate H8074 (8789).
011:032 And such as do wickedly H7561 (8688) against the covenant H1285 shall he corrupt H2610 (8686) by flatteries H2514: but the people H5971 that do know H3045 (8802) their God H0430 shall be strong H2388 (8686), and do H6213 (8804) [exploits].
011:033 And they that understand H7919 (8688) among the people H5971 shall instruct H0995 (8799) many H7227: yet they shall fall H3782 (8738) by the sword H2719, and by flame H3852, by captivity H7628, and by spoil H0961, [many] days H3117.
011:034 Now when they shall fall H3782 (8736), they shall be holpen H5826 (8735) with a little H4592 help H5828: but many H7227 shall cleave H3867 (8738) to them with flatteries H2519.
011:035 And [some] of them of understanding H7919 (8688) shall fall H3782 (8735), to try H6884 (8800) them, and to purge H1305 (8763), and to make [them] white H3835 (8687), [even] to the time H6256 of the end H7093: because [it is] yet for a time appointed H4150.
011:036 And the king H4428 shall do H6213 (8804) according to his will H7522; and he shall exalt H7311 (8709) himself, and magnify H1431 (8691) himself above every god H0410, and shall speak H1696 (8762) marvellous things H6381 (8737) against the God H0410 of gods H0410, and shall prosper H6743 (8689) till the indignation H2195 be accomplished H3615 (8804): for that that is determined H2782 (8737) shall be done H6213 (8738).
011:037 Neither shall he regard H0995 (8799) the God H0430 of his fathers H0001, nor the desire H2532 of women H0802, nor regard H0995 (8799) any god H0433: for he shall magnify H1431 (8691) himself above all.
011:038 But in his estate H3653 shall he honour H3513 (8762) the God H0433 of forces H4581: and a god H0433 whom his fathers H0001 knew H3045 (8804) not shall he honour H3513 (8762) with gold H2091, and silver H3701, and with precious H3368 stones H0068, and pleasant things H2532.
011:039 Thus shall he do H6213 (8804) in the most strong H4581 holds H4013 with a strange H5236 god H0433, whom he shall acknowledge H5234 (8686) (8675) H5234 (8689) [and] increase H7235 (8686) with glory H3519: and he shall cause them to rule H4910 (8689) over many H7227, and shall divide H2505 (8762) the land H0127 for gain H4242.
011:040 And at the time H6256 of the end H7093 shall the king H4428 of the south H5045 push H5055 (8691) at him: and the king H4428 of the north H6828 shall come against him like a whirlwind H8175 (8691), with chariots H7393, and with horsemen H6571, and with many H7227 ships H0591; and he shall enter H0935 (8804) into the countries H0776, and shall overflow H7857 (8804) and pass over H5674 (8804).
011:041 He shall enter H0935 (8804) also into the glorious H6643 land H0776, and many H7227 [countries] shall be overthrown H3782 (8735): but these shall escape H4422 (8735) out of his hand H3027, [even] Edom H0123, and Moab H4124, and the chief H7225 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
011:042 He shall stretch forth H7971 (8799) his hand H3027 also upon the countries H0776: and the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 shall not escape H6413.
011:043 But he shall have power H4910 (8804) over the treasures H4362 of gold H2091 and of silver H3701, and over all the precious H2532 things of Egypt H4714: and the Libyans H3864 and the Ethiopians H3569 [shall be] at his steps H4703.
011:044 But tidings H8052 out of the east H4217 and out of the north H6828 shall trouble H0926 (8762) him: therefore he shall go forth H3318 (8804) with great H1419 fury H2534 to destroy H8045 (8687), and utterly to make away H2763 (8687) many H7227.
011:045 And he shall plant H5193 (8799) the tabernacles H0168 of his palace H0643 between the seas H3220 in the glorious H6643 holy H6944 mountain H2022; yet he shall come H0935 (8804) to his end H7093, and none shall help H5826 (8802) him.
012:001 ¶  And at that time H6256 shall Michael H4317 stand up H5975 (8799), the great H1419 prince H8269 which standeth H5975 (8802) for the children H1121 of thy people H5971: and there shall be H1961 (8738) a time H6256 of trouble H6869, such as never was since there was a nation H1471 [even] to that same time H6256: and at that time H6256 thy people H5971 shall be delivered H4422 (8735), every one that shall be found H4672 (8737) written H3789 (8803) in the book H5612.
012:002 And many H7227 of them that sleep H3463 in the dust H6083 of the earth H0127 shall awake H6974 (8686), some to everlasting H5769 life H2416, and some to shame H2781 [and] everlasting H5769 contempt H1860.
012:003 And they that be wise H7919 (8688) shall shine H2094 (8686) as the brightness H2096 of the firmament H7549; and they that turn many H7227 to righteousness H6663 (8688) as the stars H3556 for ever H5769 and ever H5703.
012:004 But thou, O Daniel H1840, shut up H5640 (8798) the words H1697, and seal H2856 (8798) the book H5612, [even] to the time H6256 of the end H7093: many H7227 shall run to and fro H7751 (8787), and knowledge H1847 shall be increased H7235 (8799).
012:005 Then I Daniel H1840 looked H7200 (8804), and, behold, there stood H5975 (8802) other H0312 two H8147, the one H0259 on this side H2008 of the bank H8193 of the river H2975, and the other H0259 on that side of the bank H8193 of the river H2975.
012:006 And [one] said H0559 (8799) to the man H0376 clothed H3847 (8803) in linen H0906, which [was] upon H4605 the waters H4325 of the river H2975, How long [shall it be to] the end H7093 of these wonders H6382?
012:007 And I heard H8085 (8799) the man H0376 clothed H3847 (8803) in linen H0906, which [was] upon H4605 the waters H4325 of the river H2975, when he held up H7311 (8686) his right hand H3225 and his left hand H8040 unto heaven H8064, and sware H7650 (8735) by him that liveth H2416 for ever H5769 that [it shall be] for a time H4150, times H4150, and an half H2677; and when he shall have accomplished H3615 (8763) to scatter H5310 (8763) the power H3027 of the holy H6944 people H5971, all these [things] shall be finished H3615 (8799).
012:008 And I heard H8085 (8804), but I understood H0995 (8799) not: then said H0559 (8799) I, O my Lord H0113, what [shall be] the end H0319 of these [things]?
012:009 And he said H0559 (8799), Go thy way H3212 (8798), Daniel H1840: for the words H1697 [are] closed up H5640 (8803) and sealed H2856 (8803) till the time H6256 of the end H7093.
012:010 Many H7227 shall be purified H1305 (8691), and made white H3835 (8691), and tried H6884 (8735); but the wicked H7563 shall do wickedly H7561 (8689): and none of the wicked H7563 shall understand H0995 (8799); but the wise H7919 (8688) shall understand H0995 (8799).
012:011 And from the time H6256 [that] the daily H8548 [sacrifice] shall be taken away H5493 (8717), and the abomination H8251 that maketh desolate H8074 (8802) set up H5414 (8800), [there shall be] a thousand H0505 two hundred H3967 and ninety H8673 days H3117.
012:012 Blessed H0835 [is] he that waiteth H2442 (8764), and cometh H5060 (8686) to the thousand H0505 three H7969 hundred H3967 and five H2568 and thirty H7970 days H3117.
012:013 But go thou thy way H3212 (8798) till the end H7093 [be]: for thou shalt rest H5117 (8799), and stand H5975 (8799) in thy lot H1486 at the end H7093 of the days H3117.
