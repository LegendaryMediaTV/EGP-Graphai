003:005 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
003:006 Bring H7126 the tribe H4294 of Levi H3878 near H7126 (8685), and present H5975 (8689) them before H6440 Aaron H0175 the priest H3548, that they may minister H8334 (8765) unto him.
003:007 And they shall keep H8104 (8804) his charge H4931, and the charge H4931 of the whole congregation H5712 before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, to do H5647 (8800) the service H5656 of the tabernacle H4908.

003:009 And thou shalt give H5414 (8804) the Levites H3881 unto Aaron H0175 and to his sons H1121: they [are] wholly given H5414 (8803) unto him out of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
003:010 And thou shalt appoint H6485 (8799) Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121, and they shall wait on H8104 (8804) their priest’s office H3550: and the stranger H2114 (8801) that cometh nigh H7131 shall be put to death H4191 (8714).
003:011 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
003:012 And I, behold, I have taken H3947 (8804) the Levites H3881 from among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 instead of all the firstborn H1060 that openeth H6363 the matrix H7358 among the children H1121 of Israel H3478: therefore the Levites H3881 shall be mine;
003:013 Because all the firstborn H1060 [are] mine; [for] on the day H3117 that I smote H5221 (8687) all the firstborn H1060 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 I hallowed H6942 (8689) unto me all the firstborn H1060 in Israel H3478, both man H0120 and beast H0929: mine shall they be: I [am] the LORD H3068.
003:014 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 in the wilderness H4057 of Sinai H5514, saying H0559 (8800),

004:004 This [shall be] the service H5656 of the sons H1121 of Kohath H6955 in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, [about] the most H6944 holy things H6944:

004:017 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 and unto Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800),
004:018 Cut ye not off H3772 (8686) the tribe H7626 of the families H4940 of the Kohathites H6956 from among H8432 the Levites H3881:
004:019 But thus do H6213 (8798) unto them, that they may live H2421 (8804), and not die H4191 (8799), when they approach H5066 (8800) unto the most H6944 holy things H6944: Aaron H0175 and his sons H1121 shall go in H0935 (8799), and appoint H7760 (8804) them every H0376 one H0376 to his service H5656 and to his burden H4853:
004:020 But they shall not go in H0935 (8799) to see H7200 (8800) when the holy things H6944 are covered H1104 (8763), lest they die H4191 (8804).
004:021 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),

004:047 From thirty H7970 years H8141 old H1121 and upward H4605 even unto fifty H2572 years H8141 old H1121, every one that came H0935 (8802) to do H5647 (8800) the service of the ministry H5656, and the service H5656 of the burden H4853 in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150,

004:049 According to the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 they were numbered H6485 (8804) by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872, every H0376 one H0376 according to his service H5656, and according to his burden H4853: thus were they numbered H6485 (8803) of him, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
005:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
005:002 Command H6680 (8761) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that they put out H7971 (8762) of the camp H4264 every leper H6879 (8803), and every one that hath an issue H2100 (8802), and whosoever is defiled H2931 by the dead H5315:
005:003 Both male H2145 and female H5347 shall ye put out H7971 (8762), without H2351 the camp H4264 shall ye put H7971 (8762) them; that they defile H2930 (8762) not their camps H4264, in the midst H8432 whereof H0834 I dwell H7931 (8802).
005:004 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 did so H6213 (8799), and put them out H7971 (8762) without H2351 the camp H4264: as the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8765) unto Moses H4872, so did H6213 (8804) the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
005:005 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
005:006 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, When a man H0376 or woman H0802 shall commit H6213 (8799) any sin H2403 that men H0120 commit H4603 (8800), to do a trespass H4604 against the LORD H3068, and that person H5315 be guilty H0816 (8804);
005:007 Then they shall confess H3034 (8694) their sin H2403 which they have done H6213 (8804): and he shall recompense H7725 (8689) his trespass H0817 with the principal H7218 thereof, and add H3254 (8686) unto it the fifth H2549 [part] thereof, and give H5414 (8804) [it] unto [him] against whom he hath trespassed H0816 (8804).
005:008 But if the man H0376 have no kinsman H1350 (8802) to recompense H7725 (8687) the trespass H0817 unto, let the trespass H0817 be recompensed H7725 (8716) unto the LORD H3068, [even] to the priest H3548; beside the ram H0352 of the atonement H3725, whereby an atonement shall be made H3722 (8762) for him.
005:009 And every offering H8641 of all the holy things H6944 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, which they bring H7126 (8686) unto the priest H3548, shall be his.
005:010 And every man’s H0376 hallowed things H6944 shall be his: whatsoever any man H0376 giveth H5414 (8799) the priest H3548, it shall be his.
005:011 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
005:012 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, If any H0376 man’s H0376 wife H0802 go aside H7847 (8799), and commit H4603 (8804) a trespass H4604 against him,
005:013 And a man H0376 lie H7901 (8804) with her carnally H7902 H2233, and it be hid H5956 (8738) from the eyes H5869 of her husband H0376, and be kept close H5641 (8738), and she be defiled H2930 (8738), and [there be] no witness H5707 against her, neither she be taken H8610 (8738) [with the manner];
005:014 And the spirit H7307 of jealousy H7068 come H5674 (8804) upon him, and he be jealous H7065 (8765) of his wife H0802, and she be defiled H2930 (8738): or if the spirit H7307 of jealousy H7068 come H5674 (8804) upon him, and he be jealous H7065 (8765) of his wife H0802, and she be not defiled H2930 (8738):
005:015 Then shall the man H0376 bring H0935 (8689) his wife H0802 unto the priest H3548, and he shall bring H0935 (8689) her offering H7133 for her, the tenth H6224 [part] of an ephah H0374 of barley H8184 meal H7058; he shall pour H3332 (8799) no oil H8081 upon it, nor put H5414 (8799) frankincense H3828 thereon; for it [is] an offering H4503 of jealousy H7068, an offering H4503 of memorial H2146, bringing H2142 iniquity H5771 to remembrance H2142 (8688).
005:016 And the priest H3548 shall bring her near H7126 (8689), and set H5975 (8689) her before H6440 the LORD H3068:
005:017 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) holy H6918 water H4325 in an earthen H2789 vessel H3627; and of the dust H6083 that is in the floor H7172 of the tabernacle H4908 the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8799), and put H5414 (8804) [it] into the water H4325:
005:018 And the priest H3548 shall set H5975 (8689) the woman H0802 before H6440 the LORD H3068, and uncover H6544 (8804) the woman’s H0802 head H7218, and put H5414 (8804) the offering H4503 of memorial H2146 in her hands H3709, which [is] the jealousy H7068 offering H4503: and the priest H3548 shall have in his hand H3027 the bitter H4751 water H4325 that causeth the curse H0779 (8764):
005:019 And the priest H3548 shall charge her by an oath H7650 (8689), and say H0559 (8804) unto the woman H0802, If no man H0376 have lain H7901 (8804) with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside H7847 (8804) to uncleanness H2932 [with another] instead of thy husband H0376, be thou free H5352 (8734) from this bitter H4751 water H4325 that causeth the curse H0779 (8764):
005:020 But if thou hast gone aside H7847 (8804) [to another] instead of thy husband H0376, and if thou be defiled H2930 (8738), and some man H0376 have H5414 (8799) lain H7903 with thee beside H1107 thine husband H0376:
005:021 Then the priest H3548 shall charge H7650 (8689) the woman H0802 with an oath H7621 of cursing H0423, and the priest H3548 shall say H0559 (8804) unto the woman H0802, The LORD H3068 make H5414 (8799) thee a curse H0423 and an oath H7621 among H8432 thy people H5971, when the LORD H3068 doth make H5414 (8800) thy thigh H3409 to rot H5307 (8802), and thy belly H0990 to swell H6639;
005:022 And this water H4325 that causeth the curse H0779 (8764) shall go H0935 (8804) into thy bowels H4578, to make [thy] belly H0990 to swell H6638 (8687), and [thy] thigh H3409 to rot H5307 (8687): And the woman H0802 shall say H0559 (8804), Amen H0543, amen H0543.
005:023 And the priest H3548 shall write H3789 (8804) these curses H0423 in a book H5612, and he shall blot H4229 (8804) [them] out with the bitter H4751 water H4325:
005:024 And he shall cause the woman H0802 to drink H8248 (8689) the bitter H4751 water H4325 that causeth the curse H0779 (8764): and the water H4325 that causeth the curse H0779 (8764) shall enter H0935 (8804) into her, [and become] bitter H4751.
005:025 Then the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) the jealousy H7068 offering H4503 out of the woman’s H0802 hand H3027, and shall wave H5130 (8689) the offering H4503 before H6440 the LORD H3068, and offer H7126 (8689) it upon the altar H4196:
005:026 And the priest H3548 shall take an handful H7061 (8804) of the offering H4503, [even] the memorial H0234 thereof, and burn H6999 (8689) [it] upon the altar H4196, and afterward H0310 shall cause the woman H0802 to drink H8248 (8686) the water H4325.
005:027 And when he hath made her to drink H8248 (8689) the water H4325, then it shall come to pass, [that], if she be defiled H2930 (8738), and have done H4603 (8799) trespass H4604 against her husband H0376, that the water H4325 that causeth the curse H0779 (8764) shall enter H0935 (8804) into her, [and become] bitter H4751, and her belly H0990 shall swell H6638 (8804), and her thigh H3409 shall rot H5307 (8804): and the woman H0802 shall be a curse H0423 among H7130 her people H5971.
005:028 And if the woman H0802 be not defiled H2930 (8738), but be clean H2889; then she shall be free H5352 (8738), and shall conceive H2232 (8738) seed H2233.
005:029 This [is] the law H8451 of jealousies H7068, when a wife H0802 goeth aside H7847 (8799) [to another] instead of her husband H0376, and is defiled H2930 (8738);
005:030 Or when the spirit H7307 of jealousy H7068 cometh H5674 (8799) upon him H0376, and he be jealous H7065 (8765) over his wife H0802, and shall set H5975 (8689) the woman H0802 before H6440 the LORD H3068, and the priest H3548 shall execute H6213 (8804) upon her all this law H8451.
005:031 Then shall the man H0376 be guiltless H5352 (8738) from iniquity H5771, and this H1931 woman H0802 shall bear H5375 (8799) her iniquity H5771.
006:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
006:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When either man H0376 or woman H0802 shall separate H6381 (8686) [themselves] to vow H5087 (8800) a vow H5088 of a Nazarite H5139, to separate H5144 (8687) [themselves] unto the LORD H3068:
006:003 He shall separate H5144 (8686) [himself] from wine H3196 and strong drink H7941, and shall drink H8354 (8799) no vinegar H2558 of wine H3196, or vinegar H2558 of strong drink H7941, neither shall he drink H8354 (8799) any liquor H4952 of grapes H6025, nor eat H0398 (8799) moist H3892 grapes H6025, or dried H3002.
006:004 All the days H3117 of his separation H5145 shall he eat H0398 (8799) nothing that is made H6213 (8735) of the vine H3196 tree H1612, from the kernels H2785 even to the husk H2085.
006:005 All the days H3117 of the vow H5088 of his separation H5145 there shall no razor H8593 come H5674 (8799) upon his head H7218: until the days H3117 be fulfilled H4390 (8800), in the which he separateth H5144 (8686) [himself] unto the LORD H3068, he shall be holy H6918, [and] shall let the locks H6545 of the hair H8181 of his head H7218 grow H1431 (8763).
006:006 All the days H3117 that he separateth H5144 (8687) [himself] unto the LORD H3068 he shall come H0935 (8799) at no dead H4191 (8801) body H5315.
006:007 He shall not make himself unclean H2930 (8691) for his father H0001, or for his mother H0517, for his brother H0251, or for his sister H0269, when they die H4194: because the consecration H5145 of his God H0430 [is] upon his head H7218.
006:008 All the days H3117 of his separation H5145 he [is] holy H6918 unto the LORD H3068.
006:009 And if any man H4191 (8801) die H4191 (8799) very H6621 suddenly H6597 by him, and he hath defiled H2930 (8765) the head H7218 of his consecration H5145; then he shall shave H1548 (8765) his head H7218 in the day H3117 of his cleansing H2893, on the seventh H7637 day H3117 shall he shave H1548 (8762) it.
006:010 And on the eighth H8066 day H3117 he shall bring H0935 (8686) two H8147 turtles H8449, or two H8147 young H1121 pigeons H3123, to the priest H3548, to the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150:
006:011 And the priest H3548 shall offer H6213 (8804) the one H0259 for a sin offering H2403, and the other H0259 for a burnt offering H5930, and make an atonement H3722 (8765) for him, for that H0834 he sinned H2398 (8804) by the dead H5315, and shall hallow H6942 (8765) his head H7218 that same day H3117.
006:012 And he shall consecrate H5144 (8689) unto the LORD H3068 the days H3117 of his separation H5145, and shall bring H0935 (8689) a lamb H3532 of the first H1121 year H8141 for a trespass offering H0817: but the days H3117 that were before H7223 shall be lost H5307 (8799), because his separation H5145 was defiled H2930 (8804).

This [was] the dedication H2598 of the altar H4196, after H0310 that it was anointed H4886 (8736).
007:089 And when Moses H4872 was gone H0935 (8800) into the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 to speak H1696 (8762) with him, then he heard H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of one speaking H1696 (8763) unto him from off the mercy seat H3727 that [was] upon the ark H0727 of testimony H5715, from between the two H8147 cherubims H3742: and he spake H1696 (8693) unto him.
008:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
008:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto Aaron H0175, and say H0559 (8804) unto him, When thou lightest H5927 (8687) the lamps H5216, the seven H7651 lamps H5216 shall give light H0215 (8686) over against H6440 H4136 the candlestick H4501.
008:003 And Aaron H0175 did H6213 (8799) so; he lighted H5927 (8689) the lamps H5216 thereof over against H4136 H6440 the candlestick H4501, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
008:004 And this work H4639 of the candlestick H4501 [was of] beaten H4749 gold H2091, unto the shaft H3409 thereof, unto the flowers H6525 thereof, [was] beaten work H4749: according unto the pattern H4758 which the LORD H3068 had shewed H7200 (8689) Moses H4872, so he made H6213 (8804) the candlestick H4501.
008:005 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
008:006 Take H3947 (8798) the Levites H3881 from among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and cleanse H2891 (8765) them.
008:007 And thus shalt thou do H6213 (8799) unto them, to cleanse H2891 (8763) them: Sprinkle H5137 (8685) water H4325 of purifying H2403 upon them, and let them shave H8593 H5674 (8689) all their flesh H1320, and let them wash H3526 (8765) their clothes H0899, and [so] make themselves clean H2891 (8694).
008:008 Then let them take H3947 (8804) a young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499 with his meat offering H4503, [even] fine flour H5560 mingled H1101 (8803) with oil H8081, and another H8145 young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499 shalt thou take H3947 (8799) for a sin offering H2403.
008:009 And thou shalt bring H7126 (8689) the Levites H3881 before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and thou shalt gather H6950 the whole assembly H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 together H6950 (8689):
008:010 And thou shalt bring H7126 (8689) the Levites H3881 before H6440 the LORD H3068: and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 shall put H5564 (8804) their hands H3027 upon the Levites H3881:
008:011 And Aaron H0175 shall offer H5130 (8689) the Levites H3881 before H6440 the LORD H3068 [for] an offering H8573 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that they may execute H5647 (8800) the service H5656 of the LORD H3068.
008:012 And the Levites H3881 shall lay H5564 (8799) their hands H3027 upon the heads H7218 of the bullocks H6499: and thou shalt offer H6213 (8798) the one H0259 [for] a sin offering H2403, and the other H0259 [for] a burnt offering H5930, unto the LORD H3068, to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for the Levites H3881.
008:013 And thou shalt set H5975 (8689) the Levites H3881 before H6440 Aaron H0175, and before H6440 his sons H1121, and offer H5130 (8689) them [for] an offering H8573 unto the LORD H3068.
008:014 Thus shalt thou separate H0914 (8689) the Levites H3881 from among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478: and the Levites H3881 shall be mine.
008:015 And after H0310 that shall the Levites H3881 go in H0935 (8799) to do the service H5647 (8800) of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and thou shalt cleanse H2891 (8765) them, and offer H5130 (8689) them [for] an offering H8573.
008:016 For they [are] wholly given H5414 (8803) unto me from among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478; instead of such as open H6363 every womb H7358, [even instead of] the firstborn H1060 of all the children H1121 of Israel H3478, have I taken H3947 (8804) them unto me.
008:017 For all the firstborn H1060 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 [are] mine, [both] man H0120 and beast H0929: on the day H3117 that I smote H5221 (8687) every firstborn H1060 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 I sanctified H6942 (8689) them for myself.
008:018 And I have taken H3947 (8799) the Levites H3881 for all the firstborn H1060 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
008:019 And I have given H5414 (8799) the Levites H3881 [as] a gift H5414 (8803) to Aaron H0175 and to his sons H1121 from among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, to do H5647 (8800) the service H5656 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for the children H1121 of Israel H3478: that there be no plague H5063 among the children H1121 of Israel H3478, when the children H1121 of Israel H3478 come nigh H5066 (8800) unto the sanctuary H6944.
008:020 And Moses H4872, and Aaron H0175, and all the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, did H6213 (8799) to the Levites H3881 according unto all that the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872 concerning the Levites H3881, so did H6213 (8804) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 unto them.
008:021 And the Levites H3881 were purified H2398 (8691), and they washed H3526 (8762) their clothes H0899; and Aaron H0175 offered H5130 (8686) them [as] an offering H8573 before H6440 the LORD H3068; and Aaron H0175 made an atonement H3722 (8762) for them to cleanse H2891 (8763) them.
008:022 And after H0310 that went H0935 (8804) the Levites H3881 in to do H5647 (8800) their service H5656 in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 before H6440 Aaron H0175, and before H6440 his sons H1121: as the LORD H3068 had commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872 concerning the Levites H3881, so did H6213 (8804) they unto them.
008:023 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
008:024 This [is it] that [belongeth] unto the Levites H3881: from twenty H6242 and five H2568 years H8141 old H1121 and upward H4605 they shall go in H0935 (8799) to wait H6633 (8800) H6635 upon the service H5656 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150:
008:025 And from the age H1121 of fifty H2572 years H8141 they shall cease H7725 (8799) waiting H6635 upon the service H5656 [thereof], and shall serve H5647 (8799) no more:
008:026 But shall minister H8334 (8765) with their brethren H0251 in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, to keep H8104 (8800) the charge H4931, and shall do H5647 (8799) no service H5656. Thus shalt thou do H6213 (8799) unto the Levites H3881 touching their charge H4931.
009:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 in the wilderness H4057 of Sinai H5514, in the first H7223 month H2320 of the second H8145 year H8141 after they were come out H3318 (8800) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, saying H0559 (8800),
009:002 Let the children H1121 of Israel H3478 also keep H6213 (8799) the passover H6453 at his appointed season H4150.
009:003 In the fourteenth H0702 H6240 day H3117 of this month H2320, at even H6153, ye shall keep H6213 (8799) it in his appointed season H4150: according to all the rites H2708 of it, and according to all the ceremonies H4941 thereof, shall ye keep H6213 (8799) it.
009:004 And Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8762) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that they should keep H6213 (8800) the passover H6453.
009:005 And they kept H6213 (8799) the passover H6453 on the fourteenth H0702 H6240 day H3117 of the first H7223 month H2320 at even H6153 in the wilderness H4057 of Sinai H5514: according to all that the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872, so did H6213 (8804) the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
009:006 And there were certain men H0582, who were defiled H2931 by the dead body H5315 of a man H0120, that they could H3201 (8804) not keep H6213 (8800) the passover H6453 on that day H3117: and they came H7126 (8799) before H6440 Moses H4872 and before H6440 Aaron H0175 on that day H3117:
009:007 And those H1992 men H0582 said H0559 (8799) unto him, We [are] defiled H2931 by the dead body H5315 of a man H0120: wherefore are we kept back H1639 (8735), that we may not offer H7126 (8687) an offering H7133 of the LORD H3068 in his appointed season H4150 among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478?
009:008 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Stand still H5975 (8798), and I will hear H8085 (8799) what the LORD H3068 will command H6680 (8762) concerning you.
009:009 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
009:010 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), If any H0376 man H0376 of you or of your posterity H1755 shall be unclean H2931 by reason of a dead body H5315, or [be] in a journey H1870 afar off H7350, yet he shall keep H6213 (8804) the passover H6453 unto the LORD H3068.
009:011 The fourteenth H0702 H6240 day H3117 of the second H8145 month H2320 at even H6153 they shall keep H6213 (8799) it, [and] eat H0398 (8799) it with unleavened bread H4682 and bitter H4844 [herbs].
009:012 They shall leave H7604 (8686) none of it unto the morning H1242, nor break H7665 (8799) any bone H6106 of it: according to all the ordinances H2708 of the passover H6453 they shall keep H6213 (8799) it.
009:013 But the man H0376 that [is] clean H2889, and is not in a journey H1870, and forbeareth H2308 (8804) to keep H6213 (8800) the passover H6453, even the same soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from among his people H5971: because he brought H7126 (8689) not the offering H7133 of the LORD H3068 in his appointed season H4150, that man H0376 shall bear H5375 (8799) his sin H2399.
009:014 And if a stranger H1616 shall sojourn H1481 (8799) among you, and will keep H6213 (8804) the passover H6453 unto the LORD H3068; according to the ordinance H2708 of the passover H6453, and according to the manner H4941 thereof, so shall he do H6213 (8799): ye shall have one H0259 ordinance H2708, both for the stranger H1616, and for him that was born H0249 in the land H0776.
009:015 And on the day H3117 that the tabernacle H4908 was reared up H6965 (8687) the cloud H6051 covered H3680 (8765) the tabernacle H4908, [namely], the tent H0168 of the testimony H5715: and at even H6153 there was upon the tabernacle H4908 as it were the appearance H4758 of fire H0784, until the morning H1242.
009:016 So it was alway H8548: the cloud H6051 covered H3680 (8762) it [by day], and the appearance H4758 of fire H0784 by night H3915.
009:017 And when H6310 the cloud H6051 was taken up H5927 (8736) from the tabernacle H0168, then after H0310 that the children H1121 of Israel H3478 journeyed H5265 (8799): and in the place H4725 where the cloud H6051 abode H7931 (8799), there the children H1121 of Israel H3478 pitched their tents H2583 (8799).
009:018 At the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 journeyed H5265 (8799), and at the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 they pitched H2583 (8799): as long as H3117 the cloud H6051 abode H7931 (8799) upon the tabernacle H4908 they rested H2583 (8799) in their tents.
009:019 And when the cloud H6051 tarried long H0748 (8687) upon the tabernacle H4908 many H7227 days H3117, then the children H1121 of Israel H3478 kept H8104 (8804) the charge H4931 of the LORD H3068, and journeyed H5265 (8799) not.
009:020 And [so] it was H3426, when the cloud H6051 was a few H4557 days H3117 upon the tabernacle H4908; according to the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 they abode H2583 (8799) in their tents, and according to the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 they journeyed H5265 (8799).
009:021 And [so] it was H3426, when the cloud H6051 abode from even H6153 unto the morning H1242, and [that] the cloud H6051 was taken up H5927 (8738) in the morning H1242, then they journeyed H5265 (8804): whether [it was] by day H3119 or by night H3915 that the cloud H6051 was taken up H5927 (8738), they journeyed H5265 (8804).
009:022 Or [whether it were] two days H3117, or a month H2320, or a year H3117, that the cloud H6051 tarried H0748 (8687) upon the tabernacle H4908, remaining H7931 (8800) thereon, the children H1121 of Israel H3478 abode H2583 (8799) in their tents, and journeyed H5265 (8799) not: but when it was taken up H5927 (8736), they journeyed H5265 (8799).
009:023 At the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 they rested H2583 (8799) in the tents, and at the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 they journeyed H5265 (8799): they kept H8104 (8804) the charge H4931 of the LORD H3068, at the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
010:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
010:002 Make H6213 (8798) thee two H8147 trumpets H2689 of silver H3701; of a whole piece H4749 shalt thou make H6213 (8799) them: that thou mayest use H1961 (8804) them for the calling H4744 of the assembly H5712, and for the journeying H4550 of the camps H4264.
010:003 And when they shall blow H8628 (8804) with them H2004, all the assembly H5712 shall assemble H3259 (8738) themselves to thee at the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
010:004 And if they blow H8628 (8799) [but] with one H0259 [trumpet], then the princes H5387, [which are] heads H7218 of the thousands H0505 of Israel H3478, shall gather H3259 (8738) themselves unto thee.
010:005 When ye blow H8628 (8804) an alarm H8643, then the camps H4264 that lie H2583 (8802) on the east parts H6924 shall go forward H5265 (8804).
010:006 When ye blow H8628 (8804) an alarm H8643 the second time H8145, then the camps H4264 that lie H2583 (8802) on the south side H8486 shall take their journey H5265 (8804): they shall blow H8628 (8799) an alarm H8643 for their journeys H4550.
010:007 But when the congregation H6951 is to be gathered together H6950 (8687), ye shall blow H8628 (8799), but ye shall not sound an alarm H7321 (8686).
010:008 And the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175, the priests H3548, shall blow H8628 (8799) with the trumpets H2689; and they shall be to you for an ordinance H2708 for ever H5769 throughout your generations H1755.
010:009 And if ye go H0935 (8799) to war H4421 in your land H0776 against H6862 the enemy that oppresseth H6887 (8802) you, then ye shall blow an alarm H7321 (8689) with the trumpets H2689; and ye shall be remembered H2142 (8738) before H6440 the LORD H3068 your God H0430, and ye shall be saved H3467 (8738) from your enemies H0341 (8802).
010:010 Also in the day H3117 of your gladness H8057, and in your solemn days H4150, and in the beginnings H7218 of your months H2320, ye shall blow H8628 (8804) with the trumpets H2689 over your burnt offerings H5930, and over the sacrifices H2077 of your peace offerings H8002; that they may be to you for a memorial H2146 before H6440 your God H0430: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
010:011 And it came to pass on the twentieth H6242 [day] of the second H8145 month H2320, in the second H8145 year H8141, that the cloud H6051 was taken up H5927 (8738) from off the tabernacle H4908 of the testimony H5715.
010:012 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 took H5265 (8799) their journeys H4550 out of the wilderness H4057 of Sinai H5514; and the cloud H6051 rested H7931 (8799) in the wilderness H4057 of Paran H6290.
010:013 And they first H7223 took their journey H5265 (8799) according to the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
010:014 In the first H7223 [place] went H5265 (8799) the standard H1714 of the camp H4264 of the children H1121 of Judah H3063 according to their armies H6635: and over his host [was] Nahshon H5177 the son H1121 of Amminadab H5992.
010:015 And over the host H6635 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Issachar H3485 [was] Nethaneel H5417 the son H1121 of Zuar H6686.
010:016 And over the host H6635 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Zebulun H2074 [was] Eliab H0446 the son H1121 of Helon H2497.
010:017 And the tabernacle H4908 was taken down H3381 (8717); and the sons H1121 of Gershon H1648 and the sons H1121 of Merari H4847 set forward H5265 (8804), bearing H5375 (8802) the tabernacle H4908.
010:018 And the standard H1714 of the camp H4264 of Reuben H7205 set forward H5265 (8804) according to their armies H6635: and over his host H6635 [was] Elizur H0468 the son H1121 of Shedeur H7707.
010:019 And over the host H6635 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Simeon H8095 [was] Shelumiel H8017 the son H1121 of Zurishaddai H6701.
010:020 And over the host H6635 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Gad H1410 [was] Eliasaph H0460 the son H1121 of Deuel H1845.
010:021 And the Kohathites H6956 set forward H5265 (8804), bearing H5375 (8802) the sanctuary H4720: and [the other] did set up H6965 (8689) the tabernacle H4908 against they came H0935 (8800).
010:022 And the standard H1714 of the camp H4264 of the children H1121 of Ephraim H0669 set forward H5265 (8804) according to their armies H6635: and over his host H6635 [was] Elishama H0476 the son H1121 of Ammihud H5989.
010:023 And over the host H6635 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Manasseh H4519 [was] Gamaliel H1583 the son H1121 of Pedahzur H6301.
010:024 And over the host H6635 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 [was] Abidan H0027 the son H1121 of Gideoni H1441.
010:025 And the standard H1714 of the camp H4264 of the children H1121 of Dan H1835 set forward H5265 (8804), [which was] the rereward H0622 (8764) of all the camps H4264 throughout their hosts H6635: and over his host H6635 [was] Ahiezer H0295 the son H1121 of Ammishaddai H5996.
010:026 And over the host H6635 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Asher H0836 [was] Pagiel H6295 the son H1121 of Ocran H5918.
010:027 And over the host H6635 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Naphtali H5321 [was] Ahira H0299 the son H1121 of Enan H5881.
010:028 Thus [were] H0428 the journeyings H4550 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 according to their armies H6635, when they set forward H5265 (8799).
010:029 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto Hobab H2246, the son H1121 of Raguel H7467 the Midianite H4084, Moses H4872 ’ father in law H2859 (8802), We are journeying H5265 (8802) unto the place H4725 of which the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804), I will give H5414 (8799) it you: come H3212 (8798) thou with us, and we will do thee good H2895 (8689): for the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) good H2896 concerning Israel H3478.
010:030 And he said H0559 (8799) unto him, I will not go H3212 (8799); but I will depart H3212 (8799) to mine own land H0776, and to my kindred H4138.
010:031 And he said H0559 (8799), Leave H5800 (8799) us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest H3651 H3045 (8804) how we are to encamp H2583 (8800) in the wilderness H4057, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes H5869.
010:032 And it shall be, if thou go H3212 (8799) with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness H2896 the LORD H3068 shall do H3190 (8686) unto us, the same will we do H2895 (8689) unto thee.
010:033 And they departed H5265 (8799) from the mount H2022 of the LORD H3068 three H7969 days H3117 ’ journey H1870: and the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 went H5265 (8802) before H6440 them in the three H7969 days H3117 ’ journey H1870, to search out H8446 (8800) a resting place H4496 for them.
010:034 And the cloud H6051 of the LORD H3068 [was] upon them by day H3119, when they went out H5265 (8800) of the camp H4264.
010:035 And it came to pass, when the ark H0727 set forward H5265 (8800), that Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799), Rise up H6965 (8798), LORD H3068, and let thine enemies H0341 (8802) be scattered H6327 (8799); and let them that hate H8130 (8764) thee flee H5127 (8799) before H6440 thee.
010:036 And when it rested H5117 (8800), he said H0559 (8799), Return H7725 (8798), O LORD H3068, unto the many H7233 thousands H0505 of Israel H3478.
011:001 ¶  And [when] the people H5971 complained H0596 (8693), it displeased H7451 H0241 the LORD H3068: and the LORD H3068 heard H8085 (8799) [it]; and his anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799); and the fire H0784 of the LORD H3068 burnt H1197 (8799) among them, and consumed H0398 (8799) [them that were] in the uttermost parts H7097 of the camp H4264.
011:002 And the people H5971 cried H6817 (8799) unto Moses H4872; and when Moses H4872 prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068, the fire H0784 was quenched H8257 (8799).
011:003 And he called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the H1931 place H4725 Taberah H8404: because the fire H0784 of the LORD H3068 burnt H1197 (8804) among them.
011:004 And the mixt multitude H0628 that [was] among H7130 them fell a lusting H0183 (8694) H8378: and the children H1121 of Israel H3478 also wept H1058 (8799) again H7725 (8799), and said H0559 (8799), Who shall give us flesh H1320 to eat H0398 (8686)?
011:005 We remember H2142 (8804) the fish H1710, which we did eat H0398 (8799) in Egypt H4714 freely H2600; the cucumbers H7180, and the melons H0020, and the leeks H2682, and the onions H1211, and the garlick H7762:
011:006 But now our soul H5315 [is] dried away H3002: [there is] nothing at all, beside H1115 this manna H4478, [before] our eyes H5869.
011:007 And the manna H4478 [was] as coriander H1407 seed H2233, and the colour H5869 thereof as the colour H5869 of bdellium H0916.
011:008 [And] the people H5971 went about H7751 (8804), and gathered H3950 (8804) [it], and ground H2912 (8804) [it] in mills H7347, or beat H1743 (8804) [it] in a mortar H4085, and baked H1310 (8765) [it] in pans H6517, and made H6213 (8804) cakes H5692 of it: and the taste H2940 of it was as the taste H2940 of fresh H3955 oil H8081.
011:009 And when the dew H2919 fell H3381 (8800) upon the camp H4264 in the night H3915, the manna H4478 fell H3381 (8799) upon it.
011:010 Then Moses H4872 heard H8085 (8799) the people H5971 weep H1058 (8802) throughout their families H4940, every man H0376 in the door H6607 of his tent H0168: and the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8799) greatly H3966; Moses H4872 also was displeased H7489 (8804) H5869.
011:011 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, Wherefore hast thou afflicted H7489 (8689) thy servant H5650? and wherefore have I not found H4672 (8804) favour H2580 in thy sight H5869, that thou layest H7760 (8800) the burden H4853 of all this people H5971 upon me?
011:012 Have I conceived H2029 (8804) all this people H5971? have I begotten H3205 (8804) them, that thou shouldest say H0559 (8799) unto me, Carry H5375 (8798) them in thy bosom H2436, as a nursing father H0539 (8802) beareth H5375 (8799) the sucking child H3243 (8802), unto the land H0127 which thou swarest H7650 (8738) unto their fathers H0001?
011:013 Whence H0370 should I have flesh H1320 to give H5414 (8800) unto all this people H5971? for they weep H1058 (8799) unto me, saying H0559 (8800), Give H5414 (8798) us flesh H1320, that we may eat H0398 (8799).
011:014 I am not able H3201 (8799) to bear H5375 (8800) all this people H5971 alone H0905, because [it is] too heavy H3515 for me.
011:015 And if thou deal H6213 (8802) thus with me, kill H2026 (8798) me, I pray thee, out of hand H2026 (8800), if I have found H4672 (8804) favour H2580 in thy sight H5869; and let me not see H7200 (8799) my wretchedness H7451.
011:016 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Gather H0622 (8798) unto me seventy H7657 men H0376 of the elders H2205 of Israel H3478, whom thou knowest H3045 (8804) to be the elders H2205 of the people H5971, and officers H7860 (8802) over them; and bring H3947 (8804) them unto the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, that they may stand H3320 (8694) there with thee.
011:017 And I will come down H3381 (8804) and talk H1696 (8765) with thee there: and I will take H0680 (8804) of the spirit H7307 which [is] upon thee, and will put H7760 (8804) [it] upon them; and they shall bear H5375 (8804) the burden H4853 of the people H5971 with thee, that thou bear H5375 (8799) [it] not thyself alone.
011:018 And say H0559 (8799) thou unto the people H5971, Sanctify H6942 (8690) yourselves against to morrow H4279, and ye shall eat H0398 (8804) flesh H1320: for ye have wept H1058 (8804) in the ears H0241 of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), Who shall give us flesh H1320 to eat H0398 (8686)? for [it was] well H2895 (8804) with us in Egypt H4714: therefore the LORD H3068 will give H5414 (8804) you flesh H1320, and ye shall eat H0398 (8804).
011:019 Ye shall not eat H0398 (8799) one H0259 day H3117, nor two days H3117, nor five H2568 days H3117, neither ten H6235 days H3117, nor twenty H6242 days H3117;
011:020 [But] even a whole month H2320 H3117, until it come out H3318 (8799) at your nostrils H0639, and it be loathsome H2214 unto you: because H3282 that ye have despised H3988 (8804) the LORD H3068 which [is] among H7130 you, and have wept H1058 (8799) before H6440 him, saying H0559 (8800), Why came we forth H3318 (8804) out of Egypt H4714?
011:021 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799), The people H5971, among H7130 whom I [am], [are] six H8337 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 footmen H7273; and thou hast said H0559 (8804), I will give H5414 (8799) them flesh H1320, that they may eat H0398 (8804) a whole H3117 month H2320.
011:022 Shall the flocks H6629 and the herds H1241 be slain H7819 (8735) for them, to suffice H4672 (8804) them? or shall all the fish H1709 of the sea H3220 be gathered together H0622 (8735) for them, to suffice H4672 (8804) them?
011:023 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Is the LORD’S H3068 hand H3027 waxed short H7114 (8799)? thou shalt see H7200 (8799) now whether my word H1697 shall come to pass H7136 (8799) unto thee or not.
011:024 And Moses H4872 went out H3318 (8799), and told H1696 (8762) the people H5971 the words H1697 of the LORD H3068, and gathered H0622 (8799) the seventy H7657 men H0376 of the elders H2205 of the people H5971, and set H5975 (8686) them round about H5439 the tabernacle H0168.
011:025 And the LORD H3068 came down H3381 (8799) in a cloud H6051, and spake H1696 (8762) unto him, and took H0680 (8686) of the spirit H7307 that [was] upon him, and gave H5414 (8799) [it] unto the seventy H7657 elders H2205 H0376: and it came to pass, [that], when the spirit H7307 rested H5117 (8800) upon them, they prophesied H5012 (8691), and did not cease H3254 (8804).
011:026 But there remained H7604 (8735) two H8147 [of the] men H0582 in the camp H4264, the name H8034 of the one H0259 [was] Eldad H0419, and the name H8034 of the other H8145 Medad H4312: and the spirit H7307 rested H5117 (8799) upon them; and they [were] of them that were written H3789 (8803), but went not out H3318 (8804) unto the tabernacle H0168: and they prophesied H5012 (8691) in the camp H4264.
011:027 And there ran H7323 (8799) a young man H5288, and told H5046 (8686) Moses H4872, and said H0559 (8799), Eldad H0419 and Medad H4312 do prophesy H5012 (8693) in the camp H4264.
011:028 And Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, the servant H8334 (8764) of Moses H4872, [one] of his young men H0979, answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), My lord H0113 Moses H4872, forbid H3607 (8798) them.
011:029 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Enviest H7065 (8764) thou for my sake? would God that all the H5414 (8799) LORD’S H3068 people H5971 were prophets H5030, [and] that the LORD H3068 would put H5414 (8799) his spirit H7307 upon them!
011:030 And Moses H4872 gat H0622 (8735) him into the camp H4264, he and the elders H2205 of Israel H3478.
011:031 And there went forth H5265 (8804) a wind H7307 from the LORD H3068, and brought H1468 (8799) quails H7958 from the sea H3220, and let [them] fall H5203 (8799) by the camp H4264, as it were a day’s H3117 journey H1870 on this side H3541, and as it were a day’s H3117 journey H1870 on the other side H3541, round about H5439 the camp H4264, and as it were two cubits H0520 [high] upon the face H6440 of the earth H0776.
011:032 And the people H5971 stood up H6965 (8799) all that day H3117, and all [that] night H3915, and all the next H4283 day H3117, and they gathered H0622 (8799) the quails H7958: he that gathered least H4591 (8688) gathered H0622 (8804) ten H6235 homers H2563: and they spread H7849 (8799) [them] all abroad H7849 (8800) for themselves round about H5439 the camp H4264.
011:033 And while the flesh H1320 [was] yet H2962 between their teeth H8127, ere it was chewed H3772 (8735), the wrath H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8804) against the people H5971, and the LORD H3068 smote H5221 (8686) the people H5971 with a very H3966 great H7227 plague H4347.
011:034 And he called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of that place H4725 Kibrothhattaavah H6914: because there they buried H6912 (8804) the people H5971 that lusted H0183 (8693).
011:035 [And] the people H5971 journeyed H5265 (8804) from Kibrothhattaavah H6914 unto Hazeroth H2698; and abode at Hazeroth H2698.
012:001 ¶  And Miriam H4813 and Aaron H0175 spake H1696 (8762) against Moses H4872 because of H0182 the Ethiopian H3571 woman H0802 whom he had married H3947 (8804): for he had married H3947 (8804) an Ethiopian H3571 woman H0802.
012:002 And they said H0559 (8799), Hath the LORD H3068 indeed spoken H1696 (8765) only by Moses H4872? hath he not spoken H1696 (8765) also by us? And the LORD H3068 heard H8085 (8799) [it].
012:003 (Now the man H0376 Moses H4872 [was] very H3966 meek H6035 (8675) H6035, above all the men H0120 which [were] upon the face H6440 of the earth H0127.)
012:004 And the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) suddenly H6597 unto Moses H4872, and unto Aaron H0175, and unto Miriam H4813, Come out H3318 (8798) ye three H7969 unto the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150. And they three H7969 came out H3318 (8799).
012:005 And the LORD H3068 came down H3381 (8799) in the pillar H5982 of the cloud H6051, and stood H5975 (8799) [in] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168, and called H7121 (8799) Aaron H0175 and Miriam H4813: and they both H8147 came forth H3318 (8799).
012:006 And he said H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798) now my words H1697: If there be a prophet H5030 among you, [I] the LORD H3068 will make myself known H3045 (8691) unto him in a vision H4759, [and] will speak H1696 (8762) unto him in a dream H2472.
012:007 My servant H5650 Moses H4872 [is] not so, who [is] faithful H0539 (8737) in all mine house H1004.
012:008 With him will I speak H1696 (8762) mouth H6310 to mouth H6310, even apparently H4758, and not in dark speeches H2420; and the similitude H8544 of the LORD H3068 shall he behold H5027 (8686): wherefore then were ye not afraid H3372 (8804) to speak H1696 (8763) against my servant H5650 Moses H4872?
012:009 And the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8799) against them; and he departed H3212 (8799).
012:010 And the cloud H6051 departed H5493 (8804) from off the tabernacle H0168; and, behold, Miriam H4813 [became] leprous H6879 (8794), [white] as snow H7950: and Aaron H0175 looked H6437 (8799) upon Miriam H4813, and, behold, [she was] leprous H6879 (8794).
012:011 And Aaron H0175 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Alas H0994, my lord H0113, I beseech thee, lay H7896 (8799) not the sin H2403 upon us, wherein we have done foolishly H2973 (8738), and wherein we have sinned H2398 (8804).
012:012 Let her not be as one dead H4994 H4191 (8801), of whom the flesh H1320 is half H2677 consumed H0398 (8735) when he cometh out H3318 (8800) of his mother’s H0517 womb H7358.
012:013 And Moses H4872 cried H6817 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), Heal H7495 (8798) her now, O God H0410, I beseech thee.
012:014 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, If her father H0001 had but H3417 (8800) spit H3417 (8804) in her face H6440, should she not be ashamed H3637 (8735) seven H7651 days H3117? let her be shut H5462 (8735) out H2351 from the camp H4264 seven H7651 days H3117, and after H0310 that let her be received H0622 (8735) in [again].
012:015 And Miriam H4813 was shut H5462 (8735) out H2351 from the camp H4264 seven H7651 days H3117: and the people H5971 journeyed H5265 (8804) not till Miriam H4813 was brought H0622 (8736) in [again].
012:016 And afterward H0310 the people H5971 removed H5265 (8804) from Hazeroth H2698, and pitched H2583 (8799) in the wilderness H4057 of Paran H6290.
013:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
013:002 Send H7971 (8798) thou men H0582, that they may search H8446 (8799) the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, which I give H5414 (8802) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478: of every H0376 tribe H4294 of their fathers H0001 shall ye send H7971 (8799) a man H0259, every one a ruler H5387 among them.
013:003 And Moses H4872 by the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8799) them from the wilderness H4057 of Paran H6290: all those men H0582 [were] H1992 heads H7218 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
013:004 And these [were] their names H8034: of the tribe H4294 of Reuben H7205, Shammua H8051 the son H1121 of Zaccur H2139.
013:005 Of the tribe H4294 of Simeon H8095, Shaphat H8202 the son H1121 of Hori H2753.
013:006 Of the tribe H4294 of Judah H3063, Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312.
013:007 Of the tribe H4294 of Issachar H3485, Igal H3008 the son H1121 of Joseph H3130.
013:008 Of the tribe H4294 of Ephraim H0669, Oshea H1954 the son H1121 of Nun H5126.
013:009 Of the tribe H4294 of Benjamin H1144, Palti H6406 the son H1121 of Raphu H7505.
013:010 Of the tribe H4294 of Zebulun H2074, Gaddiel H1427 the son H1121 of Sodi H5476.
013:011 Of the tribe H4294 of Joseph H3130, [namely], of the tribe H4294 of Manasseh H4519, Gaddi H1426 the son H1121 of Susi H5485.
013:012 Of the tribe H4294 of Dan H1835, Ammiel H5988 the son H1121 of Gemalli H1582.
013:013 Of the tribe H4294 of Asher H0836, Sethur H5639 the son H1121 of Michael H4317.
013:014 Of the tribe H4294 of Naphtali H5321, Nahbi H5147 the son H1121 of Vophsi H2058.
013:015 Of the tribe H4294 of Gad H1410, Geuel H1345 the son H1121 of Machi H4352.
013:016 These [are] the names H8034 of the men H0582 which Moses H4872 sent H7971 (8804) to spy out H8446 (8800) the land H0776. And Moses H4872 called H7121 (8799) Oshea H1954 the son H1121 of Nun H5126 Jehoshua H3091.
013:017 And Moses H4872 sent H7971 (8799) them to spy out H8446 (8800) the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, Get you up H5927 (8798) this [way] southward H5045, and go up H5927 (8804) into the mountain H2022:
013:018 And see H7200 (8804) the land H0776, what it [is]; and the people H5971 that dwelleth H3427 (8802) therein, whether they [be] strong H2389 or weak H7504, few H4592 or many H7227;
013:019 And what the land H0776 [is] that they dwell in H3427 (8802), whether it [be] good H2896 or bad H7451; and what cities H5892 [they be] that they dwell H3427 (8802) in H2007, whether in tents H4264, or in strong holds H4013;
013:020 And what the land H0776 [is], whether it [be] fat H8082 or lean H7330, whether there be H3426 wood H6086 therein, or not. And be ye of good courage H2388 (8694), and bring H3947 (8804) of the fruit H6529 of the land H0776. Now the time H3117 [was] the time H3117 of the firstripe H1061 grapes H6025.
013:021 So they went up H5927 (8799), and searched H8446 (8799) the land H0776 from the wilderness H4057 of Zin H6790 unto Rehob H7340, as men come H0935 (8800) to Hamath H2574.
013:022 And they ascended H5927 (8799) by the south H5045, and came H0935 (8799) unto Hebron H2275; where Ahiman H0289, Sheshai H8344, and Talmai H8526, the children H3211 of Anak H6061, [were]. (Now Hebron H2275 was built H1129 (8738) seven H7651 years H8141 before H6440 Zoan H6814 in Egypt H4714.)
013:023 And they came H0935 (8799) unto the brook H5158 of Eshcol H0812, and cut down H3772 (8799) from thence a branch H2156 with one H0259 cluster H0811 of grapes H6025, and they bare H5375 (8799) it between two H8147 upon a staff H4132; and [they brought] of the pomegranates H7416, and of the figs H8384.
013:024 The place H4725 was called H7121 (8804) the brook H5158 Eshcol H0812, because of H0182 the cluster of grapes H0811 which the children H1121 of Israel H3478 cut down H3772 (8804) from thence.
013:025 And they returned H7725 (8799) from searching H8446 (8800) of the land H0776 after H7093 forty H0705 days H3117.
013:026 And they went H3212 (8799) and came H0935 (8799) to Moses H4872, and to Aaron H0175, and to all the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, unto the wilderness H4057 of Paran H6290, to Kadesh H6946; and brought back H7725 (8686) word H1697 unto them, and unto all the congregation H5712, and shewed H7200 (8686) them the fruit H6529 of the land H0776.
013:027 And they told H5608 (8762) him, and said H0559 (8799), We came H0935 (8804) unto the land H0776 whither thou sentest H7971 (8804) us, and surely it floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706; and this [is] the fruit H6529 of it.
013:028 Nevertheless H0657 the people H5971 [be] strong H5794 that dwell H3427 (8802) in the land H0776, and the cities H5892 [are] walled H1219 (8803), [and] very H3966 great H1419: and moreover we saw H7200 (8804) the children H3211 of Anak H6061 there.
013:029 The Amalekites H6002 dwell H3427 (8802) in the land H0776 of the south H5045: and the Hittites H2850, and the Jebusites H2983, and the Amorites H0567, dwell H3427 (8802) in the mountains H2022: and the Canaanites H3669 dwell H3427 (8802) by the sea H3220, and by the coast H3027 of Jordan H3383.
013:030 And Caleb H3612 stilled H2013 (8686) the people H5971 before Moses H4872, and said H0559 (8799), Let us go up H5927 (8799) at once H5927 (8800), and possess H3423 (8804) it; for we are well able H3201 (8799) to overcome H3201 (8800) it.
013:031 But the men H0582 that went up H5927 (8804) with him said H0559 (8804), We be not able H3201 (8799) to go up H5927 (8800) against the people H5971; for they [are] stronger H2389 than we.
013:032 And they brought up H3318 (8686) an evil report H1681 of the land H0776 which they had searched H8446 (8804) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), The land H0776, through which we have gone H5674 (8804) to search H8446 (8800) it, [is] a land H0776 that eateth up H0398 (8802) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof; and all the people H5971 that we saw H7200 (8804) in it H8432 [are] men H0582 of a great stature H4060.
013:033 And there we saw H7200 (8804) the giants H5303, the sons H1121 of Anak H6061, [which come] of the giants H5303: and we were in our own sight H5869 as grasshoppers H2284, and so we were in their sight H5869.
014:001 ¶  And all the congregation H5712 lifted up H5375 (8799) their voice H6963, and cried H5414 (8799); and the people H5971 wept H1058 (8799) that night H3915.
014:002 And all the children H1121 of Israel H3478 murmured H3885 (8735) against Moses H4872 and against Aaron H0175: and the whole congregation H5712 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Would God H3863 that we had died H4191 (8804) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714! or would God H3863 we had died H4191 (8804) in this wilderness H4057!
014:003 And wherefore hath the LORD H3068 brought H0935 (8688) us unto this land H0776, to fall H5307 (8800) by the sword H2719, that our wives H0802 and our children H2945 should be a prey H0957? were it not better H2896 for us to return H7725 (8800) into Egypt H4714?
014:004 And they said H0559 (8799) one H0376 to another H0251, Let us make H5414 (8799) a captain H7218, and let us return H7725 (8799) into Egypt H4714.
014:005 Then Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175 fell H5307 (8799) on their faces H6440 before H6440 all the assembly H6951 of the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
014:006 And Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, and Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312, [which were] of them that searched H8446 (8802) the land H0776, rent H7167 (8804) their clothes H0899:
014:007 And they spake H0559 (8799) unto all the company H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), The land H0776, which we passed H5674 (8804) through to search H8446 (8800) it, [is] an exceeding H3966 H3966 good H2896 land H0776.
014:008 If the LORD H3068 delight H2654 (8804) in us, then he will bring H0935 (8689) us into this land H0776, and give H5414 (8804) it us; a land H0776 which floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706.
014:009 Only rebel H4775 (8799) not ye against the LORD H3068, neither fear H3372 (8799) ye the people H5971 of the land H0776; for they [are] bread H3899 for us: their defence H6738 is departed H5493 (8804) from them, and the LORD H3068 [is] with us: fear H3372 (8799) them not.
014:010 But all the congregation H5712 bade H0559 (8799) stone H7275 (8800) them with stones H0068. And the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8738) in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 before all the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
014:011 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, How long will this people H5971 provoke H5006 (8762) me? and how long will it be ere H3808 they believe H0539 (8686) me, for all the signs H0226 which I have shewed H6213 (8804) among H7130 them?
014:012 I will smite H5221 (8686) them with the pestilence H1698, and disinherit H3423 (8686) them, and will make H6213 (8799) of thee a greater H1419 nation H1471 and mightier H6099 than they.
014:013 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, Then the Egyptians H4714 shall hear H8085 (8804) [it], (for thou broughtest up H5927 (8689) this people H5971 in thy might H3581 from among H7130 them;)
014:014 And they will tell H0559 (8804) [it] to the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of this land H0776: [for] they have heard H8085 (8804) that thou LORD H3068 [art] among H7130 this people H5971, that thou LORD H3068 art seen H7200 (8738) face H5869 to face H5869, and [that] thy cloud H6051 standeth H5975 (8802) over them, and [that] thou goest H1980 (8802) before H6440 them, by day time H3119 in a pillar H5982 of a cloud H6051, and in a pillar H5982 of fire H0784 by night H3915.
014:015 Now [if] thou shalt kill H4191 (8689) [all] this people H5971 as one H0259 man H0376, then the nations H1471 which have heard H8085 (8804) the fame H8088 of thee will speak H0559 (8804), saying H0559 (8800),
014:016 Because the LORD H3068 was not H1115 able H3201 (8800) to bring H0935 (8687) this people H5971 into the land H0776 which he sware H7650 (8738) unto them, therefore he hath slain H7819 (8799) them in the wilderness H4057.
014:017 And now, I beseech thee, let the power H3581 of my Lord H0136 be great H1431 (8799), according H0834 as thou hast spoken H1696 (8765), saying H0559 (8800),
014:018 The LORD H3068 [is] longsuffering H0750 H0639, and of great H7227 mercy H2617, forgiving H5375 (8802) iniquity H5771 and transgression H6588, and by no means H5352 (8763) clearing H5352 (8762) [the guilty], visiting H6485 (8802) the iniquity H5771 of the fathers H0001 upon the children H1121 unto the third H8029 and fourth H7256 [generation].
014:019 Pardon H5545 (8798), I beseech thee, the iniquity H5771 of this people H5971 according unto the greatness H1433 of thy mercy H2617, and as thou hast forgiven H5375 (8804) this people H5971, from Egypt H4714 even until now H2008.
014:020 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), I have pardoned H5545 (8804) according to thy word H1697:
014:021 But [as] truly H0199 [as] I live H2416, all the earth H0776 shall be filled H4390 (8735) with the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068.
014:022 Because all those men H0582 which have seen H7200 (8802) my glory H3519, and my miracles H0226, which I did H6213 (8804) in Egypt H4714 and in the wilderness H4057, and have tempted H5254 (8762) H0853 me now these ten H6235 times H6471, and have not hearkened H8085 (8804) to my voice H6963;
014:023 Surely they shall not H0518 see H7200 (8799) the land H0776 which I sware H7650 (8738) unto their fathers H0001, neither shall any of them that provoked H5006 (8764) me see H7200 (8799) it:
014:024 But my servant H5650 Caleb H3612, because H6118 he had another H0312 spirit H7307 with him, and hath followed H0310 me fully H4390 (8762), him will I bring H0935 (8689) into the land H0776 whereinto he went H0935 (8804); and his seed H2233 shall possess H3423 (8686) it.
014:025 (Now the Amalekites H6003 and the Canaanites H3669 dwelt H3427 (8802) in the valley H6010.) To morrow H4279 turn H6437 (8798) you, and get H5265 (8798) you into the wilderness H4057 by the way H1870 of the Red H5488 sea H3220.
014:026 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 and unto Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800),
014:027 How long [shall I bear with] this evil H7451 congregation H5712, which murmur H3885 (8688) against me? I have heard H8085 (8804) the murmurings H8519 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, which they murmur H3885 (8688) against me.
014:028 Say H0559 (8798) unto them, [As truly as] H3808 I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, as ye have spoken H1696 (8765) in mine ears H0241, so will I do H6213 (8799) to you:
014:029 Your carcases H6297 shall fall H5307 (8799) in this wilderness H4057; and all that were numbered H6485 (8803) of you, according to your whole number H4557, from twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 and upward H4605, which have murmured H3885 (8689) against me,
014:030 Doubtless ye shall not H0518 come H0935 (8799) into the land H0776, [concerning] which I sware H3027 H5375 (8804) to make you dwell H7931 (8763) therein, save Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312, and Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126.
014:031 But your little ones H2945, which ye said H0559 (8804) should be a prey H0957, them will I bring in H0935 (8689), and they shall know H3045 (8804) the land H0776 which ye have despised H3988 (8804).
014:032 But [as for] you, your carcases H6297, they shall fall H5307 (8799) in this wilderness H4057.
014:033 And your children H1121 shall wander H7462 (8802) in the wilderness H4057 forty H0705 years H8141, and bear H5375 (8804) your whoredoms H2184, until your carcases H6297 be wasted H8552 (8800) in the wilderness H4057.
014:034 After the number H4557 of the days H3117 in which ye searched H8446 (8804) the land H0776, [even] forty H0705 days H3117, each day H3117 for a year H8141 H3117 H8141, shall ye bear H5375 (8799) your iniquities H5771, [even] forty H0705 years H8141, and ye shall know H3045 (8804) my breach of promise H8569.
014:035 I the LORD H3068 have said H1696 (8765), I will surely H0518 H3808 do H6213 (8799) it H2063 unto all this evil H7451 congregation H5712, that are gathered together H3259 (8737) against me: in this wilderness H4057 they shall be consumed H8552 (8735), and there they shall die H4191 (8799).
014:036 And the men H0582, which Moses H4872 sent H7971 (8804) to search H8446 (8800) the land H0776, who returned H7725 (8799), and made all the congregation H5712 to murmur H3885 (8686) (8675) H3885 (8735) against him, by bringing up H3318 (8687) a slander H1681 upon the land H0776,
014:037 Even those H0582 men H0582 that did bring up H3318 (8688) the evil H7451 report H1681 upon the land H0776, died H4191 (8799) by the plague H4046 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
014:038 But Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, and Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312, [which were] of the men H1992 H0582 that went H1980 (8802) to search H8446 (8800) the land H0776, lived H2421 (8804) [still].
014:039 And Moses H4872 told H1696 (8762) these sayings H1697 unto all the children H1121 of Israel H3478: and the people H5971 mourned H0056 (8691) greatly H3966.
014:040 And they rose up early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, and gat them up H5927 (8799) into the top H7218 of the mountain H2022, saying H0559 (8800), Lo H2009, we [be here], and will go up H5927 (8804) unto the place H4725 which the LORD H3068 hath promised H0559 (8804): for we have sinned H2398 (8804).
014:041 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799), Wherefore now do ye transgress H5674 (8802) the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068? but it shall not prosper H6743 (8799).
014:042 Go not up H5927 (8799), for the LORD H3068 [is] not among H7130 you; that ye be not smitten H5062 (8735) before H6440 your enemies H0341 (8802).
014:043 For the Amalekites H6003 and the Canaanites H3669 [are] there before H6440 you, and ye shall fall H5307 (8804) by the sword H2719: because ye are turned H7725 (8804) away H0310 from the LORD H3068, therefore the LORD H3068 will not be with you.
014:044 But they presumed H6075 (8686) to go up H5927 (8800) unto the hill H2022 top H7218: nevertheless the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, and Moses H4872, departed H4185 (8804) not out H7130 of the camp H4264.
014:045 Then the Amalekites H6003 came down H3381 (8799), and the Canaanites H3669 which dwelt H3427 (8802) in that hill H2022, and smote H5221 (8686) them, and discomfited H3807 (8686) them, [even] unto Hormah H2767.
015:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
015:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When ye be come H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 of your habitations H4186, which I give H5414 (8802) unto you,
015:003 And will make H6213 (8804) an offering by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068, a burnt offering H5930, or a sacrifice H2077 in performing H6381 (8763) a vow H5088, or in a freewill offering H5071, or in your solemn feasts H4150, to make H6213 (8800) a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068, of the herd H1241, or of the flock H6629:
015:004 Then shall he that offereth H7126 (8688) his offering H7133 unto the LORD H3068 bring H7126 (8689) a meat offering H4503 of a tenth deal H6241 of flour H5560 mingled H1101 (8803) with the fourth H7243 [part] of an hin H1969 of oil H8081.
015:005 And the fourth H7243 [part] of an hin H1969 of wine H3196 for a drink offering H5262 shalt thou prepare H6213 (8799) with the burnt offering H5930 or sacrifice H2077, for one H0259 lamb H3532.
015:006 Or for a ram H0352, thou shalt prepare H6213 (8799) [for] a meat offering H4503 two H8147 tenth deals H6241 of flour H5560 mingled H1101 (8803) with the third H7992 [part] of an hin H1969 of oil H8081.
015:007 And for a drink offering H5262 thou shalt offer H7126 (8686) the third H7992 [part] of an hin H1969 of wine H3196, [for] a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
015:008 And when thou preparest H6213 (8799) a bullock H1121 H1241 [for] a burnt offering H5930, or [for] a sacrifice H2077 in performing H6381 (8763) a vow H5088, or peace offerings H8002 unto the LORD H3068:
015:009 Then shall he bring H7126 (8689) with a bullock H1241 H1121 a meat offering H4503 of three H7969 tenth deals H6241 of flour H5560 mingled H1101 (8803) with half H2677 an hin H1969 of oil H8081.
015:010 And thou shalt bring H7126 (8686) for a drink offering H5262 half H2677 an hin H1969 of wine H3196, [for] an offering made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
015:011 Thus shall it be done H6213 (8735) for one H0259 bullock H7794, or for one H0259 ram H0352, or for a lamb H3532 H7716, or a kid H5795.
015:012 According to the number H4557 that ye shall prepare H6213 (8799), so H3602 shall ye do H6213 (8799) to every one H0259 according to their number H4557.
015:013 All that are born of the country H0249 shall do H6213 (8799) these things after this manner, in offering H7126 (8687) an offering made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
015:014 And if a stranger H1616 sojourn H1481 (8799) with you, or whosoever [be] among H8432 you in your generations H1755, and will offer H6213 (8804) an offering made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068; as ye do H6213 (8799), so he shall do H6213 (8799).
015:015 One H0259 ordinance H2708 [shall be both] for you of the congregation H6951, and also for the stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) [with you], an ordinance H2708 for ever H5769 in your generations H1755: as ye [are], so shall the stranger H1616 be before H6440 the LORD H3068.
015:016 One H0259 law H8451 and one H0259 manner H4941 shall be for you, and for the stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) with you.
015:017 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
015:018 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When ye come H0935 (8800) into the land H0776 whither I bring H0935 (8688) you,
015:019 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat H0398 (8800) of the bread H3899 of the land H0776, ye shall offer up H7311 (8686) an heave offering H8641 unto the LORD H3068.
015:020 Ye shall offer up H7311 (8686) a cake H2471 of the first H7225 of your dough H6182 [for] an heave offering H8641: as [ye do] the heave offering H8641 of the threshingfloor H1637, so shall ye heave H7311 (8686) it.
015:021 Of the first H7225 of your dough H6182 ye shall give H5414 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 an heave offering H8641 in your generations H1755.
015:022 And if ye have erred H7686 (8799), and not observed H6213 (8799) all these commandments H4687, which the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) unto Moses H4872,
015:023 [Even] all that the LORD H3068 hath commanded H6680 (8765) you by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872, from the day H3117 that the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) [Moses], and henceforward H1973 among your generations H1755;
015:024 Then it shall be, if [ought] be committed H6213 (8738) by ignorance H7684 without the knowledge H5869 of the congregation H5712, that all the congregation H5712 shall offer H6213 (8804) one H0259 young H1121 H1241 bullock H6499 for a burnt offering H5930, for a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068, with his meat offering H4503, and his drink offering H5262, according to the manner H4941, and one H0259 kid H8163 of the goats H5795 for a sin offering H2403.
015:025 And the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for all the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) them; for it [is] ignorance H7684: and they shall bring H0935 (8689) their offering H7133, a sacrifice made by fire H0801 unto the LORD H3068, and their sin offering H2403 before H6440 the LORD H3068, for their ignorance H7684:
015:026 And it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) all the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and the stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) among H8432 them; seeing all the people H5971 [were] in ignorance H7684.
015:027 And if any H0259 soul H5315 sin H2398 (8799) through ignorance H7684, then he shall bring H7126 (8689) a she goat H5795 of the first H1323 year H8141 for a sin offering H2403.
015:028 And the priest H3548 shall make an atonement H3722 (8765) for the soul H5315 that sinneth ignorantly H7683 (8802), when he sinneth H2398 (8800) by ignorance H7684 before H6440 the LORD H3068, to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for him; and it shall be forgiven H5545 (8738) him.
015:029 Ye shall have one H0259 law H8451 for him that sinneth H6213 (8802) through ignorance H7684, [both for] him that is born H0249 among the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and for the stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) among H8432 them.
015:030 But the soul H5315 that doeth H6213 (8799) [ought] presumptuously H7311 (8802) H3027, [whether he be] born in the land H0249, or a stranger H4480 H1616, the same reproacheth H1442 (8764) the LORD H3068; and that soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from among H7130 his people H5971.
015:031 Because he hath despised H0959 (8804) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, and hath broken H6565 (8689) his commandment H4687, that soul H5315 shall utterly H3772 (8736) be cut off H3772 (8735); his iniquity H5771 [shall be] upon him.
015:032 And while the children H1121 of Israel H3478 were in the wilderness H4057, they found H4672 (8799) a man H0376 that gathered H7197 (8781) sticks H6086 upon the sabbath H7676 day H3117.
015:033 And they that found H4672 (8802) him gathering H7197 (8781) sticks H6086 brought H7126 (8686) him unto Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175, and unto all the congregation H5712.
015:034 And they put H3240 (8686) him in ward H4929, because it was not declared H6567 (8795) what should be done H6213 (8735) to him.
015:035 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, The man H0376 shall be surely H4191 (8800) put to death H4191 (8714): all the congregation H5712 shall stone H7275 (8800) him with stones H0068 without H2351 the camp H4264.
015:036 And all the congregation H5712 brought H3318 (8686) him without H2351 the camp H4264, and stoned H7275 (8799) him with stones H0068, and he died H4191 (8799); as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
015:037 And the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
015:038 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and bid H0559 (8804) them that they make H6213 (8804) them fringes H6734 in the borders H3671 of their garments H0899 throughout their generations H1755, and that they put H5414 (8804) upon the fringe H6734 of the borders H3671 a ribband H6616 of blue H8504:
015:039 And it shall be unto you for a fringe H6734, that ye may look H7200 (8804) upon it, and remember H2142 (8804) all the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068, and do H6213 (8804) them; and that ye seek H8446 (8799) not after H0310 your own heart H3824 and your own eyes H5869, after H0310 which ye use to go a whoring H2181 (8802):
015:040 That ye may remember H2142 (8799), and do H6213 (8804) all my commandments H4687, and be H1961 (8804) holy H6918 unto your God H0430.
015:041 I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430, which brought you out H3318 (8689) of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, to be your God H0430: I [am] the LORD H3068 your God H0430.
016:001 ¶  Now Korah H7141, the son H1121 of Izhar H3324, the son H1121 of Kohath H6955, the son H1121 of Levi H3878, and Dathan H1885 and Abiram H0048, the sons H1121 of Eliab H0446, and On H0203, the son H1121 of Peleth H6431, sons H1121 of Reuben H7205, took H3947 (8799) [men]:
016:002 And they rose up H6965 (8799) before H6440 Moses H4872, with certain H0582 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, two hundred H3967 and fifty H2572 princes H5387 of the assembly H5712, famous H7148 in the congregation H4150, men H0582 of renown H8034:
016:003 And they gathered themselves together H6950 (8735) against Moses H4872 and against Aaron H0175, and said H0559 (8799) unto them, [Ye take] too much H7227 upon you, seeing all the congregation H5712 [are] holy H6918, every one of them, and the LORD H3068 [is] among H8432 them: wherefore then lift ye up H5375 (8691) yourselves above the congregation H6951 of the LORD H3068?
016:004 And when Moses H4872 heard H8085 (8799) [it], he fell H5307 (8799) upon his face H6440:
016:005 And he spake H1696 (8762) unto Korah H7141 and unto all his company H5712, saying H0559 (8800), Even to morrow H1242 the LORD H3068 will shew H3045 (8686) who [are] his, and [who is] holy H6918; and will cause [him] to come near H7126 (8689) unto him: even [him] whom he hath chosen H0977 (8799) will he cause to come near H7126 (8686) unto him.
016:006 This do H6213 (8798); Take H3947 (8798) you censers H4289, Korah H7141, and all his company H5712;
016:007 And put H5414 (8798) fire H0784 therein H2004, and put H7760 (8798) incense H7004 in them before H6440 the LORD H3068 to morrow H4279: and it shall be [that] the man H0376 whom the LORD H3068 doth choose H0977 (8799), he [shall be] holy H6918: [ye take] too much H7227 upon you, ye sons H1121 of Levi H3878.
016:008 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto Korah H7141, Hear H8085 (8798), I pray you, ye sons H1121 of Levi H3878:
016:009 [Seemeth it but] a small thing H4592 unto you, that the God H0430 of Israel H3478 hath separated H0914 (8689) you from the congregation H5712 of Israel H3478, to bring you near H7126 (8687) to himself to do H5647 (8800) the service H5656 of the tabernacle H4908 of the LORD H3068, and to stand H5975 (8800) before H6440 the congregation H5712 to minister H8334 (8763) unto them?
016:010 And he hath brought thee near H7126 (8686) [to him], and all thy brethren H0251 the sons H1121 of Levi H3878 with thee: and seek H1245 (8765) ye the priesthood H3550 also?
016:011 For which cause H3651 [both] thou and all thy company H5712 [are] gathered together H3259 (8737) against the LORD H3068: and what [is] Aaron H0175, that ye murmur H3885 (8686) (8675) H3885 (8735) against him?
016:012 And Moses H4872 sent H7971 (8799) to call H7121 (8800) Dathan H1885 and Abiram H0048, the sons H1121 of Eliab H0446: which said H0559 (8799), We will not come up H5927 (8799):
016:013 [Is it] a small thing H4592 that H3588 thou hast brought us up H5927 (8689) out of a land H0776 that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706, to kill H4191 (8687) us in the wilderness H4057, except thou make H8323 thyself altogether H8323 (8692) a prince H8323 (8691) over us?
016:014 Moreover H0637 thou hast not brought H0935 (8689) us into a land H0776 that floweth H2100 (8802) with milk H2461 and honey H1706, or given H5414 (8799) us inheritance H5159 of fields H7704 and vineyards H3754: wilt thou put out H5365 (8762) the eyes H5869 of these men H0582? we will not come up H5927 (8799).
016:015 And Moses H4872 was very H3966 wroth H2734 (8799), and said H0559 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, Respect H6437 (8799) not thou their offering H4503: I have not taken H5375 (8804) one H0259 ass H2543 from them, neither have I hurt H7489 (8689) one H0259 of them.
016:016 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto Korah H7141, Be thou and all thy company H5712 before H6440 the LORD H3068, thou, and they, and Aaron H0175, to morrow H4279:
016:017 And take H3947 (8798) every man H0376 his censer H4289, and put H5414 (8804) incense H7004 in them, and bring H7126 (8689) ye before H6440 the LORD H3068 every man H0376 his censer H4289, two hundred H3967 and fifty H2572 censers H4289; thou also, and Aaron H0175, each H0376 [of you] his censer H4289.
016:018 And they took H3947 (8799) every man H0376 his censer H4289, and put H5414 (8799) fire H0784 in them, and laid H7760 (8799) incense H7004 thereon, and stood H5975 (8799) in the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 with Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175.
016:019 And Korah H7141 gathered H6950 (8686) all the congregation H5712 against them unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) unto all the congregation H5712.
016:020 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 and unto Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800),
016:021 Separate H0914 (8734) yourselves from among H8432 this congregation H5712, that I may consume H3615 (8762) them in a moment H7281.
016:022 And they fell H5307 (8799) upon their faces H6440, and said H0559 (8799), O God H0410, the God H0430 of the spirits H7307 of all flesh H1320, shall one H0259 man H0376 sin H2398 (8799), and wilt thou be wroth H7107 (8799) with all the congregation H5712?
016:023 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
016:024 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the congregation H5712, saying H0559 (8800), Get you up H5927 (8734) from about H5439 the tabernacle H4908 of Korah H7141, Dathan H1885, and Abiram H0048.
016:025 And Moses H4872 rose up H6965 (8799) and went H3212 (8799) unto Dathan H1885 and Abiram H0048; and the elders H2205 of Israel H3478 followed H3212 (8799) him H0310.
016:026 And he spake H1696 (8762) unto the congregation H5712, saying H0559 (8800), Depart H5493 (8798), I pray you, from the tents H0168 of these wicked H7563 men H0582, and touch H5060 (8799) nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed H5595 (8735) in all their sins H2403.
016:027 So they gat up H5927 (8735) from the tabernacle H4908 of Korah H7141, Dathan H1885, and Abiram H0048, on every side H5439: and Dathan H1885 and Abiram H0048 came out H3318 (8804), and stood H5324 (8737) in the door H6607 of their tents H0168, and their wives H0802, and their sons H1121, and their little children H2945.
016:028 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799), Hereby ye shall know H3045 (8799) that the LORD H3068 hath sent H7971 (8804) me to do H6213 (8800) all these works H4639; for [I have] not [done them] of mine own mind H3820.
016:029 If these men die H4191 (8799) the common death H4194 of all men H0120, or if they be visited H6485 (8735) after the visitation H6486 of all men H0120; [then] the LORD H3068 hath not sent H7971 (8804) me.
016:030 But if the LORD H3068 make H1254 (8799) a new thing H1278, and the earth H0127 open H6475 (8804) her mouth H6310, and swallow them up H1104 (8804), with all that [appertain] unto them, and they go down H3381 (8804) quick H2416 into the pit H7585; then ye shall understand H3045 (8804) that these men H0582 have provoked H5006 (8765) the LORD H3068.
016:031 And it came to pass, as he had made an end H3615 (8763) of speaking H1696 (8763) all these words H1697, that the ground H0127 clave asunder H1234 (8735) that [was] under them:
016:032 And the earth H0776 opened H6605 (8799) her mouth H6310, and swallowed them up H1104 (8799), and their houses H1004, and all the men H0120 that [appertained] unto Korah H7141, and all [their] goods H7399.
016:033 They, and all that [appertained] to them, went down H3381 (8799) alive H2416 into the pit H7585, and the earth H0776 closed H3680 (8762) upon them: and they perished H0006 (8799) from among H8432 the congregation H6951.
016:034 And all Israel H3478 that [were] round about H5439 them fled H5127 (8804) at the cry H6963 of them: for they said H0559 (8804), Lest the earth H0776 swallow us up H1104 (8799) [also].
016:035 And there came out H3318 (8804) a fire H0784 from the LORD H3068, and consumed H0398 (8799) the two hundred H3967 and fifty H2572 men H0376 that offered H7126 (8688) incense H7004.
016:036 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
016:037 Speak H0559 (8798) unto Eleazar H0499 the son H1121 of Aaron H0175 the priest H3548, that he take up H7311 (8686) the censers H4289 out H0996 of the burning H8316, and scatter H2219 (8798) thou the fire H0784 yonder H1973; for they are hallowed H6942 (8804).
016:038 The censers H4289 of these sinners H2400 against their own souls H5315, let them make H6213 (8804) them broad H7555 plates H6341 [for] a covering H6826 of the altar H4196: for they offered H7126 (8689) them before H6440 the LORD H3068, therefore they are hallowed H6942 (8799): and they shall be a sign H0226 unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
016:039 And Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548 took H3947 (8799) the brasen H5178 censers H4289, wherewith they that were burnt H8313 (8803) had offered H7126 (8689); and they were made broad H7554 (8762) [plates for] a covering H6826 of the altar H4196:
016:040 [To be] a memorial H2146 unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that H0834 H4616 no stranger H0376 H2114 (8801), which [is] not of the seed H2233 of Aaron H0175, come near H7126 (8799) to offer H6999 (8687) incense H7004 before H6440 the LORD H3068; that he be not as Korah H7141, and as his company H5712: as the LORD H3068 said H1696 (8765) to him by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
016:041 But on the morrow H4283 all the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 murmured H3885 (8735) against Moses H4872 and against Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800), Ye have killed H4191 (8689) the people H5971 of the LORD H3068.
016:042 And it came to pass, when the congregation H5712 was gathered H6950 (8736) against Moses H4872 and against Aaron H0175, that they looked H6437 (8799) toward the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and, behold, the cloud H6051 covered H3680 (8765) it, and the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735).
016:043 And Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175 came H0935 (8799) before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
016:044 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
016:045 Get you up H7426 (8734) from among H8432 this congregation H5712, that I may consume H3615 (8762) them as in a moment H7281. And they fell H5307 (8799) upon their faces H6440.
016:046 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto Aaron H0175, Take H3947 (8798) a censer H4289, and put H5414 (8798) fire H0784 therein from off H6440 the altar H4196, and put H7760 (8798) on incense H7004, and go H3212 (8685) quickly H4120 unto the congregation H5712, and make an atonement H3722 (8761) for them: for there is wrath H7110 gone out H3318 (8804) from the LORD H3068; the plague H5063 is begun H2490 (8689).
016:047 And Aaron H0175 took H3947 (8799) as Moses H4872 commanded H1696 (8765), and ran H7323 (8799) into the midst H8432 of the congregation H6951; and, behold, the plague H5063 was begun H2490 (8689) among the people H5971: and he put H5414 (8799) on incense H7004, and made an atonement H3722 (8762) for the people H5971.
016:048 And he stood H5975 (8799) between the dead H4191 (8801) and the living H2416; and the plague H4046 was stayed H6113 (8735).
016:049 Now they that died H4191 (8801) in the plague H4046 were fourteen H0702 H6240 thousand H0505 and seven H7651 hundred H3967, beside them that died H4191 (8801) about the matter H1697 of Korah H7141.
016:050 And Aaron H0175 returned H7725 (8799) unto Moses H4872 unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150: and the plague H4046 was stayed H6113 (8738).
017:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
017:002 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and take H3947 (8798) of every one of them a rod H4294 H4294 according to the house H1004 of [their] fathers H0001, of all their princes H5387 according to the house H1004 of their fathers H0001 twelve H8147 H6240 rods H4294: write H3789 (8799) thou every man’s H0376 name H8034 upon his rod H4294.
017:003 And thou shalt write H3789 (8799) Aaron’s H0175 name H8034 upon the rod H4294 of Levi H3878: for one H0259 rod H4294 [shall be] for the head H7218 of the house H1004 of their fathers H0001.
017:004 And thou shalt lay them up H3240 (8689) in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 before H6440 the testimony H5715, where I will meet H3259 (8735) with you.
017:005 And it shall come to pass, [that] the man’s H0376 rod H4294, whom I shall choose H0977 (8799), shall blossom H6524 (8799): and I will make to cease H7918 (8689) from me the murmurings H8519 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, whereby they murmur H3885 (8688) against you.
017:006 And Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8762) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and every one of their princes H5387 gave H5414 (8799) him a rod H4294 H4294 apiece, for each prince H5387 H5387 one H0259 H0259, according to their fathers H0001 ’ houses H1004, [even] twelve H6240 H8147 rods H4294: and the rod H4294 of Aaron H0175 [was] among H8432 their rods H4294.
017:007 And Moses H4872 laid up H3240 (8686) the rods H4294 before H6440 the LORD H3068 in the tabernacle H0168 of witness H5715.
017:008 And it came to pass, that on the morrow H4283 Moses H4872 went H0935 (8799) into the tabernacle H0168 of witness H5715; and, behold, the rod H4294 of Aaron H0175 for the house H1004 of Levi H3878 was budded H6524 (8804), and brought forth H3318 (8686) buds H6525, and bloomed H6692 (8686) blossoms H6731, and yielded H1580 (8799) almonds H8247.
017:009 And Moses H4872 brought out H3318 (8686) all the rods H4294 from before H6440 the LORD H3068 unto all the children H1121 of Israel H3478: and they looked H7200 (8799), and took H3947 (8799) every man H0376 his rod H4294.
017:010 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Bring H7725 Aaron’s H0175 rod H4294 again H7725 (8685) before H6440 the testimony H5715, to be kept H4931 for a token H0226 against the rebels H4805 H1121; and thou shalt quite take away H3615 (8762) their murmurings H8519 from me, that they die H4191 (8799) not.
017:011 And Moses H4872 did H6213 (8799) [so]: as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) him, so did H6213 (8804) he.
017:012 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 spake H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, we die H1478 (8804), we perish H0006 (8804), we all perish H0006 (8804).
017:013 Whosoever cometh any thing near H7131 unto the tabernacle H4908 of the LORD H3068 shall die H4191 (8799): shall we be consumed H8552 (8804) with dying H1478 (8800)?
018:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Aaron H0175, Thou and thy sons H1121 and thy father’s H0001 house H1004 with thee shall bear H5375 (8799) the iniquity H5771 of the sanctuary H4720: and thou and thy sons H1121 with thee shall bear H5375 (8799) the iniquity H5771 of your priesthood H3550.
018:002 And thy brethren H0251 also of the tribe H4294 of Levi H3878, the tribe H7626 of thy father H0001, bring H7126 (8685) thou with thee, that they may be joined H3867 (8735) unto thee, and minister H8334 (8762) unto thee: but thou and thy sons H1121 with thee [shall minister] before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of witness H5715.
018:003 And they shall keep H8104 (8804) thy charge H4931, and the charge H4931 of all the tabernacle H0168: only they shall not come nigh H7126 (8799) the vessels H3627 of the sanctuary H6944 and the altar H4196, that neither they, nor ye also, die H4191 (8799).
018:004 And they shall be joined H3867 (8738) unto thee, and keep H8104 (8804) the charge H4931 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, for all the service H5656 of the tabernacle H0168: and a stranger H2114 (8801) shall not come nigh H7126 (8799) unto you.
018:005 And ye shall keep H8104 (8804) the charge H4931 of the sanctuary H6944, and the charge H4931 of the altar H4196: that there be no wrath H7110 any more upon the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
018:006 And I, behold, I have taken H3947 (8804) your brethren H0251 the Levites H3881 from among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478: to you [they are] given H5414 (8803) [as] a gift H4979 for the LORD H3068, to do H5647 (8800) the service H5656 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
018:007 Therefore thou and thy sons H1121 with thee shall keep H8104 (8799) your priest’s office H3550 for every thing H1697 of the altar H4196, and within H1004 the vail H6532; and ye shall serve H5647 (8804): I have given H5414 (8799) your priest’s office H3550 [unto you] as a service H5656 of gift H4979: and the stranger H2114 (8801) that cometh nigh H7131 shall be put to death H4191 (8714).
018:008 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Aaron H0175, Behold, I also have given H5414 (8804) thee the charge H4931 of mine heave offerings H8641 of all the hallowed things H6944 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478; unto thee have I given H5414 (8804) them by reason of the anointing H4888, and to thy sons H1121, by an ordinance H2706 for ever H5769.
018:009 This shall be thine of the most H6944 holy things H6944, [reserved] from the fire H0784: every oblation H7133 of theirs, every meat offering H4503 of theirs, and every sin offering H2403 of theirs, and every trespass offering H0817 of theirs, which they shall render H7725 (8686) unto me, [shall be] most H6944 holy H6944 for thee and for thy sons H1121.
018:010 In the most H6944 holy H6944 [place] shalt thou eat H0398 (8799) it; every male H2145 shall eat H0398 (8799) it: it shall be holy H6944 unto thee.
018:011 And this [is] thine; the heave offering H8641 of their gift H4976, with all the wave offerings H8573 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478: I have given H5414 (8804) them unto thee, and to thy sons H1121 and to thy daughters H1323 with thee, by a statute H2706 for ever H5769: every one that is clean H2889 in thy house H1004 shall eat H0398 (8799) of it.
018:012 All the best H2459 of the oil H3323, and all the best H2459 of the wine H8492, and of the wheat H1715, the firstfruits H7225 of them which they shall offer H5414 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, them have I given H5414 (8804) thee.
018:013 [And] whatsoever is first ripe H1061 in the land H0776, which they shall bring H0935 (8686) unto the LORD H3068, shall be thine; every one that is clean H2889 in thine house H1004 shall eat H0398 (8799) [of] it.
018:014 Every thing devoted H2764 in Israel H3478 shall be thine.
018:015 Every thing that openeth H6363 the matrix H7358 in all flesh H1320, which they bring H7126 (8686) unto the LORD H3068, [whether it be] of men H0120 or beasts H0929, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn H1060 of man H0120 shalt thou surely H6299 (8800) redeem H6299 (8799), and the firstling H1060 of unclean H2931 beasts H0929 shalt thou redeem H6299 (8799).
018:016 And those that are to be redeemed H6299 (8803) from a month H2320 old H1121 shalt thou redeem H6299 (8799), according to thine estimation H6187, for the money H3701 of five H2568 shekels H8255, after the shekel H8255 of the sanctuary H6944, which [is] twenty H6242 gerahs H1626.
018:017 But the firstling H1060 of a cow H7794, or the firstling H1060 of a sheep H3775, or the firstling H1060 of a goat H5795, thou shalt not redeem H6299 (8799); they [are] holy H6944: thou shalt sprinkle H2236 (8799) their blood H1818 upon the altar H4196, and shalt burn H6999 (8686) their fat H2459 [for] an offering made by fire H0801, for a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.
018:018 And the flesh H1320 of them shall be thine, as the wave H8573 breast H2373 and as the right H3225 shoulder H7785 are thine.
018:019 All the heave offerings H8641 of the holy things H6944, which the children H1121 of Israel H3478 offer H7311 (8686) unto the LORD H3068, have I given H5414 (8804) thee, and thy sons H1121 and thy daughters H1323 with thee, by a statute H2706 for ever H5769: it [is] a covenant H1285 of salt H4417 for ever H5769 before H6440 the LORD H3068 unto thee and to thy seed H2233 with thee.
018:020 And the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto Aaron H0175, Thou shalt have no inheritance H5157 (8799) in their land H0776, neither shalt thou have any part H2506 among H8432 them: I [am] thy part H2506 and thine inheritance H5159 among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
018:021 And, behold, I have given H5414 (8804) the children H1121 of Levi H3878 all the tenth H4643 in Israel H3478 for an inheritance H5159, for H2500 their service H5656 which they serve H5647 (8802), [even] the service H5656 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
018:022 Neither must the children H1121 of Israel H3478 henceforth H5750 come nigh H7126 (8799) the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, lest they bear H5375 (8800) sin H2399, and die H4191 (8800).
018:023 But the Levites H3881 shall do H5647 (8804) the service H5656 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and they shall bear H5375 (8799) their iniquity H5771: [it shall be] a statute H2708 for ever H5769 throughout your generations H1755, that among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 they have H5157 (8799) no inheritance H5159.
018:024 But the tithes H4643 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, which they offer H7311 (8686) [as] an heave offering H8641 unto the LORD H3068, I have given H5414 (8804) to the Levites H3881 to inherit H5159: therefore I have said H0559 (8804) unto them, Among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 they shall have H5157 (8799) no inheritance H5159.
018:025 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
018:026 Thus speak H1696 (8762) unto the Levites H3881, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When ye take H3947 (8799) of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 the tithes H4643 which I have given H5414 (8804) you from them for your inheritance H5159, then ye shall offer H7311 (8689) up an heave offering H8641 of it for the LORD H3068, [even] a tenth H4643 [part] of the tithe H4643.
018:027 And [this] your heave offering H8641 shall be reckoned H2803 (8738) unto you, as though [it were] the corn H1715 of the threshingfloor H1637, and as the fulness H4395 of the winepress H3342.
018:028 Thus ye also shall offer H7311 (8686) an heave offering H8641 unto the LORD H3068 of all your tithes H4643, which ye receive H3947 (8799) of the children H1121 of Israel H3478; and ye shall give H5414 (8804) thereof the LORD’S H3068 heave offering H8641 to Aaron H0175 the priest H3548.
018:029 Out of all your gifts H4979 ye shall offer H7311 (8686) every heave offering H8641 of the LORD H3068, of all the best H2459 thereof, [even] the hallowed part H4720 thereof out of it.
018:030 Therefore thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, When ye have heaved H7311 (8687) the best H2459 thereof from it, then it shall be counted H2803 (8738) unto the Levites H3881 as the increase H8393 of the threshingfloor H1637, and as the increase H8393 of the winepress H3342.
018:031 And ye shall eat H0398 (8804) it in every place H4725, ye and your households H1004: for it [is] your reward H7939 for H2500 your service H5656 in the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
018:032 And ye shall bear H5375 (8799) no sin H2399 by reason of it, when ye have heaved H7311 (8687) from it the best H2459 of it: neither shall ye pollute H2490 (8762) the holy things H6944 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, lest ye die H4191 (8799).
019:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 and unto Aaron H0175, saying H0559 (8800),
019:002 This [is] the ordinance H2708 of the law H8451 which the LORD H3068 hath commanded H6680 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that they bring H3947 (8799) thee a red H0122 heifer H6510 without spot H8549, wherein [is] no blemish H3971, [and] upon which never H3808 came H5927 (8804) yoke H5923:
019:003 And ye shall give H5414 (8804) her unto Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, that he may bring her forth H3318 (8689) without H2351 the camp H4264, and [one] shall slay H7819 (8804) her before H6440 his face:
019:004 And Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) of her blood H1818 with his finger H0676, and sprinkle H5137 (8689) of her blood H1818 directly H5227 before H6440 the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150 seven H7651 times H6471:
019:005 And [one] shall burn H8313 (8804) the heifer H6510 in his sight H5869; her skin H5785, and her flesh H1320, and her blood H1818, with her dung H6569, shall he burn H8313 (8799):
019:006 And the priest H3548 shall take H3947 (8804) cedar H0730 wood H6086, and hyssop H0231, and scarlet H8438 H8144, and cast H7993 (8689) [it] into the midst H8432 of the burning H8316 of the heifer H6510.
019:007 Then the priest H3548 shall wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and he shall bathe H7364 (8804) his flesh H1320 in water H4325, and afterward H0310 he shall come H0935 (8799) into the camp H4264, and the priest H3548 shall be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
019:008 And he that burneth H8313 (8802) her shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899 in water H4325, and bathe H7364 (8804) his flesh H1320 in water H4325, and shall be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153.
019:009 And a man H0376 [that is] clean H2889 shall gather H0622 (8804) up the ashes H0665 of the heifer H6510, and lay [them] up H3240 (8689) without H2351 the camp H4264 in a clean H2889 place H4725, and it shall be kept H4931 for the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 for a water H4325 of separation H5079: it [is] a purification for sin H2403.
019:010 And he that gathereth H0622 (8802) the ashes H0665 of the heifer H6510 shall wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and be unclean H2930 (8804) until the even H6153: and it shall be unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and unto the stranger H1616 that sojourneth H1481 (8802) among H8432 them, for a statute H2708 for ever H5769.
019:011 He that toucheth H5060 (8802) the dead H4191 (8801) body H5315 of any man H0120 shall be unclean H2930 (8804) seven H7651 days H3117.
019:012 He shall purify H2398 (8691) himself with it on the third H7992 day H3117, and on the seventh H7637 day H3117 he shall be clean H2891 (8799): but if he purify H2398 (8691) not himself the third H7992 day H3117, then the seventh H7637 day H3117 he shall not be clean H2891 (8799).
019:013 Whosoever toucheth H5060 (8802) the dead H4191 (8801) body H5315 of any man H0120 that is dead H4191 (8799), and purifieth H2398 (8691) not himself, defileth H2930 (8765) the tabernacle H4908 of the LORD H3068; and that soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from Israel H3478: because the water H4325 of separation H5079 was not sprinkled H2236 (8795) upon him, he shall be unclean H2931; his uncleanness H2932 [is] yet upon him.
019:014 This [is] the law H8451, when a man H0120 dieth H4191 (8799) in a tent H0168: all that come H0935 (8802) into the tent H0168, and all that [is] in the tent H0168, shall be unclean H2930 (8799) seven H7651 days H3117.
019:015 And every open H6605 (8803) vessel H3627, which hath no covering H6781 bound H6616 upon it, [is] unclean H2931.
019:016 And whosoever toucheth H5060 (8799) one that is slain H2491 with a sword H2719 in the open H6440 fields H7704, or a dead body H4191 (8801), or a bone H6106 of a man H0120, or a grave H6913, shall be unclean H2930 (8799) seven H7651 days H3117.
019:017 And for an unclean H2931 [person] they shall take H3947 (8804) of the ashes H6083 of the burnt heifer H8316 of purification for sin H2403, and running H2416 water H4325 shall be put H5414 (8804) thereto in a vessel H3627:
019:018 And a clean H2889 person H0376 shall take H3947 (8804) hyssop H0231, and dip H2881 (8804) [it] in the water H4325, and sprinkle H5137 (8689) [it] upon the tent H0168, and upon all the vessels H3627, and upon the persons H5315 that were there, and upon him that touched H5060 (8802) a bone H6106, or one slain H2491, or one dead H4191 (8801), or a grave H6913:
019:019 And the clean H2889 [person] shall sprinkle H5137 (8689) upon the unclean H2931 on the third H7992 day H3117, and on the seventh H7637 day H3117: and on the seventh H7637 day H3117 he shall purify H2398 (8765) himself, and wash H3526 (8765) his clothes H0899, and bathe H7364 (8804) himself in water H4325, and shall be clean H2891 (8804) at even H6153.
019:020 But the man H0376 that shall be unclean H2930 (8799), and shall not purify H2398 (8691) himself, that soul H5315 shall be cut off H3772 (8738) from among H8432 the congregation H6951, because he hath defiled H2930 (8765) the sanctuary H4720 of the LORD H3068: the water H4325 of separation H5079 hath not been sprinkled H2236 (8795) upon him; he [is] unclean H2931.
019:021 And it shall be a perpetual H5769 statute H2708 unto them, that he that sprinkleth H5137 (8688) the water H4325 of separation H5079 shall wash H3526 (8762) his clothes H0899; and he that toucheth H5060 (8802) the water H4325 of separation H5079 shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until even H6153.
019:022 And whatsoever the unclean H2931 [person] toucheth H5060 (8799) shall be unclean H2930 (8799); and the soul H5315 that toucheth H5060 (8802) [it] shall be unclean H2930 (8799) until even H6153.
020:001 ¶  Then came H0935 (8799) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, [even] the whole congregation H5712, into the desert H4057 of Zin H6790 in the first H7223 month H2320: and the people H5971 abode H3427 (8799) in Kadesh H6946; and Miriam H4813 died H4191 (8799) there, and was buried H6912 (8735) there.
020:002 And there was no water H4325 for the congregation H5712: and they gathered H6950 (8735) themselves together against Moses H4872 and against Aaron H0175.
020:003 And the people H5971 chode H7378 (8799) with Moses H4872, and spake H0559 (8799), saying H0559 (8800), Would God that H3863 we had died H1478 (8804) when our brethren H0251 died H1478 (8800) before H6440 the LORD H3068!
020:004 And why have ye brought up H0935 (8689) the congregation H6951 of the LORD H3068 into this wilderness H4057, that we and our cattle H1165 should die H4191 (8800) there?
020:005 And wherefore have ye made us to come up H5927 (8689) out of Egypt H4714, to bring H0935 (8687) us in unto this evil H7451 place H4725? it [is] no place H4725 of seed H2233, or of figs H8384, or of vines H1612, or of pomegranates H7416; neither [is] there any water H4325 to drink H8354 (8800).
020:006 And Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175 went H0935 (8799) from the presence H6440 of the assembly H6951 unto the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and they fell H5307 (8799) upon their faces H6440: and the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 appeared H7200 (8735) unto them.
020:007 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
020:008 Take H3947 (8798) the rod H4294, and gather H6950 (8685) thou the assembly H5712 together, thou, and Aaron H0175 thy brother H0251, and speak H1696 (8765) ye unto the rock H5553 before their eyes H5869; and it shall give forth H5414 (8804) his water H4325, and thou shalt bring forth H3318 (8689) to them water H4325 out of the rock H5553: so thou shalt give H8248 the congregation H5712 and their beasts H1165 drink H8248 (8689).
020:009 And Moses H4872 took H3947 (8799) the rod H4294 from before H6440 the LORD H3068, as he commanded H6680 (8765) him.
020:010 And Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175 gathered H6950 (8686) the congregation H6951 together before H6440 the rock H5553, and he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Hear H8085 (8798) now, ye rebels H4784 (8802); must we fetch H3318 (8686) you water H4325 out of this rock H5553?
020:011 And Moses H4872 lifted up H7311 (8686) his hand H3027, and with his rod H4294 he smote H5221 (8686) the rock H5553 twice H6471: and the water H4325 came out H3318 (8799) abundantly H7227, and the congregation H5712 drank H8354 (8799), and their beasts H1165 [also].
020:012 And the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175, Because ye believed H0539 (8689) me not, to sanctify H6942 (8687) me in the eyes H5869 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, therefore ye shall not bring H0935 (8686) this congregation H6951 into the land H0776 which I have given H5414 (8804) them.
020:013 This [is] H1992 the water H4325 of Meribah H4809; because the children H1121 of Israel H3478 strove H7378 (8804) with the LORD H3068, and he was sanctified H6942 (8735) in them.
020:014 And Moses H4872 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 from Kadesh H6946 unto the king H4428 of Edom H0123, Thus saith H0559 (8804) thy brother H0251 Israel H3478, Thou knowest H3045 (8804) all the travail H8513 that hath befallen H4672 (8804) us:
020:015 How our fathers H0001 went down H3381 (8799) into Egypt H4714, and we have dwelt H3427 (8799) in Egypt H4714 a long H7227 time H3117; and the Egyptians H4714 vexed H7489 (8686) us, and our fathers H0001:
020:016 And when we cried H6817 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, he heard H8085 (8799) our voice H6963, and sent H7971 (8799) an angel H4397, and hath brought us forth H3318 (8686) out of Egypt H4714: and, behold, we [are] in Kadesh H6946, a city H5892 in the uttermost H7097 of thy border H1366:
020:017 Let us pass H5674 (8799), I pray thee, through thy country H0776: we will not pass H5674 (8799) through the fields H7704, or through the vineyards H3754, neither will we drink H8354 (8799) [of] the water H4325 of the wells H0875: we will go H3212 (8799) by the king’s H4428 [high] way H1870, we will not turn H5186 (8799) to the right hand H3225 nor to the left H8040, until we have passed H5674 (8799) thy borders H1366.
020:018 And Edom H0123 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thou shalt not pass H5674 (8799) by me, lest I come out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) thee with the sword H2719.
020:019 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 said H0559 (8799) unto him, We will go H5927 (8799) by the high way H4546: and if I and my cattle H4735 drink H8354 (8799) of thy water H4325, then I will pay H5414 (8804) H4377 for it: I will only, without [doing] any thing H1697 [else], go through H5674 (8799) on my feet H7272.
020:020 And he said H0559 (8799), Thou shalt not go through H5674 (8799). And Edom H0123 came out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) him with much H3515 people H5971, and with a strong H2389 hand H3027.
020:021 Thus Edom H0123 refused H3985 (8762) to give H5414 (8800) Israel H3478 passage H5674 (8800) through his border H1366: wherefore Israel H3478 turned away H5186 (8799) from him.
020:022 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478, [even] the whole congregation H5712, journeyed H5265 (8799) from Kadesh H6946, and came H0935 (8799) unto mount H2022 Hor H2023.
020:023 And the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175 in mount H2022 Hor H2023, by the coast H1366 of the land H0776 of Edom H0123, saying H0559 (8800),
020:024 Aaron H0175 shall be gathered H0622 (8735) unto his people H5971: for he shall not enter H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 which I have given H5414 (8804) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, because ye rebelled against H4784 (8804) my word H6310 at the water H4325 of Meribah H4809.
020:025 Take H3947 (8798) Aaron H0175 and Eleazar H0499 his son H1121, and bring them up H5927 (8685) unto mount H2022 Hor H2023:
020:026 And strip H6584 (8685) Aaron H0175 of his garments H0899, and put H3847 (8689) them upon Eleazar H0499 his son H1121: and Aaron H0175 shall be gathered H0622 (8735) [unto his people], and shall die H4191 (8804) there.
020:027 And Moses H4872 did H6213 (8799) as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765): and they went up H5927 (8799) into mount H2022 Hor H2023 in the sight H5869 of all the congregation H5712.
020:028 And Moses H4872 stripped H6584 (8686) Aaron H0175 of his garments H0899, and put H3847 (8686) them upon Eleazar H0499 his son H1121; and Aaron H0175 died H4191 (8799) there in the top H7218 of the mount H2022: and Moses H4872 and Eleazar H0499 came down H3381 (8799) from the mount H2022.
020:029 And when all the congregation H5712 saw H7200 (8799) that Aaron H0175 was dead H1478 (8804), they mourned H1058 (8799) for Aaron H0175 thirty H7970 days H3117, [even] all the house H1004 of Israel H3478.
021:001 ¶  And [when] king H4428 Arad H6166 the Canaanite H3669, which dwelt H3427 (8802) in the south H5045, heard H8085 (8799) tell that Israel H3478 came H0935 (8802) by the way H1870 of the spies H0871; then he fought H3898 (8735) against Israel H3478, and took H7617 (8799) [some] of them prisoners H7628.
021:002 And Israel H3478 vowed H5087 (8799) a vow H5088 unto the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), If thou wilt indeed H5414 (8800) deliver H5414 (8799) this people H5971 into my hand H3027, then I will utterly destroy H2763 (8689) their cities H5892.
021:003 And the LORD H3068 hearkened H8085 (8799) to the voice H6963 of Israel H3478, and delivered up H5414 (8799) the Canaanites H3669; and they utterly destroyed H2763 (8686) them and their cities H5892: and he called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the place H4725 Hormah H2767.
021:004 And they journeyed H5265 (8799) from mount H2022 Hor H2023 by the way H1870 of the Red H5488 sea H3220, to compass H5437 (8800) the land H0776 of Edom H0123: and the soul H5315 of the people H5971 was much discouraged H7114 (8799) because of the way H1870.
021:005 And the people H5971 spake H1696 (8762) against God H0430, and against Moses H4872, Wherefore have ye brought us up H5927 (8689) out of Egypt H4714 to die H4191 (8800) in the wilderness H4057? for [there is] no bread H3899, neither [is there any] water H4325; and our soul H5315 loatheth H6973 (8804) this light H7052 bread H3899.
021:006 And the LORD H3068 sent H7971 (8762) fiery H8314 serpents H5175 among the people H5971, and they bit H5391 (8762) the people H5971; and much H7227 people H5971 of Israel H3478 died H4191 (8799).
021:007 Therefore the people H5971 came H0935 (8799) to Moses H4872, and said H0559 (8799), We have sinned H2398 (8804), for we have spoken H1696 (8765) against the LORD H3068, and against thee; pray H6419 (8690) unto the LORD H3068, that he take away H5493 (8686) the serpents H5175 from us. And Moses H4872 prayed H6419 (8691) for the people H5971.
021:008 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Make H6213 (8798) thee a fiery serpent H8314, and set H7760 (8798) it upon a pole H5251: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten H5391 (8803), when he looketh H7200 (8804) upon it, shall live H2425 (8804).
021:009 And Moses H4872 made H6213 (8799) a serpent H5175 of brass H5178, and put H7760 (8799) it upon a pole H5251, and it came to pass, that if a serpent H5175 had bitten H5391 (8804) any man H0376, when he beheld H5027 (8689) the serpent H5175 of brass H5178, he lived H2425 (8804).
021:010 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 set forward H5265 (8799), and pitched H2583 (8799) in Oboth H0088.
021:011 And they journeyed H5265 (8799) from Oboth H0088, and pitched H2583 (8799) at Ijeabarim H5863, in the wilderness H4057 which [is] before H6440 Moab H4124, toward the sunrising H4217 H8121.
021:012 From thence they removed H5265 (8804), and pitched H2583 (8799) in the valley H5158 of Zared H2218.
021:013 From thence they removed H5265 (8804), and pitched H2583 (8799) on the other side H5676 of Arnon H0769, which [is] in the wilderness H4057 that cometh out H3318 (8802) of the coasts H1366 of the Amorites H0567: for Arnon H0769 [is] the border H1366 of Moab H4124, between Moab H4124 and the Amorites H0567.
021:014 Wherefore it is said H0559 (8735) in the book H5612 of the wars H4421 of the LORD H3068, What he did H2052 in the Red sea H5492, and in the brooks H5158 of Arnon H0769,
021:015 And at the stream H0793 of the brooks H5158 that goeth down H5186 (8804) to the dwelling H3427 (8800) of Ar H6144, and lieth H8172 (8738) upon the border H1366 of Moab H4124.
021:016 And from thence [they went] to Beer H0876: that [is] the well H0875 whereof the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8804) unto Moses H4872, Gather H0622 the people H5971 together H0622 (8798), and I will give H5414 (8799) them water H4325.
021:017 Then Israel H3478 sang H7891 (8799) this song H7892, Spring up H5927 (8798), O well H0875; sing H6030 (8798) ye unto it:
021:018 The princes H8269 digged H2658 (8804) the well H0875, the nobles H5081 of the people H5971 digged H3738 (8804) it, by [the direction of] the lawgiver H2710 (8781), with their staves H4938. And from the wilderness H4057 [they went] to Mattanah H4980:
021:019 And from Mattanah H4980 to Nahaliel H5160: and from Nahaliel H5160 to Bamoth H1120:
021:020 And from Bamoth H1120 [in] the valley H1516, that [is] in the country H7704 of Moab H4124, to the top H7218 of Pisgah H6449, which looketh H8259 (8738) toward H6440 Jeshimon H3452.
021:021 And Israel H3478 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 unto Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, saying H0559 (8800),
021:022 Let me pass H5674 (8799) through thy land H0776: we will not turn H5186 (8799) into the fields H7704, or into the vineyards H3754; we will not drink H8354 (8799) [of] the waters H4325 of the well H0875: [but] we will go along H3212 (8799) by the king’s H4428 [high] way H1870, until we be past H5674 (8799) thy borders H1366.
021:023 And Sihon H5511 would not suffer H5414 (8804) Israel H3478 to pass H5674 (8800) through his border H1366: but Sihon H5511 gathered H0622 all his people H5971 together H0622 (8799), and went out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) Israel H3478 into the wilderness H4057: and he came H0935 (8799) to Jahaz H3096, and fought H3898 (8735) against Israel H3478.
021:024 And Israel H3478 smote H5221 (8686) him with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719, and possessed H3423 (8799) his land H0776 from Arnon H0769 unto Jabbok H2999, even unto the children H1121 of Ammon H5983: for the border H1366 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 [was] strong H5794.
021:025 And Israel H3478 took H3947 (8799) all these cities H5892: and Israel H3478 dwelt H3427 (8799) in all the cities H5892 of the Amorites H0567, in Heshbon H2809, and in all the villages H1323 thereof.
021:026 For Heshbon H2809 [was] the city H5892 of Sihon H5511 the king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, who had fought H3898 (8738) against the former H7223 king H4428 of Moab H4124, and taken H3947 (8799) all his land H0776 out of his hand H3027, even unto Arnon H0769.
021:027 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs H4911 (8802) say H0559 (8799), Come H0935 (8798) into Heshbon H2809, let the city H5892 of Sihon H5511 be built H1129 (8735) and prepared H3559 (8709):
021:028 For there is a fire H0784 gone out H3318 (8804) of Heshbon H2809, a flame H3852 from the city H7151 of Sihon H5511: it hath consumed H0398 (8804) Ar H6144 of Moab H4124, [and] the lords of the high places H1181 of Arnon H0769.
021:029 Woe H0188 to thee, Moab H4124! thou art undone H0006 (8804), O people H5971 of Chemosh H3645: he hath given H5414 (8804) his sons H1121 that escaped H6412, and his daughters H1323, into captivity H7622 unto Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567.
021:030 We have shot H3384 (8799) at them; Heshbon H2809 is perished H0006 (8804) even unto Dibon H1769, and we have laid them waste H8074 (8686) even unto Nophah H5302, which [reacheth] unto Medeba H4311.
021:031 Thus Israel H3478 dwelt H3427 (8799) in the land H0776 of the Amorites H0567.
021:032 And Moses H4872 sent H7971 (8799) to spy out H7270 (8763) Jaazer H3270, and they took H3920 (8799) the villages H1323 thereof, and drove out H3423 (8686) (8675) H3423 (8799) the Amorites H0567 that [were] there.
021:033 And they turned H6437 (8799) and went up H5927 (8799) by the way H1870 of Bashan H1316: and Og H5747 the king H4428 of Bashan H1316 went out H3318 (8799) against H7125 (8800) them, he, and all his people H5971, to the battle H4421 at Edrei H0154.
021:034 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Fear H3372 (8799) him not: for I have delivered H5414 (8804) him into thy hand H3027, and all his people H5971, and his land H0776; and thou shalt do H6213 (8804) to him as thou didst H6213 (8804) unto Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, which dwelt H3427 (8802) at Heshbon H2809.
021:035 So they smote H5221 (8686) him, and his sons H1121, and all his people H5971, until there was none H1115 left H7604 (8689) him alive H8300: and they possessed H3423 (8799) his land H0776.
022:001 ¶  And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 set forward H5265 (8799), and pitched H2583 (8799) in the plains H6160 of Moab H4124 on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 [by] Jericho H3405.
022:002 And Balak H1111 the son H1121 of Zippor H6834 saw H7200 (8799) all that Israel H3478 had done H6213 (8804) to the Amorites H0567.
022:003 And Moab H4124 was sore H3966 afraid H1481 (8799) of H6440 the people H5971, because they [were] many H7227: and Moab H4124 was distressed H6973 (8799) because of H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
022:004 And Moab H4124 said H0559 (8799) unto the elders H2205 of Midian H4080, Now shall this company H6951 lick up H3897 (8762) all [that are] round about H5439 us, as the ox H7794 licketh up H3897 (8800) the grass H3418 of the field H7704. And Balak H1111 the son H1121 of Zippor H6834 [was] king H4428 of the Moabites H4124 at that time H6256.
022:005 He sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 therefore unto Balaam H1109 the son H1121 of Beor H1160 to Pethor H6604, which [is] by the river H5104 of the land H0776 of the children H1121 of his people H5971, to call H7121 (8800) him, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, there is a people H5971 come out H3318 (8804) from Egypt H4714: behold, they cover H3680 (8765) the face H5869 of the earth H0776, and they abide H3427 (8802) over against H4136 me:
022:006 Come H3212 (8798) now therefore, I pray thee, curse H0779 (8798) me this people H5971; for they [are] too mighty H6099 for me: peradventure I shall prevail H3201 (8799), [that] we may smite H5221 (8686) them, and [that] I may drive them out H1644 (8762) of the land H0776: for I wot H3045 (8804) that he whom thou blessest H1288 (8762) [is] blessed H1288 (8794), and he whom thou cursest H0779 (8799) is cursed H0779 (8714).
022:007 And the elders H2205 of Moab H4124 and the elders H2205 of Midian H4080 departed H3212 (8799) with the rewards of divination H7081 in their hand H3027; and they came H0935 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, and spake H1696 (8762) unto him the words H1697 of Balak H1111.
022:008 And he said H0559 (8799) unto them, Lodge H3885 (8798) here this night H3915, and I will bring H7725 you word H1697 again H7725 (8689), as the LORD H3068 shall speak H1696 (8762) unto me: and the princes H8269 of Moab H4124 abode H3427 (8799) with Balaam H1109.
022:009 And God H0430 came H0935 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, and said H0559 (8799), What men H0582 [are] these with thee?
022:010 And Balaam H1109 said H0559 (8799) unto God H0430, Balak H1111 the son H1121 of Zippor H6834, king H4428 of Moab H4124, hath sent H7971 (8804) unto me, [saying],
022:011 Behold, [there is] a people H5971 come out H3318 (8802) of Egypt H4714, which covereth H3680 (8762) the face H5869 of the earth H0776: come H3212 (8798) now, curse H6895 (8798) me them; peradventure I shall be able H3201 (8799) to overcome H3898 (8736) them, and drive them out H1644 (8765).
022:012 And God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, Thou shalt not go H3212 (8799) with them; thou shalt not curse H0779 (8799) the people H5971: for they [are] blessed H1288 (8803).
022:013 And Balaam H1109 rose up H6965 (8799) in the morning H1242, and said H0559 (8799) unto the princes H8269 of Balak H1111, Get H3212 (8798) you into your land H0776: for the LORD H3068 refuseth H3985 (8765) to give me leave H5414 (8800) to go H1980 (8800) with you.
022:014 And the princes H8269 of Moab H4124 rose up H6965 (8799), and they went H0935 (8799) unto Balak H1111, and said H0559 (8799), Balaam H1109 refuseth H3985 (8765) to come H1980 (8800) with us.
022:015 And Balak H1111 sent H7971 (8800) yet again H3254 (8686) princes H8269, more H7227, and more honourable H3513 (8737) than they.
022:016 And they came H0935 (8799) to Balaam H1109, and said H0559 (8799) to him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) Balak H1111 the son H1121 of Zippor H6834, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder H4513 (8735) thee from coming H1980 (8800) unto me:
022:017 For I will promote H3513 thee unto very H3966 great H3513 (8763) honour H3513 (8762), and I will do H6213 (8799) whatsoever thou sayest H0559 (8799) unto me: come H3212 (8798) therefore, I pray thee, curse H6895 (8798) me this people H5971.
022:018 And Balaam H1109 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) unto the servants H5650 of Balak H1111, If Balak H1111 would give H5414 (8799) me his house H1004 full H4393 of silver H3701 and gold H2091, I cannot H3201 (8799) go beyond H5674 (8800) the word H6310 of the LORD H3068 my God H0430, to do H6213 (8800) less H6996 or more H1419.
022:019 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry H3427 (8798) ye also here this night H3915, that I may know H3045 (8799) what the LORD H3068 will say H1696 (8763) unto me more H3254 (8686).
022:020 And God H0430 came H0935 (8799) unto Balaam H1109 at night H3915, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, If the men H0582 come H0935 (8804) to call H7121 (8800) thee, rise up H6965 (8798), [and] go H3212 (8798) with them; but yet H0389 the word H1697 which I shall say H1696 (8762) unto thee, that shalt thou do H6213 (8799).
022:021 And Balaam H1109 rose up H6965 (8799) in the morning H1242, and saddled H2280 (8799) his ass H0860, and went H3212 (8799) with the princes H8269 of Moab H4124.
022:022 And God’s H0430 anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799) because he went H1980 (8802): and the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 stood H3320 (8691) in the way H1870 for an adversary H7854 against him. Now he was riding H7392 (8802) upon his ass H0860, and his two H8147 servants H5288 [were] with him.
022:023 And the ass H0860 saw H7200 (8799) the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 standing H5324 (8737) in the way H1870, and his sword H2719 drawn H8025 (8803) in his hand H3027: and the ass H0860 turned aside H5186 (8799) out of the way H1870, and went H3212 (8799) into the field H7704: and Balaam H1109 smote H5221 (8686) the ass H0860, to turn H5186 (8687) her into the way H1870.
022:024 But the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 stood H5975 (8799) in a path H4934 of the vineyards H3754, a wall H1447 [being] on this side, and a wall H1447 on that side.
022:025 And when the ass H0860 saw H7200 (8799) the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068, she thrust H3905 (8735) herself unto the wall H7023, and crushed H3905 (8799) Balaam’s H1109 foot H7272 against the wall H7023: and he smote H5221 (8687) her again H3254 (8686).
022:026 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 went H5674 (8800) further H3254 (8686), and stood H5975 (8799) in a narrow H6862 place H4725, where [was] no way H1870 to turn H5186 (8800) either to the right hand H3225 or to the left H8040.
022:027 And when the ass H0860 saw H7200 (8799) the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068, she fell down H7257 (8799) under Balaam H1109: and Balaam’s H1109 anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799), and he smote H5221 (8686) the ass H0860 with a staff H4731.
022:028 And the LORD H3068 opened H6605 (8799) the mouth H6310 of the ass H0860, and she said H0559 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, What have I done H6213 (8804) unto thee, that thou hast smitten H5221 (8689) me these three H7969 times H7272?
022:029 And Balaam H1109 said H0559 (8799) unto the ass H0860, Because thou hast mocked H5953 (8694) me: I would H3863 there were H3426 a sword H2719 in mine hand H3027, for now would I kill H2026 (8804) thee.
022:030 And the ass H0860 said H0559 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, [Am] not I thine ass H0860, upon which thou hast ridden H7392 (8804) ever since [I was] thine unto this day H3117? was I ever H5532 (8687) wont H5532 (8689) to do so H6213 (8800) unto thee? And he said H0559 (8799), Nay.
022:031 Then the LORD H3068 opened H1540 (8762) the eyes H5869 of Balaam H1109, and he saw H7200 (8799) the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 standing H5324 (8737) in the way H1870, and his sword H2719 drawn H8025 (8803) in his hand H3027: and he bowed down H6915 (8799) his head, and fell flat H7812 (8691) on his face H0639.
022:032 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten H5221 (8689) thine ass H0860 these three H7969 times H7272? behold, I went out H3318 (8804) to withstand H7854 thee, because [thy] way H1870 is perverse H3399 (8804) before me:
022:033 And the ass H0860 saw H7200 (8799) me, and turned H5186 (8799) from me H6440 these three H7969 times H7272: unless H0194 she had turned H5186 (8804) from me H6440, surely now also I had slain H2026 (8804) thee, and saved her alive H2421 (8689).
022:034 And Balaam H1109 said H0559 (8799) unto the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068, I have sinned H2398 (8804); for I knew H3045 (8804) not that thou stoodest H5324 (8737) in the way H1870 against H7125 (8800) me: now therefore, if it displease thee H7489 (8804) H5869, I will get me back again H7725 (8799).
022:035 And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, Go H3212 (8798) with the men H0582: but only H0657 the word H1697 that I shall speak H1696 (8762) unto thee, that thou shalt speak H1696 (8762). So Balaam H1109 went H3212 (8799) with the princes H8269 of Balak H1111.
022:036 And when Balak H1111 heard H8085 (8799) that Balaam H1109 was come H0935 (8802), he went out H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) him unto a city H5892 of Moab H4124, which [is] in the border H1366 of Arnon H0769, which [is] in the utmost H7097 coast H1366.
022:037 And Balak H1111 said H0559 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, Did I not earnestly H7971 (8800) send H7971 (8804) unto thee to call H7121 (8800) thee? wherefore camest H1980 (8804) thou not unto me? am I not able H3201 (8799) indeed H0552 to promote thee to honour H3513 (8763)?
022:038 And Balaam H1109 said H0559 (8799) unto Balak H1111, Lo, I am come H0935 (8804) unto thee: have I now any power H3201 (8799) at all H3201 (8800) to say H1696 (8763) any thing H3972? the word H1697 that God H0430 putteth H7760 (8799) in my mouth H6310, that shall I speak H1696 (8762).
022:039 And Balaam H1109 went H3212 (8799) with Balak H1111, and they came H0935 (8799) unto Kirjathhuzoth H2351 H7155.
022:040 And Balak H1111 offered H2076 (8799) oxen H1241 and sheep H6629, and sent H7971 (8762) to Balaam H1109, and to the princes H8269 that [were] with him.
022:041 And it came to pass on the morrow H1242, that Balak H1111 took H3947 (8799) Balaam H1109, and brought him up H5927 (8686) into the high places H1116 of Baal H1120, that thence he might see H7200 (8799) the utmost H7097 [part] of the people H5971.
023:001 ¶  And Balaam H1109 said H0559 (8799) unto Balak H1111, Build H1129 (8798) me here seven H7651 altars H4196, and prepare H3559 (8685) me here seven H7651 oxen H6499 and seven H7651 rams H0352.
023:002 And Balak H1111 did H6213 (8799) as Balaam H1109 had spoken H1696 (8765); and Balak H1111 and Balaam H1109 offered H5927 (8686) on [every] altar H4196 a bullock H6499 and a ram H0352.
023:003 And Balaam H1109 said H0559 (8799) unto Balak H1111, Stand H3320 (8690) by thy burnt offering H5930, and I will go H3212 (8799): peradventure the LORD H3068 will come H7136 (8735) to meet H7125 (8800) me: and whatsoever H1697 he sheweth H7200 (8686) me I will tell H5046 (8689) thee. And he went H3212 (8799) to an high place H8205.
023:004 And God H0430 met H7136 (8735) Balaam H1109: and he said H0559 (8799) unto him, I have prepared H6186 (8804) seven H7651 altars H4196, and I have offered H5927 (8686) upon [every] altar H4196 a bullock H6499 and a ram H0352.
023:005 And the LORD H3068 put H7760 (8799) a word H1697 in Balaam’s H1109 mouth H6310, and said H0559 (8799), Return H7725 (8798) unto Balak H1111, and thus thou shalt speak H1696 (8762).
023:006 And he returned H7725 (8799) unto him, and, lo, he stood H5324 (8737) by his burnt sacrifice H5930, he, and all the princes H8269 of Moab H4124.
023:007 And he took up H5375 (8799) his parable H4912, and said H0559 (8799), Balak H1111 the king H4428 of Moab H4124 hath brought H5148 (8686) me from Aram H0758, out of the mountains H2042 of the east H6924, [saying], Come H3212 (8798), curse H0779 (8798) me Jacob H3290, and come H3212 (8798), defy H2194 (8798) Israel H3478.
023:008 How H4100 shall I curse H5344 (8799), whom God H0410 hath not cursed H6895 (8804)? or how shall I defy H2194 (8799), [whom] the LORD H3068 hath not defied H2194 (8804)?
023:009 For from the top H7218 of the rocks H6697 I see H7200 (8799) him, and from the hills H1389 I behold H7789 (8799) him: lo, the people H5971 shall dwell H7931 (8799) alone H0910, and shall not be reckoned H2803 (8691) among the nations H1471.
023:010 Who can count H4487 (8804) the dust H6083 of Jacob H3290, and the number H4557 of the fourth H7255 [part] of Israel H3478? Let me die H4191 (8799) H5315 the death H4194 of the righteous H3477, and let my last H0319 end be like his!
023:011 And Balak H1111 said H0559 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, What hast thou done H6213 (8804) unto me? I took H3947 (8804) thee to curse H6895 (8800) mine enemies H0341 (8802), and, behold, thou hast blessed H1288 (8765) [them] altogether H1288 (8763).
023:012 And he answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Must I not take heed H8104 (8799) to speak H1696 (8763) that which the LORD H3068 hath put H7760 (8799) in my mouth H6310?
023:013 And Balak H1111 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Come H3212 (8798), I pray thee, with me unto another H0312 place H4725, from whence thou mayest see H7200 (8799) them: thou shalt see H7200 (8799) but H0657 the utmost H7097 part of them, and shalt not see H7200 (8799) them all: and curse H6895 (8798) me them from thence.
023:014 And he brought H3947 (8799) him into the field H7704 of Zophim H6839 (8677) H6822 (8802), to the top H7218 of Pisgah H6449, and built H1129 (8799) seven H7651 altars H4196, and offered H5927 (8686) a bullock H6499 and a ram H0352 on [every] altar H4196.
023:015 And he said H0559 (8799) unto Balak H1111, Stand H3320 (8690) here H3541 by thy burnt offering H5930, while I meet H7136 (8735) [the LORD] yonder H3541.
023:016 And the LORD H3068 met H7136 (8735) Balaam H1109, and put H7760 (8799) a word H1697 in his mouth H6310, and said H0559 (8799), Go again H7725 (8798) unto Balak H1111, and say H1696 (8762) thus.
023:017 And when he came H0935 (8799) to him, behold, he stood H5324 (8737) by his burnt offering H5930, and the princes H8269 of Moab H4124 with him. And Balak H1111 said H0559 (8799) unto him, What hath the LORD H3068 spoken H1696 (8765)?
023:018 And he took up H5375 (8799) his parable H4912, and said H0559 (8799), Rise up H6965 (8798), Balak H1111, and hear H8085 (8798); hearken H0238 (8685) unto me, thou son H1121 of Zippor H6834:
023:019 God H0410 [is] not a man H0376, that he should lie H3576 (8762); neither the son H1121 of man H0120, that he should repent H5162 (8691): hath he said H0559 (8804), and shall he not do H6213 (8799) [it]? or hath he spoken H1696 (8765), and shall he not make it good H6965 (8686)?
023:020 Behold, I have received H3947 (8804) [commandment] to bless H1288 (8763): and he hath blessed H1288 (8765); and I cannot reverse H7725 (8686) it.
023:021 He hath not beheld H5027 (8689) iniquity H0205 in Jacob H3290, neither hath he seen H7200 (8804) perverseness H5999 in Israel H3478: the LORD H3068 his God H0430 [is] with him, and the shout H8643 of a king H4428 [is] among them.
023:022 God H0410 brought them out H3318 (8688) of Egypt H4714; he hath as it were the strength H8443 of an unicorn H7214.
023:023 Surely [there is] no enchantment H5173 against Jacob H3290, neither [is there] any divination H7081 against Israel H3478: according to this time H6256 it shall be said H0559 (8735) of Jacob H3290 and of Israel H3478, What hath God H0410 wrought H6466 (8804)!
023:024 Behold, the people H5971 shall rise up H6965 (8799) as a great lion H3833, and lift up H5375 (8691) himself as a young lion H0738: he shall not lie down H7901 (8799) until he eat H0398 (8799) [of] the prey H2964, and drink H8354 (8799) the blood H1818 of the slain H2491.
023:025 And Balak H1111 said H0559 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, Neither curse H5344 (8799) them at all H6895 (8800), nor bless H1288 (8762) them at all H1288 (8763).
023:026 But Balaam H1109 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) unto Balak H1111, Told H1696 (8765) not I thee, saying H0559 (8800), All that the LORD H3068 speaketh H1696 (8762), that I must do H6213 (8799)?
023:027 And Balak H1111 said H0559 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, Come H3212 (8798), I pray thee, I will bring H3947 (8799) thee unto another H0312 place H4725; peradventure it will please H3474 (8799) H5869 God H0430 that thou mayest curse H6895 (8804) me them from thence.
023:028 And Balak H1111 brought H3947 (8799) Balaam H1109 unto the top H7218 of Peor H6465, that looketh H8259 (8737) toward H6440 Jeshimon H3452.
023:029 And Balaam H1109 said H0559 (8799) unto Balak H1111, Build H1129 (8798) me here seven H7651 altars H4196, and prepare H3559 (8685) me here seven H7651 bullocks H6499 and seven H7651 rams H0352.
023:030 And Balak H1111 did H6213 (8799) as Balaam H1109 had said H0559 (8804), and offered H5927 (8686) a bullock H6499 and a ram H0352 on [every] altar H4196.
024:001 ¶  And when Balaam H1109 saw H7200 (8799) that it pleased H5869 H2895 (8804) the LORD H3068 to bless H1288 (8763) Israel H3478, he went H1980 (8804) not, as at other times H6471, to seek H7125 (8800) for enchantments H5173, but he set H7896 (8799) his face H6440 toward the wilderness H4057.
024:002 And Balaam H1109 lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and he saw H7200 (8799) Israel H3478 abiding H7931 (8802) [in his tents] according to their tribes H7626; and the spirit H7307 of God H0430 came upon him.
024:003 And he took up H5375 (8799) his parable H4912, and said H0559 (8799), Balaam H1109 the son H1121 of Beor H1160 hath said H5002 (8803), and the man H1397 whose eyes H5869 are open H8365 (8803) hath said H5002 (8803):
024:004 He hath said H5002 (8803), which heard H8085 (8802) the words H0561 of God H0410, which saw H2372 (8799) the vision H4236 of the Almighty H7706, falling H5307 (8802) [into a trance], but having his eyes H5869 open H1540 (8803):
024:005 How goodly H2895 (8804) are thy tents H0168, O Jacob H3290, [and] thy tabernacles H4908, O Israel H3478!
024:006 As the valleys H5158 are they spread forth H5186 (8738), as gardens H1593 by the river’s side H5104, as the trees of lign aloes H0174 which the LORD H3068 hath planted H5193 (8804), [and] as cedar trees H0730 beside the waters H4325.
024:007 He shall pour H5140 the water H4325 out H5140 (8799) of his buckets H1805, and his seed H2233 [shall be] in many H7227 waters H4325, and his king H4428 shall be higher H7311 (8799) than Agag H0090, and his kingdom H4438 shall be exalted H5375 (8691).
024:008 God H0410 brought him forth H3318 (8688) out of Egypt H4714; he hath as it were the strength H8443 of an unicorn H7214: he shall eat up H0398 (8799) the nations H1471 his enemies H6862, and shall break H1633 (8762) their bones H6106, and pierce H4272 (8799) [them] through with his arrows H2671.
024:009 He couched H3766 (8804), he lay down H7901 (8804) as a lion H0738, and as a great lion H3833: who shall stir him up H6965 (8686)? Blessed H1288 (8803) [is] he that blesseth H1288 (8764) thee, and cursed H0779 (8803) [is] he that curseth H0779 (8802) thee.
024:010 And Balak’s H1111 anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799) against Balaam H1109, and he smote H5606 his hands H3709 together H5606 (8799): and Balak H1111 said H0559 (8799) unto Balaam H1109, I called H7121 (8804) thee to curse H6895 (8800) mine enemies H0341 (8802), and, behold, thou hast altogether H1288 (8763) blessed H1288 (8765) [them] these three H7969 times H6471.
024:011 Therefore now flee H1272 (8798) thou to thy place H4725: I thought H0559 (8804) to promote H3513 thee unto great H3513 (8763) honour H3513 (8762); but, lo, the LORD H3068 hath kept thee back H4513 (8804) from honour H3519.
024:012 And Balaam H1109 said H0559 (8799) unto Balak H1111, Spake H1696 (8765) I not also to thy messengers H4397 which thou sentest H7971 (8804) unto me, saying H0559 (8800),
024:013 If Balak H1111 would give H5414 (8799) me his house H1004 full H4393 of silver H3701 and gold H2091, I cannot H3201 (8799) go beyond H5674 (8800) the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068, to do H6213 (8800) [either] good H2896 or bad H7451 of mine own mind H3820; [but] what the LORD H3068 saith H1696 (8762), that will I speak H1696 (8762)?
024:014 And now, behold, I go H1980 (8802) unto my people H5971: come H3212 (8798) [therefore, and] I will advertise H3289 (8799) thee what this people H5971 shall do H6213 (8799) to thy people H5971 in the latter H0319 days H3117.
024:015 And he took up H5375 (8799) his parable H4912, and said H0559 (8799), Balaam H1109 the son H1121 of Beor H1160 hath said H5002 (8803), and the man H1397 whose eyes H5869 are open H8365 (8803) hath said H5002 (8803):
024:016 He hath said H5002 (8803), which heard H8085 (8802) the words H0561 of God H0410, and knew H3045 (8802) the knowledge H1847 of the most High H5945, [which] saw H2372 (8799) the vision H4236 of the Almighty H7706, falling H5307 (8802) [into a trance], but having his eyes H5869 open H1540 (8803):
024:017 I shall see H7200 (8799) him, but not now: I shall behold H7789 (8799) him, but not nigh H7138: there shall come H1869 (8804) a Star H3556 out of Jacob H3290, and a Sceptre H7626 shall rise H6965 (8804) out of Israel H3478, and shall smite H4272 (8804) the corners H6285 of Moab H4124, and destroy H6979 (8773) all the children H1121 of Sheth H8352 (8676) H8351.
024:018 And Edom H0123 shall be a possession H3424, Seir H8165 also shall be a possession H3424 for his enemies H0341 (8802); and Israel H3478 shall do H6213 (8802) valiantly H2428.
024:019 Out of Jacob H3290 shall come he that shall have dominion H7287 (8799), and shall destroy H0006 (8689) him that remaineth H8300 of the city H5892.
024:020 And when he looked H7200 (8799) on Amalek H6002, he took up H5375 (8799) his parable H4912, and said H0559 (8799), Amalek H6002 [was] the first H7225 of the nations H1471; but his latter H0319 end [shall be] that he perish H0008 for ever H5703.
024:021 And he looked H7200 (8799) on the Kenites H7017, and took up H5375 (8799) his parable H4912, and said H0559 (8799), Strong H0386 is thy dwellingplace H4186, and thou puttest H7760 (8798) thy nest H7064 in a rock H5553.
024:022 Nevertheless the Kenite H7014 shall H0518 be wasted H1197 (8763), until Asshur H0804 shall carry thee away captive H7617 (8799).
024:023 And he took up H5375 (8799) his parable H4912, and said H0559 (8799), Alas H0188, who shall live H2421 (8799) when God H0410 doeth H7760 (8800) this!
024:024 And ships H6716 [shall come] from the coast H3027 of Chittim H3794, and shall afflict H6031 (8765) Asshur H0804, and shall afflict H6031 (8765) Eber H5677, and he also shall perish H0008 for ever H5703.
024:025 And Balaam H1109 rose up H6965 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) and returned H7725 (8799) to his place H4725: and Balak H1111 also went H1980 (8804) his way H1870.
025:001 ¶  And Israel H3478 abode H3427 (8799) in Shittim H7851, and the people H5971 began H2490 (8686) to commit whoredom H2181 (8800) with the daughters H1323 of Moab H4124.
025:002 And they called H7121 (8799) the people H5971 unto the sacrifices H2077 of their gods H0430: and the people H5971 did eat H0398 (8799), and bowed down H7812 (8691) to their gods H0430.
025:003 And Israel H3478 joined H6775 (8735) himself unto Baalpeor H1187: and the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8799) against Israel H3478.
025:004 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Take H3947 (8798) all the heads H7218 of the people H5971, and hang them up H3363 (8685) before H5048 the LORD H3068 against the sun H8121, that the fierce H2740 anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 may be turned away H7725 (8799) from Israel H3478.
025:005 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto the judges H8199 (8802) of Israel H3478, Slay H2026 (8798) ye every H0376 one H0376 his men H0582 that were joined H6775 (8737) unto Baalpeor H1187.
025:006 And, behold, one H0376 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 came H0935 (8802) and brought H7126 (8686) unto his brethren H0251 a Midianitish woman H4084 in the sight H5869 of Moses H4872, and in the sight H5869 of all the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, who [were] weeping H1058 (8802) [before] the door H6607 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150.
025:007 And when Phinehas H6372, the son H1121 of Eleazar H0499, the son H1121 of Aaron H0175 the priest H3548, saw H7200 (8799) [it], he rose up H6965 (8799) from among H8432 the congregation H5712, and took H3947 (8799) a javelin H7420 in his hand H3027;
025:008 And he went H0935 (8799) after H0310 the man H0376 of Israel H3478 into the tent H6898, and thrust H1856 (8799) both H8147 of them through, the man H0376 of Israel H3478, and the woman H0802 through H0413 her belly H6897. So the plague H4046 was stayed H6113 (8735) from the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
025:009 And those that died H4191 (8801) in the plague H4046 were twenty H6242 and four H0702 thousand H0505.
025:010 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
025:011 Phinehas H6372, the son H1121 of Eleazar H0499, the son H1121 of Aaron H0175 the priest H3548, hath turned H7725 my wrath H2534 away H7725 (8689) from the children H1121 of Israel H3478, while he was zealous H7065 (8763) for my sake H7068 among H8432 them, that I consumed H3615 (8765) not the children H1121 of Israel H3478 in my jealousy H7068.
025:012 Wherefore say H0559 (8798), Behold, I give H5414 (8802) unto him my covenant H1285 of peace H7965:
025:013 And he shall have it, and his seed H2233 after H0310 him, [even] the covenant H1285 of an everlasting H5769 priesthood H3550; because H0834 he was zealous H7065 (8765) for his God H0430, and made an atonement H3722 (8762) for the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
025:014 Now the name H8034 of the Israelite H0376 that was slain H5221 (8716), [even] that was slain H5221 (8717) with the Midianitish woman H4084, [was] Zimri H2174, the son H1121 of Salu H5543, a prince H5387 of a chief H0001 house H1004 among the Simeonites H8099.

026:063 These [are] they that were numbered H6485 (8803) by Moses H4872 and Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, who numbered H6485 (8804) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 in the plains H6160 of Moab H4124 by Jordan H3383 [near] Jericho H3405.

026:065 For the LORD H3068 had said H0559 (8804) of them, They shall surely H4191 (8800) die H4191 (8799) in the wilderness H4057. And there was not left H3498 (8738) a man H0376 of them, save Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312, and Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126.

027:003 Our father H0001 died H4191 (8804) in the wilderness H4057, and he was not in H8432 the company H5712 of them that gathered themselves together H3259 (8737) against the LORD H3068 in the company H5712 of Korah H7141; but died H4191 (8804) in his own sin H2399, and had no sons H1121.
027:004 Why should the name H8034 of our father H0001 be done away H1639 (8735) from among H8432 his family H4940, because he hath no son H1121? Give H5414 (8798) unto us [therefore] a possession H0272 among H8432 the brethren H0251 of our father H0001.
027:005 And Moses H4872 brought H7126 (8686) their cause H4941 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
027:006 And the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
027:007 The daughters H1323 of Zelophehad H6765 speak H1696 (8802) right H3651: thou shalt surely H5414 (8800) give H5414 (8799) them a possession H0272 of an inheritance H5159 among H8432 their father’s H0001 brethren H0251; and thou shalt cause the inheritance H5159 of their father H0001 to pass H5674 (8689) unto them.
027:008 And thou shalt speak H1696 (8762) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), If a man H0376 die H4191 (8799), and have no son H1121, then ye shall cause his inheritance H5159 to pass H5674 (8689) unto his daughter H1323.
027:009 And if he have no daughter H1323, then ye shall give H5414 (8804) his inheritance H5159 unto his brethren H0251.
027:010 And if he have no brethren H0251, then ye shall give H5414 (8804) his inheritance H5159 unto his father’s H0001 brethren H0251.
027:011 And if his father H0001 have no brethren H0251, then ye shall give H5414 (8804) his inheritance H5159 unto his kinsman H7607 that is next H7138 to him of his family H4940, and he shall possess H3423 (8804) it: and it shall be unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478 a statute H2708 of judgment H4941, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
027:012 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Get thee up H5927 (8798) into this mount H2022 Abarim H5682, and see H7200 (8798) the land H0776 which I have given H5414 (8804) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
027:013 And when thou hast seen H7200 (8804) it, thou also shalt be gathered H0622 (8738) unto thy people H5971, as Aaron H0175 thy brother H0251 was gathered H0622 (8738).
027:014 For ye rebelled H4784 (8804) against my commandment H6310 in the desert H4057 of Zin H6790, in the strife H4808 of the congregation H5712, to sanctify H6942 (8687) me at the water H4325 before their eyes H5869: that [is] the water H4325 of Meribah H4809 in Kadesh H6946 in the wilderness H4057 of Zin H6790.
027:015 And Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8762) unto the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
027:016 Let the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of the spirits H7307 of all flesh H1320, set H6485 (8799) a man H0376 over the congregation H5712,
027:017 Which may go out H3318 (8799) before H6440 them, and which may go in H0935 (8799) before H6440 them, and which may lead them out H3318 (8686), and which may bring them in H0935 (8686); that the congregation H5712 of the LORD H3068 be not as sheep H6629 which have no shepherd H7462 (8802).
027:018 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Take H3947 (8798) thee Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, a man H0376 in whom [is] the spirit H7307, and lay H5564 (8804) thine hand H3027 upon him;
027:019 And set H5975 (8689) him before H6440 Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and before H6440 all the congregation H5712; and give him a charge H6680 (8765) in their sight H5869.
027:020 And thou shalt put H5414 (8804) [some] of thine honour H1935 upon him, that all the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 may be obedient H8085 (8799).
027:021 And he shall stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, who shall ask H7592 (8804) [counsel] for him after the judgment H4941 of Urim H0224 before H6440 the LORD H3068: at his word H6310 shall they go out H3318 (8799), and at his word H6310 they shall come in H0935 (8799), [both] he, and all the children H1121 of Israel H3478 with him, even all the congregation H5712.
027:022 And Moses H4872 did H6213 (8799) as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) him: and he took H3947 (8799) Joshua H3091, and set H5975 (8686) him before H6440 Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and before H6440 all the congregation H5712:
027:023 And he laid H5564 (8799) his hands H3027 upon him, and gave him a charge H6680 (8762), as the LORD H3068 commanded H1696 (8765) by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872.
028:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
028:002 Command H6680 (8761) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, My offering H7133, [and] my bread H3899 for my sacrifices made by fire H0801, [for] a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto me, shall ye observe H8104 (8799) to offer H7126 (8687) unto me in their due season H4150.
028:003 And thou shalt say H0559 (8804) unto them, This [is] the offering made by fire H0801 which ye shall offer H7126 (8686) unto the LORD H3068; two H8147 lambs H3532 of the first H1121 year H8141 without spot H8549 day by day H3117, [for] a continual H8548 burnt offering H5930.
028:004 The one H0259 lamb H3532 shalt thou offer H6213 (8799) in the morning H1242, and the other H8145 lamb H3532 shalt thou offer H6213 (8799) at even H6153;

028:007 And the drink offering H5262 thereof [shall be] the fourth H7243 [part] of an hin H1969 for the one H0259 lamb H3532: in the holy H6944 [place] shalt thou cause the strong wine H7941 to be poured H5258 (8685) unto the LORD H3068 [for] a drink offering H5262.
028:008 And the other H8145 lamb H3532 shalt thou offer H6213 (8799) at even H6153: as the meat offering H4503 of the morning H1242, and as the drink offering H5262 thereof, thou shalt offer H6213 (8799) [it], a sacrifice made by fire H0801, of a sweet H5207 savour H7381 unto the LORD H3068.

030:004 And her father H0001 hear H8085 (8804) her vow H5088, and her bond H0632 wherewith she hath bound H0631 (8804) her soul H5315, and her father H0001 shall hold his peace H2790 (8689) at her: then all her vows H5088 shall stand H6965 (8804), and every bond H0632 wherewith she hath bound H0631 (8804) her soul H5315 shall stand H6965 (8799).
030:005 But if her father H0001 disallow H5106 (8689) her in the day H3117 that he heareth H8085 (8800); not any of her vows H5088, or of her bonds H0632 wherewith she hath bound H0631 (8804) her soul H5315, shall stand H6965 (8799): and the LORD H3068 shall forgive H5545 (8799) her, because her father H0001 disallowed H5106 (8689) her.
030:006 And if she had at all an husband H0376, when she vowed H5088, or uttered H4008 ought out of her lips H8193, wherewith she bound H0631 (8804) her soul H5315;
030:007 And her husband H0376 heard H8085 (8804) [it,] and held his peace H2790 (8689) at her in the day H3117 that he heard H8085 (8800) [it]: then her vows H5088 shall stand H6965 (8804), and her bonds H0632 wherewith she bound H0631 (8804) her soul H5315 shall stand H6965 (8799).
030:008 But if her husband H0376 disallowed H5106 (8686) her on the day H3117 that he heard H8085 (8800) [it]; then he shall make her vow which she vowed H5088, and that which she uttered H4008 with her lips H8193, wherewith she bound H0631 (8804) her soul H5315, of none effect H6565 (8689): and the LORD H3068 shall forgive H5545 (8799) her.
030:009 But every vow H5088 of a widow H0490, and of her that is divorced H1644 (8803), wherewith they have bound H0631 (8804) their souls H5315, shall stand H6965 (8799) against her.
030:010 And if she vowed H5087 (8804) in her husband’s H0376 house H1004, or bound H0631 (8804) her soul H5315 by a bond H0632 with an oath H7621;
030:011 And her husband H0376 heard H8085 (8804) [it], and held his peace H2790 (8689) at her, [and] disallowed H5106 (8689) her not: then all her vows H5088 shall stand H6965 (8799), and every bond H0632 wherewith she bound H0631 (8804) her soul H5315 shall stand H6965 (8804).
030:012 But if her husband H0376 hath utterly H6565 (8687) made them void H6565 (8686) on the day H3117 he heard H8085 (8800) [them; then] whatsoever proceeded H4161 out of her lips H8193 concerning her vows H5088, or concerning the bond H0632 of her soul H5315, shall not stand H6965 (8799): her husband H0376 hath made them void H6565 (8689); and the LORD H3068 shall forgive H5545 (8799) her.
030:013 Every vow H5088, and every binding H0632 oath H7621 to afflict H6031 (8763) the soul H5315, her husband H0376 may establish H6965 (8686) it, or her husband H0376 may make it void H6565 (8686).
030:014 But if her husband H0376 altogether H2790 (8687) hold his peace H2790 (8686) at her from day H3117 to day H3117; then he establisheth H6965 (8689) all her vows H5088, or all her bonds H0632, which [are] upon her: he confirmeth H6965 (8689) them, because he held his peace H2790 (8689) at her in the day H3117 that he heard H8085 (8800) [them].
030:015 But if he shall any ways H6565 (8687) make them void H6565 (8686) after H0310 that he hath heard H8085 (8800) [them]; then he shall bear H5375 (8804) her iniquity H5771.
030:016 These [are] the statutes H2706, which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872, between a man H0376 and his wife H0802, between the father H0001 and his daughter H1323, [being yet] in her youth H5271 in her father’s H0001 house H1004.
031:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
031:002 Avenge H5358 (8798) H5360 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 of the Midianites H4084: afterward H0310 shalt thou be gathered H0622 (8735) unto thy people H5971.
031:003 And Moses H4872 spake H1696 (8762) unto the people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Arm H2502 (8734) some H0582 of yourselves unto the war H6635, and let them go against the Midianites H4080, and avenge H5414 (8800) H5360 the LORD H3068 of Midian H4080.
031:004 Of every tribe H4294 H4294 a thousand H0505 H0505, throughout all the tribes H4294 of Israel H3478, shall ye send H7971 (8799) to the war H6635.
031:005 So there were delivered H4560 (8735) out of the thousands H0505 of Israel H3478, a thousand H0505 of [every] tribe H4294, twelve H8147 H6240 thousand H0505 armed H2502 (8803) for war H6635.
031:006 And Moses H4872 sent H7971 (8799) them to the war H6635, a thousand H0505 of [every] tribe H4294, them and Phinehas H6372 the son H1121 of Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, to the war H6635, with the holy H6944 instruments H3627, and the trumpets H2689 to blow H8643 in his hand H3027.
031:007 And they warred H6633 (8799) against the Midianites H4080, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872; and they slew H2026 (8799) all the males H2145.
031:008 And they slew H2026 (8804) the kings H4428 of Midian H4080, beside H5921 the rest of them that were slain H2491; [namely], Evi H0189, and Rekem H7552, and Zur H6698, and Hur H2354, and Reba H7254, five H2568 kings H4428 of Midian H4080: Balaam H1109 also the son H1121 of Beor H1160 they slew H2026 (8804) with the sword H2719.
031:009 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 took [all] the women H0802 of Midian H4080 captives H7617 (8799), and their little ones H2945, and took the spoil H0962 (8804) of all their cattle H0929, and all their flocks H4735, and all their goods H2428.
031:010 And they burnt H8313 (8804) all their cities H5892 wherein they dwelt H4186, and all their goodly castles H2918, with fire H0784.
031:011 And they took H3947 (8799) all the spoil H7998, and all the prey H4455, [both] of men H0120 and of beasts H0929.
031:012 And they brought H0935 (8686) the captives H7628, and the prey H4455, and the spoil H7998, unto Moses H4872, and Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and unto the congregation H5712 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, unto the camp H4264 at the plains H6160 of Moab H4124, which [are] by Jordan H3383 [near] Jericho H3405.
031:013 And Moses H4872, and Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and all the princes H5387 of the congregation H5712, went forth H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) them without H2351 the camp H4264.
031:014 And Moses H4872 was wroth H7107 (8799) with the officers H6485 (8803) of the host H2428, [with] the captains H8269 over thousands H0505, and captains H8269 over hundreds H3967, which came H0935 (8802) from H6635 the battle H4421.
031:015 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Have ye saved H2421 (8765) all the women H5347 alive H2421 (8765)?
031:016 Behold, these H2007 caused H1961 (8804) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, through the counsel H1697 of Balaam H1109, to commit H4560 (8800) trespass H4604 against the LORD H3068 in the matter H1697 of Peor H6465, and there was a plague H4046 among the congregation H5712 of the LORD H3068.
031:017 Now therefore kill H2026 (8798) every male H2145 among the little ones H2945, and kill H2026 (8798) every woman H0802 that hath known H3045 (8802) man H0376 by lying H4904 with him H2145.
031:018 But all the women H0802 children H2945, that have not known H3045 (8804) a man H2145 by lying H4904 with him, keep alive H2421 (8685) for yourselves.
031:019 And do ye abide H2583 (8798) without H2351 the camp H4264 seven H7651 days H3117: whosoever hath killed H2026 (8802) any person H5315, and whosoever hath touched H5060 (8802) any slain H2491, purify H2398 (8691) [both] yourselves and your captives H7628 on the third H7992 day H3117, and on the seventh H7637 day H3117.
031:020 And purify H2398 (8691) all [your] raiment H0899, and all that is made H3627 of skins H5785, and all work H4639 of goats H5795 ’ [hair], and all things made H3627 of wood H6086.
031:021 And Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548 said H0559 (8799) unto the men H0582 of war H6635 which went H0935 (8802) to the battle H4421, This [is] the ordinance H2708 of the law H8451 which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872;
031:022 Only the gold H2091, and the silver H3701, the brass H5178, the iron H1270, the tin H0913, and the lead H5777,
031:023 Every thing H1697 that may abide H0935 (8799) the fire H0784, ye shall make [it] go through H5674 (8686) the fire H0784, and it shall be clean H2891 (8804): nevertheless it shall be purified H2398 (8691) with the water H4325 of separation H5079: and all that abideth H0935 (8799) not the fire H0784 ye shall make go through H5674 (8686) the water H4325.
031:024 And ye shall wash H3526 (8765) your clothes H0899 on the seventh H7637 day H3117, and ye shall be clean H2891 (8804), and afterward H0310 ye shall come H0935 (8799) into the camp H4264.
031:025 And the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
031:026 Take H5375 (8798) the sum H7218 of the prey H4455 that was taken H7628, [both] of man H0120 and of beast H0929, thou, and Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and the chief H7218 fathers H0001 of the congregation H5712:
031:027 And divide H2673 the prey H4455 into two parts H2673 (8804); between them that took H8610 (8802) the war H4421 upon them, who went out H3318 (8802) to battle H6635, and between all the congregation H5712:
031:028 And levy H7311 (8689) a tribute H4371 unto the LORD H3068 of the men H0582 of war H4421 which went out H3318 (8802) to battle H6635: one H0259 soul H5315 of five H2568 hundred H3967, [both] of the persons H0120, and of the beeves H1241, and of the asses H2543, and of the sheep H6629:
031:029 Take H3947 (8799) [it] of their half H4276, and give H5414 (8804) it unto Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, [for] an heave offering H8641 of the LORD H3068.
031:030 And of the children H1121 of Israel’s H3478 half H4276, thou shalt take H3947 (8799) one H0259 portion H0270 (8803) of fifty H2572, of the persons H0120, of the beeves H1241, of the asses H2543, and of the flocks H6629, of all manner of beasts H0929, and give H5414 (8804) them unto the Levites H3881, which keep H8104 (8802) the charge H4931 of the tabernacle H4908 of the LORD H3068.
031:031 And Moses H4872 and Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548 did H6213 (8799) as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
031:032 And the booty H4455, [being] the rest H3499 of the prey H0957 which the men of H5971 war H6635 had caught H0962 (8804), was six H8337 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 and seventy H7657 thousand H0505 and five H2568 thousand H0505 sheep H6629,
031:033 And threescore and twelve H7657 H8147 thousand H0505 beeves H1241,
031:034 And threescore H8346 and one H0259 thousand H0505 asses H2543,
031:035 And thirty H7970 and two H8147 thousand H0505 persons H5315 H0120 in all H3605, of women H0802 that had not known H3045 (8804) man H2145 by lying H4904 with him.
031:036 And the half H4275, [which was] the portion H2506 of them that went out H3318 (8802) to war H6635, was in number H4557 three H7969 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 and seven H7651 and thirty H7970 thousand H0505 and five H2568 hundred H3967 sheep H6629:
031:037 And the LORD’S H3068 tribute H4371 of the sheep H6629 was six H8337 hundred H3967 and threescore and fifteen H7657 H2568.
031:038 And the beeves H1241 [were] thirty H7970 and six H8337 thousand H0505; of which the LORD’S H3068 tribute H4371 [was] threescore and twelve H7657 H8147.
031:039 And the asses H2543 [were] thirty H7970 thousand H0505 and five H2568 hundred H3967; of which the LORD’S H3068 tribute H4371 [was] threescore H8346 and one H0259.
031:040 And the persons H0120 H5315 [were] sixteen H8337 H6240 thousand H0505; of which the LORD’S H3068 tribute H4371 [was] thirty H7970 and two H8147 persons H5315.
031:041 And Moses H4872 gave H5414 (8799) the tribute H4371, [which was] the LORD’S H3068 heave offering H8641, unto Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
031:042 And of the children H1121 of Israel’s H3478 half H4276, which Moses H4872 divided H2673 (8804) from the men H0582 that warred H6633 (8802),
031:043 (Now the half H4275 [that pertained unto] the congregation H5712 was three H7969 hundred H3967 thousand H0505 and thirty H7970 thousand H0505 [and] seven H7651 thousand H0505 and five H2568 hundred H3967 sheep H4480 H6629,
031:044 And thirty H7970 and six H8337 thousand H0505 beeves H1241,
031:045 And thirty H7970 thousand H0505 asses H2543 and five H2568 hundred H3967,
031:046 And sixteen H8337 H6240 thousand H0505 persons H5315 H0120;)
031:047 Even of the children H1121 of Israel’s H3478 half H4276, Moses H4872 took H3947 (8799) one H0259 portion H0270 (8803) of fifty H2572, [both] of man H0120 and of beast H0929, and gave H5414 (8799) them unto the Levites H3881, which kept H8104 (8802) the charge H4931 of the tabernacle H4908 of the LORD H3068; as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872.
031:048 And the officers H6485 (8803) which [were] over thousands H0505 of the host H6635, the captains H8269 of thousands H0505, and captains H8269 of hundreds H3967, came near H7126 (8799) unto Moses H4872:
031:049 And they said H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, Thy servants H5650 have taken H5375 (8804) the sum H7218 of the men H0582 of war H4421 which [are] under our charge H3027, and there lacketh H6485 (8738) not one man H0376 of us.
031:050 We have therefore brought H7126 (8686) an oblation H7133 for the LORD H3068, what every man H0376 hath gotten H4672 (8804), of jewels H3627 of gold H2091, chains H0685, and bracelets H6781, rings H2885, earrings H5694, and tablets H3558, to make an atonement H3722 (8763) for our souls H5315 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
031:051 And Moses H4872 and Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548 took H3947 (8799) the gold H2091 of them, [even] all wrought H4639 jewels H3627.
031:052 And all the gold H2091 of the offering H8641 that they offered up H7311 (8689) to the LORD H3068, of the captains H8269 of thousands H0505, and of the captains H8269 of hundreds H3967, was sixteen H8337 H6240 thousand H0505 seven H7651 hundred H3967 and fifty H2572 shekels H8255.
031:053 ([For] the men H0582 of war H6635 had taken spoil H0962 (8804), every man H0376 for himself.)
031:054 And Moses H4872 and Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548 took H3947 (8799) the gold H2091 of the captains H8269 of thousands H0505 and of hundreds H3967, and brought H0935 (8686) it into the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, [for] a memorial H2146 for the children H1121 of Israel H3478 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
032:001 ¶  Now the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 and the children H1121 of Gad H1410 had a very H3966 great H6099 multitude H7227 of cattle H4735: and when they saw H7200 (8799) the land H0776 of Jazer H3270, and the land H0776 of Gilead H1568, that, behold, the place H4725 [was] a place H4725 for cattle H4735;
032:002 The children H1121 of Gad H1410 and the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 came H0935 (8799) and spake H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, and to Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and unto the princes H5387 of the congregation H5712, saying H0559 (8800),
032:003 Ataroth H5852, and Dibon H1769, and Jazer H3270, and Nimrah H5247, and Heshbon H2809, and Elealeh H0500, and Shebam H7643, and Nebo H5015, and Beon H1194,
032:004 [Even] the country H0776 which the LORD H3068 smote H5221 (8689) before H6440 the congregation H5712 of Israel H3478, [is] a land H0776 for cattle H4735, and thy servants H5650 have cattle H4735:
032:005 Wherefore, said H0559 (8799) they, if we have found H4672 (8804) grace H2580 in thy sight H5869, let this land H0776 be given H5414 (8714) unto thy servants H5650 for a possession H0272, [and] bring us not over H5674 (8686) Jordan H3383.
032:006 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto the children H1121 of Gad H1410 and to the children H1121 of Reuben H7205, Shall your brethren H0251 go H0935 (8799) to war H4421, and shall ye sit H3427 (8799) here?
032:007 And wherefore discourage ye H5106 (8686) (8675) H5106 (8799) the heart H3820 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 from going over H5674 (8800) into the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8804) them?
032:008 Thus did H6213 (8804) your fathers H0001, when I sent H7971 (8800) them from Kadeshbarnea H6947 to see H7200 (8800) the land H0776.
032:009 For when they went up H5927 (8799) unto the valley H5158 of Eshcol H0812, and saw H7200 (8799) the land H0776, they discouraged H5106 (8686) the heart H3820 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that they should not go H0935 (8800) into the land H0776 which the LORD H3068 had given H5414 (8804) them.
032:010 And the LORD’S H3068 anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799) the same time H3117, and he sware H7650 (8735), saying H0559 (8800),
032:011 Surely H0518 none of the men H0582 that came up H5927 (8802) out of Egypt H4714, from twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 and upward H4605, shall see H7200 (8799) the land H0127 which I sware H7650 (8738) unto Abraham H0085, unto Isaac H3327, and unto Jacob H3290; because they have not wholly H4390 (8765) followed H0310 me:
032:012 Save Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312 the Kenezite H7074, and Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126: for they have wholly H4390 (8765) followed H0310 the LORD H3068.
032:013 And the LORD’S H3068 anger H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799) against Israel H3478, and he made them wander H5128 (8686) in the wilderness H4057 forty H0705 years H8141, until all the generation H1755, that had done H6213 (8802) evil H7451 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068, was consumed H8552 (8800).
032:014 And, behold, ye are risen up H6965 (8804) in your fathers H0001 ’ stead, an increase H8635 of sinful H2400 men H0582, to augment H5595 (8800) yet the fierce H2740 anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 toward Israel H3478.
032:015 For if ye turn away H7725 (8799) from after H0310 him, he will yet again H3254 (8804) leave H3240 (8687) them in the wilderness H4057; and ye shall destroy H7843 (8765) all this people H5971.
032:016 And they came near H5066 (8799) unto him, and said H0559 (8799), We will build H1129 (8799) sheepfolds H1448 H6629 here for our cattle H4735, and cities H5892 for our little ones H2945:
032:017 But we ourselves H0587 will go ready H2363 (8803) armed H2502 (8735) before H6440 the children H1121 of Israel H3478, until we have brought H0935 (8689) them unto their place H4725: and our little ones H2945 shall dwell H3427 (8804) in the fenced H4013 cities H5892 because H6440 of the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776.
032:018 We will not return H7725 (8799) unto our houses H1004, until the children H1121 of Israel H3478 have inherited H5157 (8692) every man H0376 his inheritance H5159.
032:019 For we will not inherit H5157 (8799) with them on yonder side H5676 Jordan H3383, or forward H1973; because our inheritance H5159 is fallen H0935 (8804) to us on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 eastward H4217.
032:020 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto them, If ye will do H6213 (8799) this thing H1697, if ye will go armed H2502 (8735) before H6440 the LORD H3068 to war H4421,
032:021 And will go H5674 all of you armed H2502 (8803) over H5674 (8804) Jordan H3383 before H6440 the LORD H3068, until he hath driven out H3423 (8687) his enemies H0341 (8802) from before H6440 him,
032:022 And the land H0776 be subdued H3533 (8738) before H6440 the LORD H3068: then afterward H0310 ye shall return H7725 (8799), and be guiltless H5355 before the LORD H3068, and before Israel H3478; and this land H0776 shall be your possession H0272 before H6440 the LORD H3068.
032:023 But if ye will not do so H6213 (8799), behold, ye have sinned H2398 (8804) against the LORD H3068: and be sure H3045 (8798) your sin H2403 will find you out H4672 (8799).
032:024 Build H1129 (8798) you cities H5892 for your little ones H2945, and folds H1448 for your sheep H6792; and do H6213 (8799) that which hath proceeded H3318 (8802) out of your mouth H6310.
032:025 And the children H1121 of Gad H1410 and the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 spake H0559 (8799) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800), Thy servants H5650 will do H6213 (8799) as my lord H0113 commandeth H6680 (8764).
032:026 Our little ones H2945, our wives H0802, our flocks H4735, and all our cattle H0929, shall be there in the cities H5892 of Gilead H1568:
032:027 But thy servants H5650 will pass over H5674 (8799), every man armed H2502 (8803) for war H6635, before H6440 the LORD H3068 to battle H4421, as my lord H0113 saith H1696 (8802).
032:028 So concerning them Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8762) Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126, and the chief H7218 fathers H0001 of the tribes H4294 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478:
032:029 And Moses H4872 said H0559 (8799) unto them, If the children H1121 of Gad H1410 and the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 will pass with you over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383, every man armed H2502 (8803) to battle H4421, before H6440 the LORD H3068, and the land H0776 shall be subdued H3533 (8738) before H6440 you; then ye shall give H5414 (8804) them the land H0776 of Gilead H1568 for a possession H0272:
032:030 But if they will not pass over H5674 (8799) with you armed H2502 (8803), they shall have possessions H0270 (8738) among H8432 you in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667.
032:031 And the children H1121 of Gad H1410 and the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 answered H6030 (8799), saying H0559 (8800), As the LORD H3068 hath said H1696 (8765) unto thy servants H5650, so will we do H6213 (8799).
032:032 We will H5168 pass over H5674 (8799) armed H2502 (8803) before H6440 the LORD H3068 into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, that the possession H0272 of our inheritance H5159 on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 [may be] ours.
032:033 And Moses H4872 gave H5414 (8799) unto them, [even] to the children H1121 of Gad H1410, and to the children H1121 of Reuben H7205, and unto half H2677 the tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519 the son H1121 of Joseph H3130, the kingdom H4467 of Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, and the kingdom H4467 of Og H5747 king H4428 of Bashan H1316, the land H0776, with the cities H5892 thereof in the coasts H1367, [even] the cities H5892 of the country H0776 round about H5439.
032:034 And the children H1121 of Gad H1410 built H1129 (8799) Dibon H1769, and Ataroth H5852, and Aroer H6177,
032:035 And Atroth, Shophan H5855, and Jaazer H3270, and Jogbehah H3011,
032:036 And Bethnimrah H1039, and Bethharan H1028, fenced H4013 cities H5892: and folds H1448 for sheep H6629.
032:037 And the children H1121 of Reuben H7205 built H1129 (8804) Heshbon H2809, and Elealeh H0500, and Kirjathaim H7156,
032:038 And Nebo H5015, and Baalmeon H1186, (their names H8034 being changed H4142 (8716),) and Shibmah H7643: and gave H7121 (8799) other names H8034 H8034 unto the cities H5892 which they builded H1129 (8804).
032:039 And the children H1121 of Machir H4353 the son H1121 of Manasseh H4519 went H3212 (8799) to Gilead H1568, and took H3920 (8799) it, and dispossessed H3423 (8686) the Amorite H0567 which [was] in it.
032:040 And Moses H4872 gave H5414 (8799) Gilead H1568 unto Machir H4353 the son H1121 of Manasseh H4519; and he dwelt H3427 (8799) therein.
032:041 And Jair H2971 the son H1121 of Manasseh H4519 went H1980 (8804) and took H3920 (8799) the small towns H2333 thereof, and called H7121 (8799) them Havothjair H2334.
032:042 And Nobah H5025 went H1980 (8804) and took H3920 (8799) Kenath H7079, and the villages H1323 thereof, and called H7121 (8799) it Nobah H5025, after his own name H8034.
033:001 ¶  These [are] the journeys H4550 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, which went forth H3318 (8804) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 with their armies H6635 under the hand H3027 of Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175.
033:002 And Moses H4872 wrote H3789 (8799) their goings out H4161 according to their journeys H4550 by the commandment H6310 of the LORD H3068: and these [are] their journeys H4550 according to their goings out H4161.
033:003 And they departed H5265 (8799) from Rameses H7486 in the first H7223 month H2320, on the fifteenth H6240 H2568 day H3117 of the first H7223 month H2320; on the morrow H4283 after the passover H6453 the children H1121 of Israel H3478 went out H3318 (8804) with an high H7311 (8802) hand H3027 in the sight H5869 of all the Egyptians H4714.
033:004 For the Egyptians H4714 buried H6912 (8764) all [their] firstborn H1060, which the LORD H3068 had smitten H5221 (8689) among them: upon their gods H0430 also the LORD H3068 executed H6213 (8804) judgments H8201.
033:005 And the children H1121 of Israel H3478 removed H5265 (8799) from Rameses H7486, and pitched H2583 (8799) in Succoth H5523.
033:006 And they departed H5265 (8799) from Succoth H5523, and pitched H2583 (8799) in Etham H0864, which [is] in the edge H7097 of the wilderness H4057.

033:051 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When ye are passed over H5674 (8802) Jordan H3383 into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667;
033:052 Then ye shall drive out H3423 (8689) all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776 from before H6440 you, and destroy H0006 (8765) all their pictures H4906, and destroy H0006 (8762) all their molten H4541 images H6754, and quite pluck down H8045 (8686) all their high places H1116:
033:053 And ye shall dispossess H3423 (8689) [the inhabitants] of the land H0776, and dwell H3427 (8804) therein: for I have given H5414 (8804) you the land H0776 to possess H3423 (8800) it.
033:054 And ye shall divide H5157 the land H0776 by lot H1486 for an inheritance H5157 (8694) among your families H4940: [and] to the more H7227 ye shall give the more H7235 (8686) inheritance H5159, and to the fewer H4592 ye shall give the less H4591 (8686) inheritance H5159: every man’s [inheritance] shall be in the place where his lot H1486 falleth H3318 (8799); according to the tribes H4294 of your fathers H0001 ye shall inherit H5157 (8691).
033:055 But if ye will not drive out H3423 (8686) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776 from before H6440 you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain H3498 (8686) of them [shall be] pricks H7899 in your eyes H5869, and thorns H6796 in your sides H6654, and shall vex H6887 (8804) you in the land H0776 wherein ye dwell H3427 (8802).
033:056 Moreover it shall come to pass, [that] I shall do H6213 (8799) unto you, as I thought H1819 (8765) to do H6213 (8800) unto them.
034:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
034:002 Command H6680 (8761) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When ye come H0935 (8802) into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667; (this [is] the land H0776 that shall fall H5307 (8799) unto you for an inheritance H5159, [even] the land H0776 of Canaan H3667 with the coasts H1367 thereof:)
034:003 Then your south H5045 quarter H6285 shall be from the wilderness H4057 of Zin H6790 along by the coast H3027 of Edom H0123, and your south H5045 border H1366 shall be the outmost coast H7097 of the salt H4417 sea H3220 eastward H6924:
034:004 And your border H1366 shall turn H5437 (8738) from the south H5045 to the ascent H4608 of Akrabbim H4610, and pass on H5674 (8804) to Zin H6790: and the going forth H8444 thereof shall be from the south H5045 to Kadeshbarnea H6947, and shall go on H3318 (8804) to Hazaraddar H2692, and pass on H5674 (8804) to Azmon H6111:
034:005 And the border H1366 shall fetch a compass H5437 (8738) from Azmon H6111 unto the river H5158 of Egypt H4714, and the goings out H8444 of it shall be at the sea H3220.
034:006 And [as for] the western H3220 border H1366, ye shall even have the great H1419 sea H3220 for a border H1366: this shall be your west H3220 border H1366.
034:007 And this shall be your north H6828 border H1366: from the great H1419 sea H3220 ye shall point out H8376 (8762) for you mount H2022 Hor H2023:
034:008 From mount H2022 Hor H2023 ye shall point out H8376 (8762) [your border] unto the entrance H0935 (8800) of Hamath H2574; and the goings forth H8444 of the border H1366 shall be to Zedad H6657:
034:009 And the border H1366 shall go on H3318 (8804) to Ziphron H2202, and the goings out H8444 of it shall be at Hazarenan H2704: this shall be your north H6828 border H1366.
034:010 And ye shall point out H0184 (8694) your east H6924 border H1366 from Hazarenan H2704 to Shepham H8221:
034:011 And the coast H1366 shall go down H3381 (8804) from Shepham H8221 to Riblah H7247, on the east side H6924 of Ain H5871; and the border H1366 shall descend H3381 (8804), and shall reach H4229 (8804) unto the side H3802 of the sea H3220 of Chinnereth H3672 eastward H6924:
034:012 And the border H1366 shall go down H3381 (8804) to Jordan H3383, and the goings out H8444 of it shall be at the salt H4417 sea H3220: this shall be your land H0776 with the coasts H1367 thereof round about H5439.
034:013 And Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8762) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saying H0559 (8800), This [is] the land H0776 which ye shall inherit H5157 (8691) by lot H1486, which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) to give H5414 (8800) unto the nine H8672 tribes H4294, and to the half H2677 tribe H4294:
034:014 For the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Reuben H7206 according to the house H1004 of their fathers H0001, and the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Gad H1425 according to the house H1004 of their fathers H0001, have received H3947 (8804) [their inheritance]; and half H2677 the tribe H4294 of Manasseh H4519 have received H3947 (8804) their inheritance H5159:
034:015 The two H8147 tribes H4294 and the half H2677 tribe H4294 have received H3947 (8804) their inheritance H5159 on this side H5676 Jordan H3383 [near] Jericho H3405 eastward H6924, toward the sunrising H4217.
034:016 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
034:017 These [are] the names H8034 of the men H0582 which shall divide H5157 (8799) the land H0776 unto you: Eleazar H0499 the priest H3548, and Joshua H3091 the son H1121 of Nun H5126.
034:018 And ye shall take H3947 (8799) one H0259 prince H5387 of every tribe H4294, to divide H5157 the land H0776 by inheritance H5157 (8800).
034:019 And the names H8034 of the men H0582 [are] these: Of the tribe H4294 of Judah H3063, Caleb H3612 the son H1121 of Jephunneh H3312.
034:020 And of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Simeon H8095, Shemuel H8050 the son H1121 of Ammihud H5989.
034:021 Of the tribe H4294 of Benjamin H1144, Elidad H0449 the son H1121 of Chislon H3692.
034:022 And the prince H5387 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Dan H1835, Bukki H1231 the son H1121 of Jogli H3020.
034:023 The prince H5387 of the children H1121 of Joseph H3130, for the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Manasseh H4519, Hanniel H2592 the son H1121 of Ephod H0641.
034:024 And the prince H5387 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Ephraim H0669, Kemuel H7055 the son H1121 of Shiphtan H8204.
034:025 And the prince H5387 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Zebulun H2074, Elizaphan H0469 the son H1121 of Parnach H6535.
034:026 And the prince H5387 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Issachar H3485, Paltiel H6409 the son H1121 of Azzan H5821.
034:027 And the prince H5387 of the tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Asher H0836, Ahihud H0282 the son H1121 of Shelomi H8015.

034:029 These [are they] whom the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) to divide the inheritance H5157 (8763) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478 in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667.
035:001 ¶  And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872 in the plains H6160 of Moab H4124 by Jordan H3383 [near] Jericho H3405, saying H0559 (8800),
035:002 Command H6680 (8761) the children H1121 of Israel H3478, that they give H5414 (8804) unto the Levites H3881 of the inheritance H5159 of their possession H0272 cities H5892 to dwell in H3427 (8800); and ye shall give H5414 (8799) [also] unto the Levites H3881 suburbs H4054 for the cities H5892 round about H5439 them.
035:003 And the cities H5892 shall they have to dwell in H3427 (8800); and the suburbs H4054 of them shall be for their cattle H0929, and for their goods H7399, and for all their beasts H2416.
035:004 And the suburbs H4054 of the cities H5892, which ye shall give H5414 (8799) unto the Levites H3881, [shall reach] from the wall H7023 of the city H5892 and outward H2351 a thousand H0505 cubits H0520 round about H5439.
035:005 And ye shall measure H4058 (8804) from without H2351 the city H5892 on the east H6924 side H6285 two thousand H0505 cubits H0520, and on the south H5045 side H6285 two thousand H0505 cubits H0520, and on the west H3220 side H6285 two thousand H0505 cubits H0520, and on the north H6828 side H6285 two thousand H0505 cubits H0520; and the city H5892 [shall be] in the midst H8432: this shall be to them the suburbs H4054 of the cities H5892.
035:006 And among the cities H5892 which ye shall give H5414 (8799) unto the Levites H3881 [there shall be] six H8337 cities H5892 for refuge H4733, which ye shall appoint H5414 (8799) for the manslayer H7523 (8802), that he may flee H5127 (8800) thither: and to them ye shall add H5414 (8799) forty H0705 and two H8147 cities H5892.
035:007 [So] all the cities H5892 which ye shall give H5414 (8799) to the Levites H3881 [shall be] forty H0705 and eight H8083 cities H5892: them [shall ye give] with their suburbs H4054.
035:008 And the cities H5892 which ye shall give H5414 (8799) [shall be] of the possession H0272 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478: from [them that have] many H7227 ye shall give many H7235 (8686); but from [them that have] few H4592 ye shall give few H4591 (8686): every one H0376 shall give H5414 (8799) of his cities H5892 unto the Levites H3881 according H6310 to his inheritance H5159 which he inheriteth H5157 (8799).
035:009 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Moses H4872, saying H0559 (8800),
035:010 Speak H1696 (8761) unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and say H0559 (8804) unto them, When ye be come over H5674 (8802) Jordan H3383 into the land H0776 of Canaan H3667;
035:011 Then ye shall appoint H7136 (8689) you cities H5892 to be cities H5892 of refuge H4733 for you; that the slayer H7523 (8802) may flee H5127 (8804) thither, which killeth H5221 (8688) any person H5315 at unawares H7684.
035:012 And they shall be unto you cities H5892 for refuge H4733 from the avenger H1350 (8802); that the manslayer H7523 (8802) die H4191 (8799) not, until he stand H5975 (8800) before H6440 the congregation H5712 in judgment H4941.
035:013 And of these cities H5892 which ye shall give H5414 (8799) six H8337 cities H5892 shall ye have for refuge H4733.
035:014 Ye shall give H5414 (8799) three H7969 cities H5892 on this side H5676 Jordan H3383, and three H7969 cities H5892 shall ye give H5414 (8799) in the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, [which] shall be cities H5892 of refuge H4733.
035:015 These six H8337 cities H5892 shall be a refuge H4733, [both] for the children H1121 of Israel H3478, and for the stranger H1616, and for the sojourner H8453 among H8432 them: that every one that killeth H5221 (8688) any person H5315 unawares H7684 may flee H5127 (8800) thither.
035:016 And if he smite H5221 (8689) him with an instrument H3627 of iron H1270, so that he die H4191 (8799), he [is] a murderer H7523 (8802): the murderer H7523 (8802) shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714).
035:017 And if he smite H5221 (8689) him with throwing H3027 a stone H0068, wherewith he may die H4191 (8799), and he die H4191 (8799), he [is] a murderer H7523 (8802): the murderer H7523 (8802) shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714).
035:018 Or [if] he smite H5221 (8689) him with an hand H3027 weapon H3627 of wood H6086, wherewith he may die H4191 (8799), and he die H4191 (8799), he [is] a murderer H7523 (8802): the murderer H7523 (8802) shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714).
035:019 The revenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818 himself shall slay H4191 (8686) the murderer H7523 (8802): when he meeteth H6293 (8800) him, he H1931 shall slay H4191 (8686) him.
035:020 But if he thrust H1920 (8799) him of hatred H8135, or hurl H7993 (8689) at him by laying of wait H6660, that he die H4191 (8799);
035:021 Or in enmity H0342 smite H5221 (8689) him with his hand H3027, that he die H4191 (8799): he that smote H5221 (8688) [him] shall surely H4191 (8800) be put to death H4191 (8714); [for] he [is] a murderer H7523 (8802): the revenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818 shall slay H4191 (8686) the murderer H7523 (8802), when he meeteth H6293 (8800) him.
035:022 But if he thrust H1920 (8804) him suddenly H6621 without H3808 enmity H0342, or have cast H7993 (8689) upon him any thing H3627 without laying of wait H6660,
035:023 Or with any stone H0068, wherewith a man may die H4191 (8799), seeing H7200 (8800) [him] not H3808, and cast H5307 (8686) [it] upon him, that he die H4191 (8799), and [was] not his enemy H0341 (8802), neither sought H1245 (8764) his harm H7451:
035:024 Then the congregation H5712 shall judge H8199 (8804) between the slayer H5221 (8688) and the revenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818 according to these judgments H4941:
035:025 And the congregation H5712 shall deliver H5337 (8689) the slayer H7523 (8802) out of the hand H3027 of the revenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818, and the congregation H5712 shall restore H7725 (8689) him to the city H5892 of his refuge H4733, whither he was fled H5127 (8804): and he shall abide H3427 (8804) in it unto the death H4194 of the high H1419 priest H3548, which was anointed H4886 (8804) with the holy H6944 oil H8081.
035:026 But if the slayer H7523 (8802) shall at any time H3318 (8800) come H3318 (8799) without the border H1366 of the city H5892 of his refuge H4733, whither he was fled H5127 (8799);
035:027 And the revenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818 find H4672 (8804) him without H2351 the borders H1366 of the city H5892 of his refuge H4733, and the revenger H1350 (8802) of blood H1818 kill H7523 (8804) the slayer H7523 (8802); he shall not be guilty of blood H1818:
035:028 Because he should have remained H3427 (8799) in the city H5892 of his refuge H4733 until the death H4194 of the high H1419 priest H3548: but after H0310 the death H4194 of the high H1419 priest H3548 the slayer H7523 (8802) shall return H7725 (8799) into the land H0776 of his possession H0272.
035:029 So these [things] shall be for a statute H2708 of judgment H4941 unto you throughout your generations H1755 in all your dwellings H4186.
035:030 Whoso killeth H5221 (8688) any person H5315, the murderer H7523 (8802) shall be put to death H7523 (8799) by the mouth H6310 of witnesses H5707: but one H0259 witness H5707 shall not testify H6030 (8799) against any person H5315 [to cause him] to die H4191 (8800).
035:031 Moreover ye shall take H3947 (8799) no satisfaction H3724 for the life H5315 of a murderer H7523 (8802), which [is] guilty H7563 of death H4191 (8800): but he shall be surely H4191 (8800) put to death H4191 (8714).
035:032 And ye shall take H3947 (8799) no satisfaction H3724 for him that is fled H5127 (8800) to the city H5892 of his refuge H4733, that he should come again H7725 (8800) to dwell H3427 (8800) in the land H0776, until the death H4194 of the priest H3548.
035:033 So ye shall not pollute H2610 (8686) the land H0776 wherein ye [are]: for blood H1818 it defileth H2610 (8686) the land H0776: and the land H0776 cannot be cleansed H3722 (8792) of the blood H1818 that is shed H8210 (8795) therein, but by the blood H1818 of him that shed H8210 (8802) it.
035:034 Defile H2930 (8762) not therefore the land H0776 which ye shall inhabit H3427 (8802), wherein H8432 I dwell H7931 (8802): for I the LORD H3068 dwell H7931 (8802) among H8432 the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
036:001 ¶  And the chief H7218 fathers H0001 of the families H4940 of the children H1121 of Gilead H1568, the son H1121 of Machir H4353, the son H1121 of Manasseh H4519, of the families H4940 of the sons H1121 of Joseph H3130, came near H7126 (8799), and spake H1696 (8762) before H6440 Moses H4872, and before H6440 the princes H5387, the chief H7218 fathers H0001 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478:
036:002 And they said H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) my lord H0113 to give H5414 (8800) the land H0776 for an inheritance H5159 by lot H1486 to the children H1121 of Israel H3478: and my lord H0113 was commanded H6680 (8795) by the LORD H3068 to give H5414 (8800) the inheritance H5159 of Zelophehad H6765 our brother H0251 unto his daughters H1323.
036:003 And if they be married H0802 to any H0259 of the sons H1121 of the [other] tribes H7626 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, then shall their inheritance H5159 be taken H1639 (8738) from the inheritance H5159 of our fathers H0001, and shall be put H3254 (8738) to the inheritance H5159 of the tribe H4294 whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken H1639 (8735) from the lot H1486 of our inheritance H5159.
036:004 And when the jubile H3104 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 shall be, then shall their inheritance H5159 be put H3254 (8738) unto the inheritance H5159 of the tribe H4294 whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance H5159 be taken away H1639 (8735) from the inheritance H5159 of the tribe H4294 of our fathers H0001.
036:005 And Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8762) the children H1121 of Israel H3478 according to the word H6310 of the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), The tribe H4294 of the sons H1121 of Joseph H3130 hath said H1696 (8802) well.
036:006 This [is] the thing H1697 which the LORD H3068 doth command H6680 (8765) concerning the daughters H1323 of Zelophehad H6765, saying H0559 (8800), Let them marry H0802 to whom they think H5869 best H2896; only to the family H4940 of the tribe H4294 of their father H0001 shall they marry H0802.
036:007 So shall not the inheritance H5159 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 remove H5437 (8735) from tribe H4294 to tribe H4294: for every one H0376 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 shall keep H1692 (8799) himself to the inheritance H5159 of the tribe H4294 of his fathers H0001.
036:008 And every daughter H1323, that possesseth H3423 (8802) an inheritance H5159 in any tribe H4294 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, shall be wife H0802 unto one H0259 of the family H4940 of the tribe H4294 of her father H0001, that the children H1121 of Israel H3478 may enjoy H3423 (8799) every man H0376 the inheritance H5159 of his fathers H0001.
036:009 Neither shall the inheritance H5159 remove H5437 (8735) from [one] tribe H4294 to another H0312 tribe H4294; but every one H0376 of the tribes H4294 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478 shall keep H1692 (8799) himself to his own inheritance H5159.
036:010 Even as the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) Moses H4872, so did H6213 (8804) the daughters H1323 of Zelophehad H6765:
036:011 For Mahlah H4244, Tirzah H8656, and Hoglah H2295, and Milcah H4435, and Noah H5270, the daughters H1323 of Zelophehad H6765, were married H0802 unto their father’s H1730 brothers’ sons H1121:
036:012 [And] they were married H0802 into the families H4940 of the sons H1121 of Manasseh H4519 the son H1121 of Joseph H3130, and their inheritance H5159 remained in the tribe H4294 of the family H4940 of their father H0001.
036:013 These [are] the commandments H4687 and the judgments H4941, which the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872 unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478 in the plains H6160 of Moab H4124 by Jordan H3383 [near] Jericho H3405.
