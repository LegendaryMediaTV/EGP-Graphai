001:001 ¶  Blessed H0835 [is] the man H0376 that walketh H1980 (8804) not in the counsel H6098 of the ungodly H7563, nor standeth H5975 (8804) in the way H1870 of sinners H2400, nor sitteth H3427 (8804) in the seat H4186 of the scornful H3887 (8801).
001:002 But his delight H2656 [is] in the law H8451 of the LORD H3068; and in his law H8451 doth he meditate H1897 (8799) day H3119 and night H3915.
001:003 And he shall be like a tree H6086 planted H8362 (8803) by the rivers H6388 of water H4325, that bringeth forth H5414 (8799) his fruit H6529 in his season H6256; his leaf H5929 also shall not wither H5034 (8799); and whatsoever he doeth H6213 (8799) shall prosper H6743 (8686).
001:004 The ungodly H7563 [are] not so: but [are] like the chaff H4671 which the wind H7307 driveth away H5086 (8799).
001:005 Therefore the ungodly H7563 shall not stand H6965 (8799) in the judgment H4941, nor sinners H2400 in the congregation H5712 of the righteous H6662.
001:006 For the LORD H3068 knoweth H3045 (8802) the way H1870 of the righteous H6662: but the way H1870 of the ungodly H7563 shall perish H0006 (8799).
002:001 ¶  Why do the heathen H1471 rage H7283 (8804), and the people H3816 imagine H1897 (8799) a vain thing H7385?
002:002 The kings H4428 of the earth H0776 set H3320 (8691) themselves, and the rulers H7336 (8802) take counsel H3245 (8738) together H3162, against the LORD H3068, and against his anointed H4899, [saying],
002:003 Let us break H5423 their bands H4147 asunder H5423 (8762), and cast away H7993 (8686) their cords H5688 from us.
002:004 He that sitteth H3427 (8802) in the heavens H8064 shall laugh H7832 (8799): the Lord H0136 shall have them in derision H3932 (8799).
002:005 Then shall he speak H1696 (8762) unto them in his wrath H0639, and vex H0926 (8762) them in his sore displeasure H2740.
002:006 Yet have I set H5258 (8804) my king H4428 upon my holy H6944 hill H2022 of Zion H6726.
002:007 I will declare H5608 (8762) the decree H2706: the LORD H3068 hath said H0559 (8804) unto me, Thou [art] my Son H1121; this day H3117 have I begotten H3205 (8804) thee.
002:008 Ask H7592 (8798) of me, and I shall give H5414 (8799) [thee] the heathen H1471 [for] thine inheritance H5159, and the uttermost parts H0657 of the earth H0776 [for] thy possession H0272.
002:009 Thou shalt break H7489 (8799) them with a rod H7626 of iron H1270; thou shalt dash them in pieces H5310 (8762) like a potter’s H3335 (8802) vessel H3627.
002:010 Be wise H7919 (8685) now therefore, O ye kings H4428: be instructed H3256 (8734), ye judges H8199 (8802) of the earth H0776.
002:011 Serve H5647 (8798) the LORD H3068 with fear H3374, and rejoice H1523 (8798) with trembling H7461.
002:012 Kiss H5401 (8761) the Son H1248, lest he be angry H0599 (8799), and ye perish H0006 (8799) [from] the way H1870, when his wrath H0639 is kindled H1197 (8799) but a little H4592. Blessed H0835 [are] all they that put their trust H2620 (8802) in him.
003:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732, when he fled H1272 (8800) from H6440 Absalom H0053 his son H1121.» LORD H3068, how are they increased H7231 (8804) that trouble H6862 me! many H7227 [are] they that rise up H6965 (8801) against me.
003:002 Many H7227 [there be] which say H0559 (8802) of my soul H5315, [There is] no help H3444 for him in God H0430. Selah H5542.
003:003 But thou, O LORD H3068, [art] a shield H4043 for me; my glory H3519, and the lifter up H7311 (8688) of mine head H7218.
003:004 I cried H7121 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 with my voice H6963, and he heard H6030 (8799) me out of his holy H6944 hill H2022. Selah H5542.
003:005 I laid me down H7901 (8804) and slept H3462 (8799); I awaked H6974 (8689); for the LORD H3068 sustained H5564 (8799) me.
003:006 I will not be afraid H3372 (8799) of ten thousands H7233 of people H5971, that have set H7896 (8804) [themselves] against me round about H5439.
003:007 Arise H6965 (8798), O LORD H3068; save H3467 (8685) me, O my God H0430: for thou hast smitten H5221 (8689) all mine enemies H0341 (8802) [upon] the cheek bone H3895; thou hast broken H7665 (8765) the teeth H8127 of the ungodly H7563.
003:008 Salvation H3444 [belongeth] unto the LORD H3068: thy blessing H1293 [is] upon thy people H5971. Selah H5542.
004:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) on Neginoth H5058, A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Hear H6030 (8798) me when I call H7121 (8800), O God H0430 of my righteousness H6664: thou hast enlarged H7337 (8689) me [when I was] in distress H6862; have mercy H2603 (8798) upon me, and hear H8085 (8798) my prayer H8605.
004:002 O ye sons H1121 of men H0376, how long H5704 [will ye turn] my glory H3519 into shame H3639? [how long] will ye love H0157 (8799) vanity H7385, [and] seek H1245 (8762) after leasing H3577? Selah H5542.
004:003 But know H3045 (8798) that the LORD H3068 hath set apart H6395 (8689) him that is godly H2623 for himself: the LORD H3068 will hear H8085 (8799) when I call H7121 (8800) unto him.
004:004 Stand in awe H7264 (8798), and sin H2398 (8799) not: commune H0559 (8798) with your own heart H3824 upon your bed H4904, and be still H1826 (8798). Selah H5542.
004:005 Offer H2076 (8798) the sacrifices H2077 of righteousness H6664, and put your trust H0982 (8798) in the LORD H3068.
004:006 [There be] many H7227 that say H0559 (8802), Who will shew H7200 (8686) us [any] good H2896? LORD H3068, lift thou up H5375 (8798) the light H0216 of thy countenance H6440 upon us.
004:007 Thou hast put H5414 (8804) gladness H8057 in my heart H3820, more than in the time H6256 [that] their corn H1715 and their wine H8492 increased H7231 (8804).
004:008 I will both H3162 lay me down H7901 (8799) in peace H7965, and sleep H3462 (8799): for thou, LORD H3068, only H0910 makest me dwell H3427 (8686) in safety H0983.
005:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Nehiloth H5155, A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Give ear H0238 (8685) to my words H0561, O LORD H3068, consider H0995 (8798) my meditation H1901.
005:002 Hearken H7181 (8685) unto the voice H6963 of my cry H7773, my King H4428, and my God H0430: for unto thee will I pray H6419 (8691).
005:003 My voice H6963 shalt thou hear H8085 (8799) in the morning H1242, O LORD H3068; in the morning H1242 will I direct H6186 (8799) [my prayer] unto thee, and will look up H6822 (8762).
005:004 For thou [art] not a God H0410 that hath pleasure H2655 in wickedness H7562: neither shall evil H7451 dwell H1481 (8799) with thee.
005:005 The foolish H1984 (8802) shall not stand H3320 (8691) in thy sight H5869: thou hatest H8130 (8804) all workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205.
005:006 Thou shalt destroy H0006 (8762) them that speak H1696 (8802) leasing H3577: the LORD H3068 will abhor H8581 (8762) the bloody H1818 and deceitful H4820 man H0376.
005:007 But as for me, I will come H0935 (8799) [into] thy house H1004 in the multitude H7230 of thy mercy H2617: [and] in thy fear H3374 will I worship H7812 (8691) toward thy holy H6944 temple H1964.
005:008 Lead H5148 (8798) me, O LORD H3068, in thy righteousness H6666 because of mine enemies H8324 (8802); make thy way H1870 straight H3474 (8685) before my face H6440.
005:009 For [there is] no faithfulness H3559 (8737) in their mouth H6310; their inward H7130 part [is] very wickedness H1942; their throat H1627 [is] an open H6605 (8803) sepulchre H6913; they flatter H2505 (8686) with their tongue H3956.
005:010 Destroy H0816 (8685) thou them, O God H0430; let them fall H5307 (8799) by their own counsels H4156; cast them out H5080 (8685) in the multitude H7230 of their transgressions H6588; for they have rebelled H4784 (8804) against thee.
005:011 But let all those that put their trust H2620 (8802) in thee rejoice H8055 (8799): let them ever H5769 shout for joy H7442 (8762), because thou defendest H5526 (8686) them: let them also that love H0157 (8802) thy name H8034 be joyful H5970 (8799) in thee.
005:012 For thou, LORD H3068, wilt bless H1288 (8762) the righteous H6662; with favour H7522 wilt thou compass H5849 (8799) him as [with] a shield H6793.
006:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) on Neginoth H5058 upon Sheminith H8067, A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» O LORD H3068, rebuke H3198 (8686) me not in thine anger H0639, neither chasten H3256 (8762) me in thy hot displeasure H2534.
006:002 Have mercy H2603 (8798) upon me, O LORD H3068; for I [am] weak H0536: O LORD H3068, heal H7495 (8798) me; for my bones H6106 are vexed H0926 (8738).
006:003 My soul H5315 is also sore H3966 vexed H0926 (8738): but thou, O LORD H3068, how long?
006:004 Return H7725 (8798), O LORD H3068, deliver H2502 (8761) my soul H5315: oh save H3467 (8685) me for thy mercies H2617 ’ sake.
006:005 For in death H4194 [there is] no remembrance H2143 of thee: in the grave H7585 who shall give thee thanks H3034 (8686)?
006:006 I am weary H3021 (8804) with my groaning H0585; all the night H3915 make I my bed H4296 to swim H7811 (8686); I water H4529 (8686) my couch H6210 with my tears H1832.
006:007 Mine eye H5869 is consumed H6244 (8804) because of grief H3708; it waxeth old H6275 (8804) because of all mine enemies H6887 (8802).
006:008 Depart H5493 (8798) from me, all ye workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205; for the LORD H3068 hath heard H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of my weeping H1065.
006:009 The LORD H3068 hath heard H8085 (8804) my supplication H8467; the LORD H3068 will receive H3947 (8799) my prayer H8605.
006:010 Let all mine enemies H0341 (8802) be ashamed H0954 (8799) and sore H3966 vexed H0926 (8735): let them return H7725 (8799) [and] be ashamed H0954 (8799) suddenly H7281.
007:001 ¶  «Shiggaion H7692 of David H1732, which he sang H7891 (8804) unto the LORD H3068, concerning the words H1697 of Cush H3568 the Benjamite H1121 H1145.» O LORD H3068 my God H0430, in thee do I put my trust H2620 (8804): save H3467 (8685) me from all them that persecute H7291 (8802) me, and deliver H5337 (8685) me:
007:002 Lest he tear H2963 (8799) my soul H5315 like a lion H0738, rending [it] in pieces H6561 (8802), while [there is] none to deliver H5337 (8688).
007:003 O LORD H3068 my God H0430, if I have done H6213 (8804) this; if there be H3426 iniquity H5766 in my hands H3709;
007:004 If I have rewarded H1580 (8804) evil H7451 unto him that was at peace H7999 (8802) with me; (yea, I have delivered H2502 (8762) him that without cause H7387 is mine enemy H6887 (8802):)
007:005 Let the enemy H0341 (8802) persecute H7291 (8762) my soul H5315, and take H5381 (8686) [it]; yea, let him tread down H7429 (8799) my life H2416 upon the earth H0776, and lay H7931 (8686) mine honour H3519 in the dust H6083. Selah H5542.
007:006 Arise H6965 (8798), O LORD H3068, in thine anger H0639, lift up H5375 (8734) thyself because of the rage H5678 of mine enemies H6887 (8802): and awake H5782 (8798) for me [to] the judgment H4941 [that] thou hast commanded H6680 (8765).
007:007 So shall the congregation H5712 of the people H3816 compass thee about H5437 (8779): for their sakes therefore return H7725 (8798) thou on high H4791.
007:008 The LORD H3068 shall judge H1777 (8799) the people H5971: judge H8199 (8798) me, O LORD H3068, according to my righteousness H6664, and according to mine integrity H8537 [that is] in me.
007:009 Oh let the wickedness H7451 of the wicked H7563 come to an end H1584 (8799); but establish H3559 (8787) the just H6662: for the righteous H6662 God H0430 trieth H0974 (8802) the hearts H3826 and reins H3629.
007:010 My defence H4043 [is] of God H0430, which saveth H3467 (8688) the upright H3477 in heart H3820.
007:011 God H0430 judgeth H8199 (8802) the righteous H6662, and God H0410 is angry H2194 (8802) [with the wicked] every day H3117.
007:012 If he turn H7725 (8799) not, he will whet H3913 (8799) his sword H2719; he hath bent H1869 (8804) his bow H7198, and made it ready H3559 (8787).
007:013 He hath also prepared H3559 (8689) for him the instruments H3627 of death H4194; he ordaineth H6466 (8799) his arrows H2671 against the persecutors H1814 (8801).
007:014 Behold, he travaileth H2254 (8762) with iniquity H0205, and hath conceived H2029 (8804) mischief H5999, and brought forth H3205 (8804) falsehood H8267.
007:015 He made H3738 (8804) a pit H0953, and digged H2658 (8799) it, and is fallen H5307 (8799) into the ditch H7845 [which] he made H6466 (8799).
007:016 His mischief H5999 shall return H7725 (8799) upon his own head H7218, and his violent H2555 dealing shall come down H3381 (8799) upon his own pate H6936.
007:017 I will praise H3034 (8686) the LORD H3068 according to his righteousness H6664: and will sing praise H2167 (8762) to the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 most high H5945.
008:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Gittith H1665, A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» O LORD H3068 our Lord H0113, how excellent H0117 [is] thy name H8034 in all the earth H0776! who hast set H5414 (8798) thy glory H1935 above H5921 the heavens H8064.
008:002 Out of the mouth H6310 of babes H5768 and sucklings H3243 (8802) hast thou ordained H3245 (8765) strength H5797 because of thine enemies H6887 (8802), that thou mightest still H7673 (8687) the enemy H0341 (8802) and the avenger H5358 (8693).
008:003 When I consider H7200 (8799) thy heavens H8064, the work H4639 of thy fingers H0676, the moon H3394 and the stars H3556, which thou hast ordained H3559 (8790);
008:004 What is man H0582, that thou art mindful H2142 (8799) of him? and the son H1121 of man H0120, that thou visitest H6485 (8799) him?
008:005 For thou hast made him a little H4592 lower H2637 (8762) than the angels H0430, and hast crowned H5849 (8762) him with glory H3519 and honour H1926.
008:006 Thou madest him to have dominion H4910 (8686) over the works H4639 of thy hands H3027; thou hast put H7896 (8804) all [things] under his feet H7272:
008:007 All sheep H6792 and oxen H0504, yea, and the beasts H0929 of the field H7704;
008:008 The fowl H6833 of the air H8064, and the fish H1709 of the sea H3220, [and whatsoever] passeth through H5674 (8802) the paths H0734 of the seas H3220.
008:009 O LORD H3068 our Lord H0113, how excellent H0117 [is] thy name H8034 in all the earth H0776!
009:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Muthlabben H4192 H1121, A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» I will praise H3034 (8686) [thee], O LORD H3068, with my whole heart H3820; I will shew forth H5608 (8762) all thy marvellous works H6381 (8737).
009:002 I will be glad H8055 (8799) and rejoice H5970 (8799) in thee: I will sing praise H2167 (8762) to thy name H8034, O thou most High H5945.
009:003 When mine enemies H0341 (8802) are turned H7725 (8800) back H0268, they shall fall H3782 (8735) and perish H0006 (8799) at thy presence H6440.
009:004 For thou hast maintained H6213 (8804) my right H4941 and my cause H1779; thou satest H3427 (8804) in the throne H3678 judging H8199 (8802) right H6664.
009:005 Thou hast rebuked H1605 (8804) the heathen H1471, thou hast destroyed H0006 (8765) the wicked H7563, thou hast put out H4229 (8804) their name H8034 for ever H5769 and ever H5703.
009:006 O thou enemy H0341 (8802), destructions H2723 are come to a perpetual H5331 end H8552 (8804): and thou hast destroyed H5428 (8804) cities H6145 (8676) H5892; their memorial H2143 is perished H0006 (8804) with them H1992.
009:007 But the LORD H3068 shall endure H3427 (8799) for ever H5769: he hath prepared H3559 (8790) his throne H3678 for judgment H4941.
009:008 And he shall judge H8199 (8799) the world H8398 in righteousness H6664, he shall minister judgment H1777 (8799) to the people H3816 in uprightness H4339.
009:009 The LORD H3068 also will be a refuge H4869 for the oppressed H1790, a refuge H4869 in times H6256 of trouble H6869.
009:010 And they that know H3045 (8802) thy name H8034 will put their trust H0982 (8799) in thee: for thou, LORD H3068, hast not forsaken H5800 (8804) them that seek H1875 (8802) thee.
009:011 Sing praises H2167 (8761) to the LORD H3068, which dwelleth H3427 (8802) in Zion H6726: declare H5046 (8685) among the people H5971 his doings H5949.
009:012 When he maketh inquisition H1875 (8802) for blood H1818, he remembereth H2142 (8804) them: he forgetteth H7911 (8804) not the cry H6818 of the humble H6035 (8675) H6041.
009:013 Have mercy H2603 (8798) upon me, O LORD H3068; consider H7200 (8798) my trouble H6040 [which I suffer] of them that hate H8130 (8802) me, thou that liftest me up H7311 (8789) from the gates H8179 of death H4194:
009:014 That I may shew forth H5608 (8762) all thy praise H8416 in the gates H8179 of the daughter H1323 of Zion H6726: I will rejoice H1523 (8799) in thy salvation H3444.
009:015 The heathen H1471 are sunk down H2883 (8804) in the pit H7845 [that] they made H6213 (8804): in the net H7568 which H2098 they hid H2934 (8804) is their own foot H7272 taken H3920 (8738).
009:016 The LORD H3068 is known H3045 (8738) [by] the judgment H4941 [which] he executeth H6213 (8804): the wicked H7563 is snared H5367 (8804) in the work H6467 of his own hands H3709. Higgaion H1902. Selah H5542.
009:017 The wicked H7563 shall be turned H7725 (8799) into hell H7585, [and] all the nations H1471 that forget H7913 God H0430.
009:018 For the needy H0034 shall not alway H5331 be forgotten H7911 (8735): the expectation H8615 of the poor H6041 (8675) H6035 shall [not] perish H0006 (8799) for ever H5703.
009:019 Arise H6965 (8798), O LORD H3068; let not man H0582 prevail H5810 (8799): let the heathen H1471 be judged H8199 (8735) in thy sight H6440.
009:020 Put H7896 (8798) them in fear H4172 (8675) H4172, O LORD H3068: [that] the nations H1471 may know H3045 (8799) themselves [to be but] men H0582. Selah H5542.
010:001 ¶  Why standest H5975 (8799) thou afar off H7350, O LORD H3068? [why] hidest H5956 (8686) thou [thyself] in times H6256 of trouble H6869?
010:002 The wicked H7563 in [his] pride H1346 doth persecute H1814 (8799) the poor H6041: let them be taken H8610 (8735) in the devices H4209 that H2098 they have imagined H2803 (8804).
010:003 For the wicked H7563 boasteth H1984 (8765) of his heart’s H5315 desire H8378, and blesseth H1288 (8765) the covetous H1214 (8802), [whom] the LORD H3068 abhorreth H5006 (8765).
010:004 The wicked H7563, through the pride H1363 of his countenance H0639, will not seek H1875 (8799) [after God]: God H0430 [is] not in all his thoughts H4209.
010:005 His ways H1870 are always H6256 grievous H2342 (8799); thy judgments H4941 [are] far above H4791 out of his sight: [as for] all his enemies H6887 (8802), he puffeth H6315 (8686) at them.
010:006 He hath said H0559 (8804) in his heart H3820, I shall not be moved H4131 (8735): for [I shall] never H1755 H1755 [be] in adversity H7451.
010:007 His mouth H6310 is full H4390 (8804) of cursing H0423 and deceit H4820 and fraud H8496: under his tongue H3956 [is] mischief H5999 and vanity H0205.
010:008 He sitteth H3427 (8799) in the lurking places H3993 of the villages H2691: in the secret places H4565 doth he murder H2026 (8799) the innocent H5355: his eyes H5869 are privily set H6845 (8799) against the poor H2489.
010:009 He lieth in wait H0693 (8799) secretly H4565 as a lion H0738 in his den H5520: he lieth in wait H0693 (8799) to catch H2414 (8800) the poor H6041: he doth catch H2414 (8799) the poor H6041, when he draweth H4900 (8800) him into his net H7568.
010:010 He croucheth H1794 (8799), [and] humbleth H7817 (8799) himself, that the poor H2426 (8675) H2489 (8676) H2489 may fall H5307 (8804) by his strong ones H6099.
010:011 He hath said H0559 (8804) in his heart H3820, God H0410 hath forgotten H7911 (8804): he hideth H5641 (8689) his face H6440; he will never H5331 see H7200 (8804) [it].
010:012 Arise H6965 (8798), O LORD H3068; O God H0410, lift up H5375 (8798) thine hand H3027: forget H7911 (8799) not the humble H6035 (8675) H6041.
010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked H7563 contemn H5006 (8765) God H0430? he hath said H0559 (8804) in his heart H3820, Thou wilt not require H1875 (8799) [it].
010:014 Thou hast seen H7200 (8804) [it]; for thou beholdest H5027 (8686) mischief H5999 and spite H3708, to requite H5414 (8800) [it] with thy hand H3027: the poor H2489 committeth H5800 (8799) himself unto thee; thou art the helper H5826 (8802) of the fatherless H3490.
010:015 Break H7665 (8798) thou the arm H2220 of the wicked H7563 and the evil H7451 [man]: seek out H1875 (8799) his wickedness H7562 [till] thou find H4672 (8799) none H1077.
010:016 The LORD H3068 [is] King H4428 for ever H5769 and ever H5703: the heathen H1471 are perished H0006 (8804) out of his land H0776.
010:017 LORD H3068, thou hast heard H8085 (8804) the desire H8378 of the humble H6035: thou wilt prepare H3559 (8686) their heart H3820, thou wilt cause thine ear H0241 to hear H7181 (8686):
010:018 To judge H8199 (8800) the fatherless H3490 and the oppressed H1790, that the man H0582 of the earth H0776 may no more H3254 (8686) oppress H6206 (8800).
011:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), [A Psalm] of David H1732.» In the LORD H3068 put I my trust H2620 (8804): how say H0559 (8799) ye to my soul H5315, Flee H5110 (8798) [as] a bird H6833 to your mountain H2022?
011:002 For, lo, the wicked H7563 bend H1869 (8799) [their] bow H7198, they make ready H3559 (8790) their arrow H2671 upon the string H3499, that they may privily H0652 (8676) H1119 shoot H3384 (8800) at the upright H3477 in heart H3820.
011:003 If the foundations H8356 be destroyed H2040 (8735), what can the righteous H6662 do H6466 (8804)?
011:004 The LORD H3068 [is] in his holy H6944 temple H1964, the LORD’S H3068 throne H3678 [is] in heaven H8064: his eyes H5869 behold H2372 (8799), his eyelids H6079 try H0974 (8799), the children H1121 of men H0120.
011:005 The LORD H3068 trieth H0974 (8799) the righteous H6662: but the wicked H7563 and him that loveth H0157 (8802) violence H2555 his soul H5315 hateth H8130 (8804).
011:006 Upon the wicked H7563 he shall rain H4305 (8686) snares H6341, fire H0784 and brimstone H1614, and an horrible H2152 tempest H7307: [this shall be] the portion H4521 of their cup H3563.
011:007 For the righteous H6662 LORD H3068 loveth H0157 (8804) righteousness H6666; his countenance H6440 doth behold H2372 (8799) the upright H3477.
012:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Sheminith H8067, A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Help H3467 (8685), LORD H3068; for the godly man H2623 ceaseth H1584 (8804); for the faithful H0539 (8803) fail H6461 (8804) from among the children H1121 of men H0120.
012:002 They speak H1696 (8762) vanity H7723 every one H0376 with his neighbour H7453: [with] flattering H2513 lips H8193 [and] with a double H3820 heart H3820 do they speak H1696 (8762).
012:003 The LORD H3068 shall cut off H3772 (8686) all flattering H2513 lips H8193, [and] the tongue H3956 that speaketh H1696 (8764) proud H1419 things:
012:004 Who have said H0559 (8804), With our tongue H3956 will we prevail H1396 (8686); our lips H8193 [are] our own: who [is] lord H0113 over us?
012:005 For the oppression H7701 of the poor H6041, for the sighing H0603 of the needy H0034, now will I arise H6965 (8799), saith H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068; I will set H7896 (8799) [him] in safety H3468 [from him that] puffeth H6315 (8686) at him.
012:006 The words H0565 of the LORD H3068 [are] pure H2889 words H0565: [as] silver H3701 tried H6884 (8803) in a furnace H5948 of earth H0776, purified H2212 (8794) seven times H7659.
012:007 Thou shalt keep H8104 (8799) them, O LORD H3068, thou shalt preserve H5341 (8799) them from this H2098 generation H1755 for ever H5769.
012:008 The wicked H7563 walk H1980 (8691) on every side H5439, when the vilest H2149 men H1121 H0120 are exalted H7311 (8800).
013:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» How long wilt thou forget H7911 (8799) me, O LORD H3068? for ever H5331? how long wilt thou hide H5641 (8686) thy face H6440 from me?
013:002 How long shall I take H7896 (8799) counsel H6098 in my soul H5315, [having] sorrow H3015 in my heart H3824 daily H3119? how long shall mine enemy H0341 (8802) be exalted H7311 (8799) over me?
013:003 Consider H5027 (8685) [and] hear H6030 (8798) me, O LORD H3068 my God H0430: lighten H0215 (8685) mine eyes H5869, lest I sleep H3462 (8799) the [sleep of] death H4194;
013:004 Lest mine enemy H0341 (8802) say H0559 (8799), I have prevailed H3201 (8804) against him; [and] those that trouble H6862 me rejoice H1523 (8799) when I am moved H4131 (8735).
013:005 But I have trusted H0982 (8804) in thy mercy H2617; my heart H3820 shall rejoice H1523 (8799) in thy salvation H3444.
013:006 I will sing H7891 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, because he hath dealt bountifully H1580 (8804) with me.
014:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), [A Psalm] of David H1732.» The fool H5036 hath said H0559 (8804) in his heart H3820, [There is] no God H0430. They are corrupt H7843 (8689), they have done abominable H8581 (8689) works H5949, [there is] none that doeth H6213 (8802) good H2896.
014:002 The LORD H3068 looked down H8259 (8689) from heaven H8064 upon the children H1121 of men H0120, to see H7200 (8800) if there H3426 were any that did understand H7919 (8688), [and] seek H1875 (8802) God H0430.
014:003 They are all gone aside H5493 (8804), they are [all] together H3162 become filthy H0444 (8738): [there is] none that doeth H6213 (8802) good H2896, no, not one H0259.
014:004 Have all the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205 no knowledge H3045 (8804)? who eat up H0398 (8802) my people H5971 [as] they eat H0398 (8804) bread H3899, and call H7121 (8804) not upon the LORD H3068.
014:005 There were they in great H6343 fear H6342 (8804): for God H0430 [is] in the generation H1755 of the righteous H6662.
014:006 Ye have shamed H0954 (8686) the counsel H6098 of the poor H6041, because the LORD H3068 [is] his refuge H4268.
014:007 Oh that H5414 (8799) the salvation H3444 of Israel H3478 [were come] out of Zion H6726! when the LORD H3068 bringeth back H7725 (8800) the captivity H7622 of his people H5971, Jacob H3290 shall rejoice H1523 (8799), [and] Israel H3478 shall be glad H8055 (8799).
015:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» LORD H3068, who shall abide H1481 (8799) in thy tabernacle H0168? who shall dwell H7931 (8799) in thy holy H6944 hill H2022?
015:002 He that walketh H1980 (8802) uprightly H8549, and worketh H6466 (8802) righteousness H6664, and speaketh H1696 (8802) the truth H0571 in his heart H3824.
015:003 [He that] backbiteth H7270 (8804) not with his tongue H3956, nor doeth H6213 (8804) evil H7451 to his neighbour H7453, nor taketh up H5375 (8804) a reproach H2781 against his neighbour H7138.
015:004 In whose eyes H5869 a vile person H3988 (8737) is contemned H0959 (8737); but he honoureth H3513 (8762) them that fear H3373 the LORD H3068. [He that] sweareth H7650 (8738) to [his own] hurt H7489 (8687), and changeth H4171 (8686) not.
015:005 [He that] putteth not out H5414 (8804) his money H3701 to usury H5392, nor taketh H3947 (8804) reward H7810 against the innocent H5355. He that doeth H6213 (8802) these [things] shall never H5769 be moved H4131 (8735).
016:001 ¶  «Michtam H4387 of David H1732.» Preserve H8104 (8798) me, O God H0410: for in thee do I put my trust H2620 (8804).
016:002 [O my soul], thou hast said H0559 (8804) unto the LORD H3068, Thou [art] my Lord H0136: my goodness H2896 [extendeth] not to thee;
016:003 [But] to the saints H6918 that H1992 [are] in the earth H0776, and [to] the excellent H0117, in whom [is] all my delight H2656.
016:004 Their sorrows H6094 shall be multiplied H7235 (8799) [that] hasten H4116 (8804) [after] another H0312 [god]: their drink offerings H5262 of blood H1818 will I not offer H5258 (8686), nor H1077 take up H5375 (8799) their names H8034 into my lips H8193.
016:005 The LORD H3068 [is] the portion H4490 of mine inheritance H2506 and of my cup H3563: thou maintainest H8551 (8802) my lot H1486.
016:006 The lines H2256 are fallen H5307 (8804) unto me in pleasant H5273 [places]; yea, I have a goodly H8231 (8804) heritage H5159.
016:007 I will bless H1288 (8762) the LORD H3068, who hath given me counsel H3289 (8804): my reins H3629 also instruct H3256 (8765) me in the night seasons H3915.
016:008 I have set H7737 (8765) the LORD H3068 always H8548 before me: because [he is] at my right hand H3225, I shall not be moved H4131 (8735).
016:009 Therefore my heart H3820 is glad H8055 (8804), and my glory H3519 rejoiceth H1523 (8799): my flesh H1320 also shall rest H7931 (8799) in hope H0983.
016:010 For thou wilt not leave H5800 (8799) my soul H5315 in hell H7585; neither wilt thou suffer H5414 (8799) thine Holy One H2623 to see H7200 (8800) corruption H7845.
016:011 Thou wilt shew H3045 (8686) me the path H0734 of life H2416: in thy presence H6440 [is] fulness H7648 of joy H8057; at thy right hand H3225 [there are] pleasures H5273 for evermore H5331.
017:001 ¶  «A Prayer H8605 of David H1732.» Hear H8085 (8798) the right H6664, O LORD H3068, attend H7181 (8685) unto my cry H7440, give ear H0238 (8685) unto my prayer H8605, [that goeth] not H3808 out of feigned H4820 lips H8193.
017:002 Let my sentence H4941 come forth H3318 (8799) from thy presence H6440; let thine eyes H5869 behold H2372 (8799) the things that are equal H4339.
017:003 Thou hast proved H0974 (8804) mine heart H3820; thou hast visited H6485 (8804) [me] in the night H3915; thou hast tried H6884 (8804) me, [and] shalt find H4672 (8799) nothing; I am purposed H2161 (8800) [that] my mouth H6310 shall not transgress H5674 (8799).
017:004 Concerning the works H6468 of men H0120, by the word H1697 of thy lips H8193 I have kept H8104 (8804) [me from] the paths H0734 of the destroyer H6530.
017:005 Hold up H8551 (8800) my goings H0838 in thy paths H4570, [that] my footsteps H6471 slip H4131 (8738) not.
017:006 I have called H7121 (8804) upon thee, for thou wilt hear H6030 (8799) me, O God H0410: incline H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241 unto me, [and hear H8085 (8798) ] my speech H0565.
017:007 Shew thy marvellous H6395 (8685) lovingkindness H2617, O thou that savest H3467 (8688) by thy right hand H3225 them which put their trust H2620 (8802) [in thee] from those that rise up H6965 (8693) [against them].
017:008 Keep H8104 (8798) me as the apple H0380 of the eye H1323 H5869, hide H5641 (8686) me under the shadow H6738 of thy wings H3671,
017:009 From H6440 the wicked H7563 that H2098 oppress H7703 (8804) me, [from] my deadly H5315 enemies H0341 (8802), [who] compass me about H5362 (8686).
017:010 They are inclosed H5462 (8804) in their own fat H2459: with their mouth H6310 they speak H1696 (8765) proudly H1348.
017:011 They have now compassed H5437 (8804) us in our steps H0838: they have set H7896 (8799) their eyes H5869 bowing down H5186 (8800) to the earth H0776;
017:012 Like H1825 as a lion H0738 [that] is greedy H3700 (8799) of his prey H2963 (8800), and as it were a young lion H3715 lurking H3427 (8802) in secret places H4565.
017:013 Arise H6965 (8798), O LORD H3068, disappoint H6923 (8761) him H6440, cast him down H3766 (8685): deliver H6403 (8761) my soul H5315 from the wicked H7563, [which is] thy sword H2719:
017:014 From men H4962 [which are] thy hand H3027, O LORD H3068, from men H4962 of the world H2465, [which have] their portion H2506 in [this] life H2416, and whose belly H0990 thou fillest H4390 (8762) with thy hid H6840 [treasure]: they are full H7646 (8799) of children H1121, and leave H3240 (8689) the rest H3499 of their [substance] to their babes H5768.
017:015 As for me, I will behold H2372 (8799) thy face H6440 in righteousness H6664: I shall be satisfied H7646 (8799), when I awake H6974 (8687), with thy likeness H8544.
018:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), [A Psalm] of David H1732, the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068, who spake H1696 (8765) unto the LORD H3068 the words H1697 of this song H7892 in the day H3117 [that] the LORD H3068 delivered H5337 (8689) him from the hand H3709 of all his enemies H0341 (8802), and from the hand H3027 of Saul H7586: And he said H0559 (8799),» I will love H7355 (8799) thee, O LORD H3068, my strength H2391.
018:002 The LORD H3068 [is] my rock H5553, and my fortress H4686, and my deliverer H6403 (8764); my God H0410, my strength H6697, in whom I will trust H2620 (8799); my buckler H4043, and the horn H7161 of my salvation H3468, [and] my high tower H4869.
018:003 I will call H7121 (8799) upon the LORD H3068, [who is worthy] to be praised H1984 (8794): so shall I be saved H3467 (8735) from mine enemies H0341 (8802).
018:004 The sorrows H2256 of death H4194 compassed H0661 (8804) me, and the floods H5158 of ungodly men H1100 made me afraid H1204 (8762).
018:005 The sorrows H2256 of hell H7585 compassed me about H5437 (8804): the snares H4170 of death H4194 prevented H6923 (8765) me.
018:006 In my distress H6862 I called H7121 (8799) upon the LORD H3068, and cried H7768 (8762) unto my God H0430: he heard H8085 (8799) my voice H6963 out of his temple H1964, and my cry H7775 came H0935 (8799) before H6440 him, [even] into his ears H0241.
018:007 Then the earth H0776 shook H1607 (8799) and trembled H7493 (8799); the foundations H4146 also of the hills H2022 moved H7264 (8799) and were shaken H1607 (8691), because he was wroth H2734 (8804).
018:008 There went up H5927 (8804) a smoke H6227 out of his nostrils H0639, and fire H0784 out of his mouth H6310 devoured H0398 (8799): coals H1513 were kindled H1197 (8804) by it.
018:009 He bowed H5186 (8799) the heavens H8064 also, and came down H3381 (8799): and darkness H6205 [was] under his feet H7272.
018:010 And he rode H7392 (8799) upon a cherub H3742, and did fly H5774 (8799): yea, he did fly H1675 (8799) upon the wings H3671 of the wind H7307.
018:011 He made H7896 (8799) darkness H2822 his secret place H5643; his pavilion H5521 round about H5439 him [were] dark H2824 waters H4325 [and] thick clouds H5645 of the skies H7834.
018:012 At the brightness H5051 [that was] before him his thick clouds H5645 passed H5674 (8804), hail H1259 [stones] and coals H1513 of fire H0784.
018:013 The LORD H3068 also thundered H7481 (8686) in the heavens H8064, and the Highest H5945 gave H5414 (8799) his voice H6963; hail H1259 [stones] and coals H1513 of fire H0784.
018:014 Yea, he sent out H7971 (8799) his arrows H2671, and scattered H6327 (8686) them; and he shot out H7232 (8804) lightnings H1300, and discomfited H2000 (8799) them.
018:015 Then the channels H0650 of waters H4325 were seen H7200 (8735), and the foundations H4146 of the world H8398 were discovered H1540 (8735) at thy rebuke H1606, O LORD H3068, at the blast H5397 of the breath H7307 of thy nostrils H0639.
018:016 He sent H7971 (8799) from above H4791, he took H3947 (8799) me, he drew H4871 (8686) me out of many H7227 waters H4325.
018:017 He delivered H5337 (8686) me from my strong H5794 enemy H0341 (8802), and from them which hated H8130 (8802) me: for they were too strong H0553 (8804) for me.
018:018 They prevented H6923 (8762) me in the day H3117 of my calamity H0343: but the LORD H3068 was my stay H4937.
018:019 He brought me forth H3318 (8686) also into a large place H4800; he delivered H2502 (8762) me, because he delighted H2654 (8804) in me.
018:020 The LORD H3068 rewarded H1580 (8799) me according to my righteousness H6664; according to the cleanness H1252 of my hands H3027 hath he recompensed H7725 (8686) me.
018:021 For I have kept H8104 (8804) the ways H1870 of the LORD H3068, and have not wickedly departed H7561 (8804) from my God H0430.
018:022 For all his judgments H4941 [were] before me, and I did not put away H5493 (8686) his statutes H2708 from me.
018:023 I was also upright H8549 before him, and I kept H8104 (8691) myself from mine iniquity H5771.
018:024 Therefore hath the LORD H3068 recompensed H7725 (8686) me according to my righteousness H6664, according to the cleanness H1252 of my hands H3027 in his eyesight H5869.
018:025 With the merciful H2623 thou wilt shew thyself merciful H2616 (8691); with an upright H8549 man H1399 thou wilt shew thyself upright H8552 (8691);
018:026 With the pure H1305 (8737) thou wilt shew thyself pure H1305 (8691); and with the froward H6141 thou wilt shew thyself froward H6617 (8691).
018:027 For thou wilt save H3467 (8686) the afflicted H6041 people H5971; but wilt bring down H8213 (8686) high H7311 (8802) looks H5869.
018:028 For thou wilt light H0215 (8686) my candle H5216: the LORD H3068 my God H0430 will enlighten H5050 (8686) my darkness H2822.
018:029 For by thee I have run through H7323 (8799) a troop H1416; and by my God H0430 have I leaped over H1801 (8762) a wall H7791.
018:030 [As for] God H0410, his way H1870 [is] perfect H8549: the word H0565 of the LORD H3068 is tried H6884 (8803): he [is] a buckler H4043 to all those that trust H2620 (8802) in him.
018:031 For who [is] God H0433 save H1107 the LORD H3068? or who [is] a rock H6697 save H2108 our God H0430?
018:032 [It is] God H0410 that girdeth H0247 (8764) me with strength H2428, and maketh H5414 (8799) my way H1870 perfect H8549.
018:033 He maketh H7737 (8764) my feet H7272 like hinds H0355 ’ [feet], and setteth H5975 (8686) me upon my high places H1116.
018:034 He teacheth H3925 (8764) my hands H3027 to war H4421, so that a bow H7198 of steel H5154 is broken H5181 (8765) by mine arms H2220.
018:035 Thou hast also given H5414 (8799) me the shield H4043 of thy salvation H3468: and thy right hand H3225 hath holden me up H5582 (8799), and thy gentleness H6037 hath made me great H7235 (8686).
018:036 Thou hast enlarged H7337 (8686) my steps H6806 under me, that my feet H7166 did not slip H4571 (8804).
018:037 I have pursued H7291 (8799) mine enemies H0341 (8802), and overtaken H5381 (8686) them: neither did I turn again H7725 (8799) till they were consumed H3615 (8763).
018:038 I have wounded H4272 (8799) them that they were not able H3201 (8799) to rise H6965 (8800): they are fallen H5307 (8799) under my feet H7272.
018:039 For thou hast girded H0247 (8762) me with strength H2428 unto the battle H4421: thou hast subdued H3766 (8686) under me those that rose up H6965 (8801) against me.
018:040 Thou hast also given H5414 (8804) me the necks H6203 of mine enemies H0341 (8802); that I might destroy H6789 (8686) them that hate H8130 (8764) me.
018:041 They cried H7768 (8762), but [there was] none to save H3467 (8688) [them: even] unto the LORD H3068, but he answered H6030 (8804) them not.
018:042 Then did I beat H7833 (8799) them small as the dust H6083 before H6440 the wind H7307: I did cast them out H7324 (8686) as the dirt H2916 in the streets H2351.
018:043 Thou hast delivered H6403 (8762) me from the strivings H7379 of the people H5971; [and] thou hast made H7760 (8799) me the head H7218 of the heathen H1471: a people H5971 [whom] I have not known H3045 (8804) shall serve H5647 (8799) me.
018:044 As soon as they hear H8088 H0241 of me, they shall obey H8085 (8735) me: the strangers H1121 H5236 shall submit H3584 (8762) themselves unto me.
018:045 The strangers H1121 H5236 shall fade away H5034 (8799), and be afraid H2727 (8799) out of their close places H4526.
018:046 The LORD H3068 liveth H2416; and blessed H1288 (8803) [be] my rock H6697; and let the God H0430 of my salvation H3468 be exalted H7311 (8799).
018:047 [It is] God H0410 that avengeth H5414 (8802) H5360 me, and subdueth H1696 (8686) the people H5971 under me.
018:048 He delivereth H6403 (8764) me from mine enemies H0341 (8802): yea, thou liftest me up H7311 (8787) above those that rise up H6965 (8801) against me: thou hast delivered H5337 (8686) me from the violent H2555 man H0376.
018:049 Therefore will I give thanks H3034 (8686) unto thee, O LORD H3068, among the heathen H1471, and sing praises H2167 (8762) unto thy name H8034.
018:050 Great H1431 (8688) deliverance H3444 giveth he to his king H4428; and sheweth H6213 (8802) mercy H2617 to his anointed H4899, to David H1732, and to his seed H2233 for H5704 evermore H5769.
019:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» The heavens H8064 declare H5608 (8764) the glory H3519 of God H0410; and the firmament H7549 sheweth his H5046 (8688) handywork H4639 H3027.
019:002 Day H3117 unto day H3117 uttereth H5042 (8686) speech H0562, and night H3915 unto night H3915 sheweth H2331 (8762) knowledge H1847.
019:003 [There is] no speech H0562 nor language H1697, [where] their voice H6963 is not heard H8085 (8738).
019:004 Their line H6957 is gone out H3318 (8804) through all the earth H0776, and their words H4405 to the end H7097 of the world H8398. In them hath he set H7760 (8804) a tabernacle H0168 for the sun H8121,
019:005 Which [is] as a bridegroom H2860 coming out H3318 (8802) of his chamber H2646, [and] rejoiceth H7797 (8799) as a strong man H1368 to run H7323 (8800) a race H0734.
019:006 His going forth H4161 [is] from the end H7097 of the heaven H8064, and his circuit H8622 unto the ends H7098 of it: and there is nothing hid H5641 (8737) from the heat H2535 thereof.
019:007 The law H8451 of the LORD H3068 [is] perfect H8549, converting H7725 (8688) the soul H5315: the testimony H5715 of the LORD H3068 [is] sure H0539 (8737), making wise H2449 (8688) the simple H6612.
019:008 The statutes H6490 of the LORD H3068 [are] right H3477, rejoicing H8055 (8764) the heart H3820: the commandment H4687 of the LORD H3068 [is] pure H1249, enlightening H0215 (8688) the eyes H5869.
019:009 The fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [is] clean H2889, enduring H5975 (8802) for ever H5703: the judgments H4941 of the LORD H3068 [are] true H0571 [and] righteous H6663 (8804) altogether H3162.
019:010 More to be desired H2530 (8737) [are they] than gold H2091, yea, than much H7227 fine gold H6337: sweeter H4966 also than honey H1706 and the honeycomb H5317 H6688.
019:011 Moreover by them is thy servant H5650 warned H2094 (8737): [and] in keeping H8104 (8800) of them [there is] great H7227 reward H6118.
019:012 Who can understand H0995 (8799) [his] errors H7691? cleanse H5352 (8761) thou me from secret H5641 (8737) [faults].
019:013 Keep back H2820 (8798) thy servant H5650 also from presumptuous H2086 [sins]; let them not have dominion H4910 (8799) over me: then shall I be upright H8552 (8799), and I shall be innocent H5352 (8738) from the great H7227 transgression H6588.
019:014 Let the words H0561 of my mouth H6310, and the meditation H1902 of my heart H3820, be acceptable H7522 in thy sight H6440, O LORD H3068, my strength H6697, and my redeemer H1350 (8802).
020:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» The LORD H3068 hear H6030 (8799) thee in the day H3117 of trouble H6869; the name H8034 of the God H0430 of Jacob H3290 defend H7682 (8762) thee;
020:002 Send H7971 (8799) thee help H5828 from the sanctuary H6944, and strengthen H5582 (8799) thee out of Zion H6726;
020:003 Remember H2142 (8799) all thy offerings H4503, and accept H1878 (8762) thy burnt sacrifice H5930; Selah H5542.
020:004 Grant H5414 (8799) thee according to thine own heart H3824, and fulfil H4390 (8762) all thy counsel H6098.
020:005 We will rejoice H7442 (8762) in thy salvation H3444, and in the name H8034 of our God H0430 we will set up [our] banners H1713 (8799): the LORD H3068 fulfil H4390 (8762) all thy petitions H4862.
020:006 Now know H3045 (8804) I that the LORD H3068 saveth H3467 (8689) his anointed H4899; he will hear H6030 (8799) him from his holy H6944 heaven H8064 with the saving H3468 strength H1369 of his right hand H3225.
020:007 Some [trust] in chariots H7393, and some in horses H5483: but we will remember H2142 (8686) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430.
020:008 They are brought down H3766 (8804) and fallen H5307 (8804): but we are risen H6965 (8804), and stand upright H5749 (8696).
020:009 Save H3467 (8685), LORD H3068: let the king H4428 hear H6030 (8799) us when H3117 we call H7121 (8800).
021:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» The king H4428 shall joy H8055 (8799) in thy strength H5797, O LORD H3068; and in thy salvation H3444 how greatly H3966 shall he rejoice H1523 (8799)!
021:002 Thou hast given H5414 (8804) him his heart’s H3820 desire H8378, and hast not withholden H4513 (8804) the request H0782 of his lips H8193. Selah H5542.
021:003 For thou preventest H6923 (8762) him with the blessings H1293 of goodness H2896: thou settest H7896 (8799) a crown H5850 of pure gold H6337 on his head H7218.
021:004 He asked H7592 (8804) life H2416 of thee, [and] thou gavest H5414 (8804) [it] him, [even] length H0753 of days H3117 for ever H5769 and ever H5703.
021:005 His glory H3519 [is] great H1419 in thy salvation H3444: honour H1935 and majesty H1926 hast thou laid H7737 (8762) upon him.
021:006 For thou hast made H7896 (8799) him most blessed H1293 for ever H5703: thou hast made H2302 (8762) him exceeding glad H8057 with thy countenance H6440.
021:007 For the king H4428 trusteth H0982 (8802) in the LORD H3068, and through the mercy H2617 of the most High H5945 he shall not be moved H4131 (8735).
021:008 Thine hand H3027 shall find out H4672 (8799) all thine enemies H0341 (8802): thy right hand H3225 shall find out H4672 (8799) those that hate H8130 (8802) thee.
021:009 Thou shalt make H7896 (8799) them as a fiery H0784 oven H8574 in the time H6256 of thine anger H6440: the LORD H3068 shall swallow them up H1104 (8762) in his wrath H0639, and the fire H0784 shall devour H0398 (8799) them.
021:010 Their fruit H6529 shalt thou destroy H0006 (8762) from the earth H0776, and their seed H2233 from among the children H1121 of men H0120.
021:011 For they intended H5186 (8804) evil H7451 against thee: they imagined H2803 (8804) a mischievous device H4209, [which] they are not able H3201 (8799) [to perform].
021:012 Therefore shalt thou make H7896 (8799) them turn their back H7926, [when] thou shalt make ready H3559 (8787) [thine arrows] upon thy strings H4340 against the face H6440 of them.
021:013 Be thou exalted H7311 (8798), LORD H3068, in thine own strength H5797: [so] will we sing H7891 (8799) and praise H2167 (8762) thy power H1369.
022:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Aijeleth H0365 Shahar H7837, A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» My God H0410, my God H0410, why hast thou forsaken H5800 (8804) me? [why art thou so] far H7350 from helping H3444 me, [and from] the words H1697 of my roaring H7581?
022:002 O my God H0430, I cry H7121 (8799) in the daytime H3119, but thou hearest H6030 (8799) not; and in the night season H3915, and am not silent H1747.
022:003 But thou [art] holy H6918, [O thou] that inhabitest H3427 (8802) the praises H8416 of Israel H3478.
022:004 Our fathers H0001 trusted H0982 (8804) in thee: they trusted H0982 (8804), and thou didst deliver H6403 (8762) them.
022:005 They cried H2199 (8804) unto thee, and were delivered H4422 (8738): they trusted H0982 (8804) in thee, and were not confounded H0954 (8804).
022:006 But I [am] a worm H8438, and no man H0376; a reproach H2781 of men H0120, and despised H0959 (8803) of the people H5971.
022:007 All they that see H7200 (8802) me laugh me to scorn H3932 (8686): they shoot out H6358 (8686) the lip H8193, they shake H5128 (8686) the head H7218, [saying],
022:008 He trusted H1556 (8800) on the LORD H3068 [that] he would deliver H6403 (8762) him: let him deliver H5337 (8686) him, seeing he delighted H2654 (8804) in him.
022:009 But thou [art] he that took H1518 (8801) me out of the womb H0990: thou didst make me hope H0982 (8688) [when I was] upon my mother’s H0517 breasts H7699.
022:010 I was cast H7993 (8717) upon thee from the womb H7358: thou [art] my God H0410 from my mother’s H0517 belly H0990.
022:011 Be not far H7368 (8799) from me; for trouble H6869 [is] near H7138; for [there is] none to help H5826 (8802).
022:012 Many H7227 bulls H6499 have compassed H5437 (8804) me: strong H0047 [bulls] of Bashan H1316 have beset me round H3803 (8765).
022:013 They gaped H6475 (8804) upon me [with] their mouths H6310, [as] a ravening H2963 (8802) and a roaring H7580 (8802) lion H0738.
022:014 I am poured out H8210 (8738) like water H4325, and all my bones H6106 are out of joint H6504 (8694): my heart H3820 is like wax H1749; it is melted H4549 (8738) in the midst H8432 of my bowels H4578.
022:015 My strength H3581 is dried up H3001 (8804) like a potsherd H2789; and my tongue H3956 cleaveth H1692 (8716) to my jaws H4455; and thou hast brought H8239 (8799) me into the dust H6083 of death H4194.
022:016 For dogs H3611 have compassed H5437 (8804) me: the assembly H5712 of the wicked H7489 (8688) have inclosed H5362 (8689) me: they pierced H3738 (8804) (8675) H0738 my hands H3027 and my feet H7272.
022:017 I may tell H5608 (8762) all my bones H6106: they look H5027 (8686) [and] stare H7200 (8799) upon me.
022:018 They part H2505 (8762) my garments H0899 among them, and cast H5307 (8686) lots H1486 upon my vesture H3830.
022:019 But be not thou far H7368 (8799) from me, O LORD H3068: O my strength H0360, haste H2363 (8798) thee to help H5833 me.
022:020 Deliver H5337 (8685) my soul H5315 from the sword H2719; my darling H3173 from the power H3027 of the dog H3611.
022:021 Save H3467 (8685) me from the lion’s H0738 mouth H6310: for thou hast heard H6030 (8804) me from the horns H7161 of the unicorns H7214.
022:022 I will declare H5608 (8762) thy name H8034 unto my brethren H0251: in the midst H8432 of the congregation H6951 will I praise H1984 (8762) thee.
022:023 Ye that fear H3373 the LORD H3068, praise H1984 (8761) him; all ye the seed H2233 of Jacob H3290, glorify H3513 (8761) him; and fear H1481 (8798) him, all ye the seed H2233 of Israel H3478.
022:024 For he hath not despised H0959 (8804) nor abhorred H8262 (8765) the affliction H6039 of the afflicted H6041; neither hath he hid H5641 (8689) his face H6440 from him; but when he cried H7768 (8763) unto him, he heard H8085 (8804).
022:025 My praise H8416 [shall be] of thee in the great H7227 congregation H6951: I will pay H7999 (8762) my vows H5088 before them that fear H3373 him.
022:026 The meek H6035 shall eat H0398 (8799) and be satisfied H7646 (8799): they shall praise H1984 (8762) the LORD H3068 that seek H1875 (8802) him: your heart H3824 shall live H2421 (8799) for ever H5703.
022:027 All the ends H0657 of the world H0776 shall remember H2142 (8799) and turn H7725 (8799) unto the LORD H3068: and all the kindreds H4940 of the nations H1471 shall worship H7812 (8691) before H6440 thee.
022:028 For the kingdom H4410 [is] the LORD’S H3068: and he [is] the governor H4910 (8802) among the nations H1471.
022:029 All [they that be] fat H1879 upon earth H0776 shall eat H0398 (8804) and worship H7812 (8691): all they that go down H3381 (8802) to the dust H6083 shall bow H3766 (8799) before H6440 him: and none can keep alive H2421 (8765) his own soul H5315.
022:030 A seed H2233 shall serve H5647 (8799) him; it shall be accounted H5608 (8792) to the Lord H0136 for a generation H1755.
022:031 They shall come H0935 (8799), and shall declare H5046 (8686) his righteousness H6666 unto a people H5971 that shall be born H3205 (8737), that he hath done H6213 (8804) [this].
023:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» The LORD H3068 [is] my shepherd H7462 (8802); I shall not want H2637 (8799).
023:002 He maketh me to lie down H7257 (8686) in green H1877 pastures H4999: he leadeth H5095 (8762) me beside the still H4496 waters H4325.
023:003 He restoreth H7725 (8787) my soul H5315: he leadeth H5148 (8686) me in the paths H4570 of righteousness H6664 for his name’s H8034 sake.
023:004 Yea, though I walk H3212 (8799) through the valley H1516 of the shadow of death H6757, I will fear H3372 (8799) no evil H7451: for thou [art] with me; thy rod H7626 and thy staff H4938 they comfort H5162 (8762) me.
023:005 Thou preparest H6186 (8799) a table H7979 before H6440 me in the presence of mine enemies H6887 (8802): thou anointest H1878 (8765) my head H7218 with oil H8081; my cup H3563 runneth over H7310.
023:006 Surely goodness H2896 and mercy H2617 shall follow H7291 (8799) me all the days H3117 of my life H2416: and I will dwell H3427 (8804) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 for ever H0753 H3117.
024:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» The earth H0776 [is] the LORD’S H3068, and the fulness H4393 thereof; the world H8398, and they that dwell H3427 (8802) therein.
024:002 For he hath founded H3245 (8804) it upon the seas H3220, and established H3559 (8787) it upon the floods H5104.
024:003 Who shall ascend H5927 (8799) into the hill H2022 of the LORD H3068? or who shall stand H6965 (8799) in his holy H6944 place H4725?
024:004 He that hath clean H5355 hands H3709, and a pure H1249 heart H3824; who hath not lifted up H5375 (8804) his soul H5315 unto vanity H7723, nor sworn H7650 (8738) deceitfully H4820.
024:005 He shall receive H5375 (8799) the blessing H1293 from the LORD H3068, and righteousness H6666 from the God H0430 of his salvation H3468.
024:006 This [is] the generation H1755 of them that seek H1875 (8802) him, that seek H1245 (8764) thy face H6440, O Jacob H3290. Selah H5542.
024:007 Lift up H5375 (8798) your heads H7218, O ye gates H8179; and be ye lift up H5375 (8734), ye everlasting H5769 doors H6607; and the King H4428 of glory H3519 shall come in H0935 (8799).
024:008 Who [is] this King H4428 of glory H3519? The LORD H3068 strong H5808 and mighty H1368, the LORD H3068 mighty H1368 in battle H4421.
024:009 Lift up H5375 (8798) your heads H7218, O ye gates H8179; even lift [them] up H5375 (8798), ye everlasting H5769 doors H6607; and the King H4428 of glory H3519 shall come in H0935 (8799).
024:010 Who is this King H4428 of glory H3519? The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, he [is] the King H4428 of glory H3519. Selah H5542.
025:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732.» Unto thee, O LORD H3068, do I lift up H5375 (8799) my soul H5315.
025:002 O my God H0430, I trust H0982 (8804) in thee: let me not be ashamed H0954 (8799), let not mine enemies H0341 (8802) triumph H5970 (8799) over me.
025:003 Yea, let none that wait H6960 (8802) on thee be ashamed H0954 (8799): let them be ashamed H0954 (8799) which transgress H0898 (8802) without cause H7387.
025:004 Shew H3045 (8685) me thy ways H1870, O LORD H3068; teach H3925 (8761) me thy paths H0734.
025:005 Lead H1869 (8685) me in thy truth H0571, and teach H3925 (8761) me: for thou [art] the God H0430 of my salvation H3468; on thee do I wait H6960 (8765) all the day H3117.
025:006 Remember H2142 (8798), O LORD H3068, thy tender mercies H7356 and thy lovingkindnesses H2617; for they [have been] ever of old H5769.
025:007 Remember H2142 (8799) not the sins H2403 of my youth H5271, nor my transgressions H6588: according to thy mercy H2617 remember H2142 (8798) thou me for thy goodness H2898 ’ sake, O LORD H3068.
025:008 Good H2896 and upright H3477 [is] the LORD H3068: therefore will he teach H3384 (8686) sinners H2400 in the way H1870.
025:009 The meek H6035 will he guide H1869 (8686) in judgment H4941: and the meek H6035 will he teach H3925 (8762) his way H1870.
025:010 All the paths H0734 of the LORD H3068 [are] mercy H2617 and truth H0571 unto such as keep H5341 (8802) his covenant H1285 and his testimonies H5713.
025:011 For thy name’s H8034 sake, O LORD H3068, pardon H5545 (8804) mine iniquity H5771; for it [is] great H7227.
025:012 What man H0376 [is] he that feareth H3373 the LORD H3068? him shall he teach H3384 (8686) in the way H1870 [that] he shall choose H0977 (8799).
025:013 His soul H5315 shall dwell H3885 (8799) at ease H2896; and his seed H2233 shall inherit H3423 (8799) the earth H0776.
025:014 The secret H5475 of the LORD H3068 [is] with them that fear H3373 him; and he will shew H3045 (8687) them his covenant H1285.
025:015 Mine eyes H5869 [are] ever H8548 toward the LORD H3068; for he shall pluck H3318 (8686) my feet H7272 out of the net H7568.
025:016 Turn H6437 (8798) thee unto me, and have mercy H2603 (8798) upon me; for I [am] desolate H3173 and afflicted H6041.
025:017 The troubles H6869 of my heart H3824 are enlarged H7337 (8689): [O] bring thou me out H3318 (8685) of my distresses H4691.
025:018 Look H7200 (8798) upon mine affliction H6040 and my pain H5999; and forgive H5375 (8798) all my sins H2403.
025:019 Consider H7200 (8798) mine enemies H0341 (8802); for they are many H7231 (8804); and they hate H8130 (8804) me with cruel H2555 hatred H8135.
025:020 O keep H8104 (8798) my soul H5315, and deliver H5337 (8685) me: let me not be ashamed H0954 (8799); for I put my trust H2620 (8804) in thee.
025:021 Let integrity H8537 and uprightness H3476 preserve H5341 (8799) me; for I wait H6960 (8765) on thee.
025:022 Redeem H6299 (8798) Israel H3478, O God H0430, out of all his troubles H6869.
026:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732.» Judge H8199 (8798) me, O LORD H3068; for I have walked H1980 (8804) in mine integrity H8537: I have trusted H0982 (8804) also in the LORD H3068; [therefore] I shall not slide H4571 (8799).
026:002 Examine H0974 (8798) me, O LORD H3068, and prove H5254 (8761) me; try H6884 (8798) my reins H3629 and my heart H3820.
026:003 For thy lovingkindness H2617 [is] before mine eyes H5869: and I have walked H1980 (8694) in thy truth H0571.
026:004 I have not sat H3427 (8804) with vain H7723 persons H4962, neither will I go in H0935 (8799) with dissemblers H5956 (8737).
026:005 I have hated H8130 (8804) the congregation H6951 of evil doers H7489 (8688); and will not sit H3427 (8799) with the wicked H7563.
026:006 I will wash H7364 (8799) mine hands H3709 in innocency H5356: so will I compass H5437 (8779) thine altar H4196, O LORD H3068:
026:007 That I may publish H8085 (8687) with the voice H6963 of thanksgiving H8426, and tell H5608 (8763) of all thy wondrous works H6381 (8737).
026:008 LORD H3068, I have loved H0157 (8804) the habitation H4583 of thy house H1004, and the place H4725 where thine honour H3519 dwelleth H4908.
026:009 Gather H0622 (8799) not my soul H5315 with sinners H2400, nor my life H2416 with bloody H1818 men H0582:
026:010 In whose hands H3027 [is] mischief H2154, and their right hand H3225 is full H4390 (8804) of bribes H7810.
026:011 But as for me, I will walk H3212 (8799) in mine integrity H8537: redeem H6299 (8798) me, and be merciful H2603 (8798) unto me.
026:012 My foot H7272 standeth H5975 (8804) in an even place H4334: in the congregations H4721 will I bless H1288 (8762) the LORD H3068.
027:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732.» The LORD H3068 [is] my light H0216 and my salvation H3468; whom shall I fear H3372 (8799)? the LORD H3068 [is] the strength H4581 of my life H2416; of whom shall I be afraid H6342 (8799)?
027:002 When the wicked H7489 (8688), [even] mine enemies H6862 and my foes H0341 (8802), came H7126 (8800) upon me to eat up H0398 (8800) my flesh H1320, they stumbled H3782 (8804) and fell H5307 (8804).
027:003 Though an host H4264 should encamp H2583 (8799) against me, my heart H3820 shall not fear H3372 (8799): though war H4421 should rise H6965 (8799) against me, in this [will] I [be] confident H0982 (8802).
027:004 One H0259 [thing] have I desired H7592 (8804) of the LORD H3068, that will I seek H1245 (8762) after; that I may dwell H3427 (8800) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 all the days H3117 of my life H2416, to behold H2372 (8800) the beauty H5278 of the LORD H3068, and to enquire H1239 (8763) in his temple H1964.
027:005 For in the time H3117 of trouble H7451 he shall hide H6845 (8799) me in his pavilion H5520: in the secret H5643 of his tabernacle H0168 shall he hide H5641 (8686) me; he shall set me up H7311 (8787) upon a rock H6697.
027:006 And now shall mine head H7218 be lifted up H7311 (8799) above mine enemies H0341 (8802) round about H5439 me: therefore will I offer H2076 (8799) in his tabernacle H0168 sacrifices H2077 of joy H8643; I will sing H7891 (8799), yea, I will sing praises H2167 (8762) unto the LORD H3068.
027:007 Hear H8085 (8798), O LORD H3068, [when] I cry H7121 (8799) with my voice H6963: have mercy H2603 (8798) also upon me, and answer H6030 (8798) me.
027:008 [When thou saidst], Seek H1245 (8761) ye my face H6440; my heart H3820 said H0559 (8804) unto thee, Thy face H6440, LORD H3068, will I seek H1245 (8762).
027:009 Hide H5641 (8686) not thy face H6440 [far] from me; put H5186 not thy servant H5650 away H5186 (8686) in anger H0639: thou hast been my help H5833; leave H5203 (8799) me not, neither forsake H5800 (8799) me, O God H0430 of my salvation H3468.
027:010 When my father H0001 and my mother H0517 forsake H5800 (8804) me, then the LORD H3068 will take me up H0622 (8799).
027:011 Teach H3384 (8685) me thy way H1870, O LORD H3068, and lead H5148 (8798) me in a plain H4334 path H0734, because of mine enemies H8324 (8802).
027:012 Deliver H5414 (8799) me not over unto the will H5315 of mine enemies H6862: for false H8267 witnesses H5707 are risen up H6965 (8804) against me, and such as breathe out H3307 cruelty H2555.
027:013 [I had fainted], unless H3884 I had believed H0539 (8689) to see H7200 (8800) the goodness H2898 of the LORD H3068 in the land H0776 of the living H2416.
027:014 Wait H6960 (8761) on the LORD H3068: be of good courage H2388 (8798), and he shall strengthen H0553 (8686) thine heart H3820: wait H6960 (8761), I say, on the LORD H3068.
028:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732.» Unto thee will I cry H7121 (8799), O LORD H3068 my rock H6697; be not silent H2814 (8799) to me: lest, [if] thou be silent H2790 (8799) to me, I become H4911 (8738) like them that go down H3381 (8802) into the pit H0953.
028:002 Hear H8085 (8798) the voice H6963 of my supplications H8469, when I cry H7768 (8763) unto thee, when I lift up H5375 (8800) my hands H3027 toward thy holy H6944 oracle H1687.
028:003 Draw me not away H4900 (8799) with the wicked H7563, and with the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205, which speak H1696 (8802) peace H7965 to their neighbours H7453, but mischief H7451 [is] in their hearts H3824.
028:004 Give H5414 (8798) them according to their deeds H6467, and according to the wickedness H7455 of their endeavours H4611: give H5414 (8798) them after the work H4639 of their hands H3027; render H7725 (8685) to them their desert H1576.
028:005 Because they regard H0995 (8799) not the works H6468 of the LORD H3068, nor the operation H4639 of his hands H3027, he shall destroy H2040 (8799) them, and not build them up H1129 (8799).
028:006 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068, because he hath heard H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of my supplications H8469.
028:007 The LORD H3068 [is] my strength H5797 and my shield H4043; my heart H3820 trusted H0982 (8804) in him, and I am helped H5826 (8738): therefore my heart H3820 greatly rejoiceth H5937 (8799); and with my song H7892 will I praise H3034 (8686) him.
028:008 The LORD H3068 [is] their strength H5797, and he [is] the saving H3444 strength H4581 of his anointed H4899.
028:009 Save H3467 (8685) thy people H5971, and bless H1288 (8761) thine inheritance H5159: feed H7462 (8798) them also, and lift them up H5375 (8761) for ever H5769.
029:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Give H3051 (8798) unto the LORD H3068, O ye mighty H1121 H0410, give H3051 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 glory H3519 and strength H5797.
029:002 Give H3051 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 the glory H3519 due unto his name H8034; worship H7812 (8690) the LORD H3068 in the beauty H1927 of holiness H6944.
029:003 The voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 [is] upon the waters H4325: the God H0410 of glory H3519 thundereth H7481 (8689): the LORD H3068 [is] upon many H7227 waters H4325.
029:004 The voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 [is] powerful H3581; the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 [is] full of majesty H1926.
029:005 The voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 breaketh H7665 (8799) the cedars H0730; yea, the LORD H3068 breaketh H7665 (8762) the cedars H0730 of Lebanon H3844.
029:006 He maketh them also to skip H7540 (8686) like a calf H5695; Lebanon H3844 and Sirion H8303 like a young H1121 unicorn H7214.
029:007 The voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 divideth H2672 (8802) the flames H3852 of fire H0784.
029:008 The voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 shaketh H2342 (8799) the wilderness H4057; the LORD H3068 shaketh H2342 (8799) the wilderness H4057 of Kadesh H6946.
029:009 The voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 maketh the hinds H0355 to calve H2342 (8787), and discovereth H2834 (8799) the forests H3295: and in his temple H1964 doth every one speak H0559 (8802) of [his] glory H3519.
029:010 The LORD H3068 sitteth H3427 (8804) upon the flood H3999; yea, the LORD H3068 sitteth H3427 (8799) King H4428 for ever H5769.
029:011 The LORD H3068 will give H5414 (8799) strength H5797 unto his people H5971; the LORD H3068 will bless H1288 (8762) his people H5971 with peace H7965.
030:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 [and] Song H7892 [at] the dedication H2598 of the house H1004 of David H1732.» I will extol H7311 (8787) thee, O LORD H3068; for thou hast lifted me up H1802 (8765), and hast not made my foes H0341 (8802) to rejoice H8055 (8765) over me.
030:002 O LORD H3068 my God H0430, I cried H7768 (8765) unto thee, and thou hast healed H7495 (8799) me.
030:003 O LORD H3068, thou hast brought up H5927 (8689) my soul H5315 from the grave H7585: thou hast kept me alive H2421 (8765), that I should not go down H3381 (8800) (8675) H3381 (8802) to the pit H0953.
030:004 Sing H2167 (8761) unto the LORD H3068, O ye saints H2623 of his, and give thanks H3034 (8685) at the remembrance H2143 of his holiness H6944.
030:005 For his anger H0639 [endureth but] a moment H7281; in his favour H7522 [is] life H2416: weeping H1065 may endure H3885 (8799) for a night H6153, but joy H7440 [cometh] in the morning H1242.
030:006 And in my prosperity H7959 I said H0559 (8804), I shall never H5769 be moved H4131 (8735).
030:007 LORD H3068, by thy favour H7522 thou hast made my mountain H2042 to stand H5975 (8689) strong H5797: thou didst hide H5641 (8689) thy face H6440, [and] I was troubled H0926 (8737).
030:008 I cried H7121 (8799) to thee, O LORD H3068; and unto the LORD H3068 I made supplication H2603 (8691).
030:009 What profit H1215 [is there] in my blood H1818, when I go down H3381 (8800) to the pit H7845? Shall the dust H6083 praise H3034 (8686) thee? shall it declare H5046 (8686) thy truth H0571?
030:010 Hear H8085 (8798), O LORD H3068, and have mercy H2603 (8798) upon me: LORD H3068, be thou my helper H5826 (8802).
030:011 Thou hast turned H2015 (8804) for me my mourning H4553 into dancing H4234: thou hast put off H6605 (8765) my sackcloth H8242, and girded H0247 (8762) me with gladness H8057;
030:012 To the end that [my] glory H3519 may sing H2167 (8762) praise to thee, and not be silent H1826 (8799). O LORD H3068 my God H0430, I will give thanks H3034 (8686) unto thee for ever H5769.
031:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» In thee, O LORD H3068, do I put my trust H2620 (8804); let me never H0408 H5769 be ashamed H0954 (8799): deliver H6403 (8761) me in thy righteousness H6666.
031:002 Bow down H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241 to me; deliver H5337 (8685) me speedily H4120: be thou my strong H4581 rock H6697, for an house H1004 of defence H4686 to save H3467 (8687) me.
031:003 For thou [art] my rock H5553 and my fortress H4686; therefore for thy name’s H8034 sake lead H5148 (8686) me, and guide H5095 (8762) me.
031:004 Pull me out H3318 (8686) of the net H7568 that H2098 they have laid privily H2934 (8804) for me: for thou [art] my strength H4581.
031:005 Into thine hand H3027 I commit H6485 (8686) my spirit H7307: thou hast redeemed H6299 (8804) me, O LORD H3068 God H0410 of truth H0571.
031:006 I have hated H8130 (8804) them that regard H8104 (8802) lying H7723 vanities H1892: but I trust H0982 (8804) in the LORD H3068.
031:007 I will be glad H1523 (8799) and rejoice H8055 (8799) in thy mercy H2617: for thou hast considered H7200 (8804) my trouble H6040; thou hast known H3045 (8804) my soul H5315 in adversities H6869;
031:008 And hast not shut me up H5462 (8689) into the hand H3027 of the enemy H0341 (8802): thou hast set H5975 (8689) my feet H7272 in a large room H4800.
031:009 Have mercy H2603 (8798) upon me, O LORD H3068, for I am in trouble H6887 (8804): mine eye H5869 is consumed H6244 (8804) with grief H3708, [yea], my soul H5315 and my belly H0990.
031:010 For my life H2416 is spent H3615 (8804) with grief H3015, and my years H8141 with sighing H0585: my strength H3581 faileth H3782 (8804) because of mine iniquity H5771, and my bones H6106 are consumed H6244 (8804).
031:011 I was a reproach H2781 among all mine enemies H6887 (8802), but especially H3966 among my neighbours H7934, and a fear H6343 to mine acquaintance H3045 (8794): they that did see H7200 (8802) me without H2351 fled H5074 (8804) from me.
031:012 I am forgotten H7911 (8738) as a dead man H4191 (8801) out of mind H3820: I am like a broken H0006 (8802) vessel H3627.
031:013 For I have heard H8085 (8804) the slander H1681 of many H7227: fear H4032 [was] on every side H5439: while they took counsel H3245 (8736) together H3162 against me, they devised H2161 (8804) to take away H3947 (8800) my life H5315.
031:014 But I trusted H0982 (8804) in thee, O LORD H3068: I said H0559 (8804), Thou [art] my God H0430.
031:015 My times H6256 [are] in thy hand H3027: deliver H5337 (8685) me from the hand H3027 of mine enemies H0341 (8802), and from them that persecute H7291 (8802) me.
031:016 Make thy face H6440 to shine H0215 (8685) upon thy servant H5650: save H3467 (8685) me for thy mercies H2617 ’ sake.
031:017 Let me not be ashamed H0954 (8799), O LORD H3068; for I have called H7121 (8804) upon thee: let the wicked H7563 be ashamed H0954 (8799), [and] let them be silent H1826 (8799) in the grave H7585.
031:018 Let the lying H8267 lips H8193 be put to silence H0481 (8735); which speak H1696 (8802) grievous H6277 things proudly H1346 and contemptuously H0937 against the righteous H6662.
031:019 [Oh] how great H7227 [is] thy goodness H2898, which thou hast laid up H6845 (8804) for them that fear H3373 thee; [which] thou hast wrought H6466 (8804) for them that trust H2620 (8802) in thee before the sons H1121 of men H0120!
031:020 Thou shalt hide H5641 (8686) them in the secret H5643 of thy presence H6440 from the pride H7407 of man H0376: thou shalt keep them secretly H6845 (8799) in a pavilion H5521 from the strife H7379 of tongues H3956.
031:021 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068: for he hath shewed me his marvellous H6381 (8689) kindness H2617 in a strong H4692 city H5892.
031:022 For I said H0559 (8804) in my haste H2648 (8800), I am cut off H1629 (8738) from before H5048 thine eyes H5869: nevertheless H0403 thou heardest H8085 (8804) the voice H6963 of my supplications H8469 when I cried H7768 (8763) unto thee.
031:023 O love H0157 (8798) the LORD H3068, all ye his saints H2623: [for] the LORD H3068 preserveth H5341 (8802) the faithful H0539 (8803), and plentifully H3499 rewardeth H7999 (8764) the proud H1346 doer H6213 (8802).
031:024 Be of good courage H2388 (8798), and he shall strengthen H0553 (8686) your heart H3824, all ye that hope H3176 (8764) in the LORD H3068.
032:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732, Maschil H4905 (8688).» Blessed H0835 [is he whose] transgression H6588 [is] forgiven H5375 (8803), [whose] sin H2401 [is] covered H3680 (8803).
032:002 Blessed H0835 [is] the man H0120 unto whom the LORD H3068 imputeth H2803 (8799) not iniquity H5771, and in whose spirit H7307 [there is] no guile H7423.
032:003 When I kept silence H2790 (8689), my bones H6106 waxed old H1086 (8804) through my roaring H7581 all the day H3117 long.
032:004 For day H3119 and night H3915 thy hand H3027 was heavy H3513 (8799) upon me: my moisture H3955 is turned H2015 (8738) into the drought H2725 of summer H7019. Selah H5542.
032:005 I acknowledged H3045 (8686) my sin H2403 unto thee, and mine iniquity H5771 have I not hid H3680 (8765). I said H0559 (8804), I will confess H3034 (8686) my transgressions H6588 unto the LORD H3068; and thou forgavest H5375 (8804) the iniquity H5771 of my sin H2403. Selah H5542.
032:006 For this shall every one that is godly H2623 pray H6419 (8691) unto thee in a time H6256 when thou mayest be found H4672 (8800): surely in the floods H7858 of great H7227 waters H4325 they shall not come nigh H5060 (8686) unto him.
032:007 Thou [art] my hiding place H5643; thou shalt preserve H5341 (8799) me from trouble H6862; thou shalt compass H5437 (8779) me about with songs H7438 of deliverance H6405. Selah H5542.
032:008 I will instruct H7919 (8686) thee and teach H3384 (8686) thee in the way H1870 which H2098 thou shalt go H3212 (8799): I will guide H3289 (8799) thee with mine eye H5869.
032:009 Be ye not as the horse H5483, [or] as the mule H6505, [which] have no understanding H0995 (8687): whose mouth H5716 must be held H1102 (8800) in with bit H4964 and bridle H7448, lest H1077 they come near H7126 (8800) unto thee.
032:010 Many H7227 sorrows H4341 [shall be] to the wicked H7563: but he that trusteth H0982 (8802) in the LORD H3068, mercy H2617 shall compass H5437 (8779) him about.
032:011 Be glad H8055 (8798) in the LORD H3068, and rejoice H1523 (8798), ye righteous H6662: and shout H7442 (8685) for joy, all [ye that are] upright H3477 in heart H3820.
033:001 ¶  Rejoice H7442 (8761) in the LORD H3068, O ye righteous H6662: [for] praise H8416 is comely H5000 for the upright H3477.
033:002 Praise H3034 (8685) the LORD H3068 with harp H3658: sing H2167 (8761) unto him with the psaltery H5035 [and] an instrument of ten strings H6218.
033:003 Sing H7891 (8798) unto him a new H2319 song H7892; play H5059 (8763) skilfully H3190 (8685) with a loud noise H8643.
033:004 For the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 [is] right H3477; and all his works H4639 [are done] in truth H0530.
033:005 He loveth H0157 (8802) righteousness H6666 and judgment H4941: the earth H0776 is full H4390 (8804) of the goodness H2617 of the LORD H3068.
033:006 By the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 were the heavens H8064 made H6213 (8738); and all the host H6635 of them by the breath H7307 of his mouth H6310.
033:007 He gathereth H3664 (8802) the waters H4325 of the sea H3220 together as an heap H5067: he layeth up H5414 (8802) the depth H8415 in storehouses H0214.
033:008 Let all the earth H0776 fear H3372 (8799) the LORD H3068: let all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the world H8398 stand in awe H1481 (8799) of him.
033:009 For he spake H0559 (8804), and it was [done]; he commanded H6680 (8765), and it stood fast H5975 (8799).
033:010 The LORD H3068 bringeth H6331 the counsel H6098 of the heathen H1471 to nought H6331 (8689): he maketh H5106 the devices H4284 of the people H5971 of none effect H5106 (8689).
033:011 The counsel H6098 of the LORD H3068 standeth H5975 (8799) for ever H5769, the thoughts H4284 of his heart H3820 to all H1755 generations H1755.
033:012 Blessed H0835 [is] the nation H1471 whose God H0430 [is] the LORD H3068; [and] the people H5971 [whom] he hath chosen H0977 (8804) for his own inheritance H5159.
033:013 The LORD H3068 looketh H5027 (8689) from heaven H8064; he beholdeth H7200 (8804) all the sons H1121 of men H0120.
033:014 From the place H4349 of his habitation H3427 (8800) he looketh H7688 (8689) upon all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the earth H0776.
033:015 He fashioneth H3335 (8802) their hearts H3820 alike H3162; he considereth H0995 (8688) all their works H4639.
033:016 There is no king H4428 saved H3467 (8737) by the multitude H7230 of an host H2428: a mighty man H1368 is not delivered H5337 (8735) by much H7230 strength H3581.
033:017 An horse H5483 [is] a vain thing H8267 for safety H8668: neither shall he deliver H4422 (8762) [any] by his great H7230 strength H2428.
033:018 Behold, the eye H5869 of the LORD H3068 [is] upon them that fear H3373 him, upon them that hope H3176 (8764) in his mercy H2617;
033:019 To deliver H5337 (8687) their soul H5315 from death H4194, and to keep them alive H2421 (8763) in famine H7458.
033:020 Our soul H5315 waiteth H2442 (8765) for the LORD H3068: he [is] our help H5828 and our shield H4043.
033:021 For our heart H3820 shall rejoice H8055 (8799) in him, because we have trusted H0982 (8804) in his holy H6944 name H8034.
033:022 Let thy mercy H2617, O LORD H3068, be upon us, according as we hope H3176 (8765) in thee.
034:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732, when he changed H8138 (8763) his behaviour H2940 before H6440 Abimelech H0040; who drove him away H1644 (8762), and he departed H3212 (8799).» I will bless H1288 (8762) the LORD H3068 at all times H6256: his praise H8416 [shall] continually H8548 [be] in my mouth H6310.
034:002 My soul H5315 shall make her boast H1984 (8691) in the LORD H3068: the humble H6035 shall hear H8085 (8799) [thereof], and be glad H8055 (8799).
034:003 O magnify H1431 (8761) the LORD H3068 with me, and let us exalt H7311 (8787) his name H8034 together H3162.
034:004 I sought H1875 (8804) the LORD H3068, and he heard H6030 (8804) me, and delivered H5337 (8689) me from all my fears H4035.
034:005 They looked H5027 (8689) unto him, and were lightened H5102 (8804): and their faces H6440 were not ashamed H2659 (8799).
034:006 This poor man H6041 cried H7121 (8804), and the LORD H3068 heard H8085 (8804) [him], and saved H3467 (8689) him out of all his troubles H6869.
034:007 The angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 encampeth H2583 (8802) round about H5439 them that fear H3373 him, and delivereth H2502 (8762) them.
034:008 O taste H2938 (8798) and see H7200 (8798) that the LORD H3068 [is] good H2896: blessed H0835 [is] the man H1397 [that] trusteth H2620 (8799) in him.
034:009 O fear H3372 (8798) the LORD H3068, ye his saints H6918: for [there is] no want H4270 to them that fear H3373 him.
034:010 The young lions H3715 do lack H7326 (8804), and suffer hunger H7456 (8804): but they that seek H1875 (8802) the LORD H3068 shall not want H2637 (8799) any good H2896 [thing].
034:011 Come H3212 (8798), ye children H1121, hearken H8085 (8798) unto me: I will teach H3925 (8762) you the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068.
034:012 What man H0376 [is he that] desireth H2655 life H2416, [and] loveth H0157 (8802) [many] days H3117, that he may see H7200 (8800) good H2896?
034:013 Keep H5341 (8798) thy tongue H3956 from evil H7451, and thy lips H8193 from speaking H1696 (8763) guile H4820.
034:014 Depart H5493 (8798) from evil H7451, and do H6213 (8798) good H2896; seek H1245 (8761) peace H7965, and pursue H7291 (8798) it.
034:015 The eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068 [are] upon the righteous H6662, and his ears H0241 [are open] unto their cry H7775.
034:016 The face H6440 of the LORD H3068 [is] against them that do H6213 (8802) evil H7451, to cut off H3772 (8687) the remembrance H2143 of them from the earth H0776.
034:017 [The righteous] cry H6817 (8804), and the LORD H3068 heareth H8085 (8804), and delivereth H5337 (8689) them out of all their troubles H6869.
034:018 The LORD H3068 [is] nigh H7138 unto them that are of a broken H7665 (8737) heart H3820; and saveth H3467 (8686) such as be of a contrite H1793 spirit H7307.
034:019 Many H7227 [are] the afflictions H7451 of the righteous H6662: but the LORD H3068 delivereth H5337 (8686) him out of them all.
034:020 He keepeth H8104 (8802) all his bones H6106: not one H0259 of them H2007 is broken H7665 (8738).
034:021 Evil H7451 shall slay H4191 (8787) the wicked H7563: and they that hate H8130 (8802) the righteous H6662 shall be desolate H0816 (8799).
034:022 The LORD H3068 redeemeth H6299 (8802) the soul H5315 of his servants H5650: and none of them that trust H2620 (8802) in him shall be desolate H0816 (8799).
035:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732.» Plead H7378 (8798) [my cause], O LORD H3068, with them that strive H3401 with me: fight H3898 (8798) against them that fight H3898 (8802) against me.
035:002 Take hold H2388 (8685) of shield H4043 and buckler H6793, and stand up H6965 (8798) for mine help H5833.
035:003 Draw out H7324 (8685) also the spear H2595, and stop H5462 (8798) [the way] against H7125 (8800) them that persecute H7291 (8802) me: say H0559 (8798) unto my soul H5315, I [am] thy salvation H3444.
035:004 Let them be confounded H0954 (8799) and put to shame H3637 (8735) that seek H1245 (8764) after my soul H5315: let them be turned H5472 (8735) back H0268 and brought to confusion H2659 (8799) that devise H2803 (8802) my hurt H7451.
035:005 Let them be as chaff H4671 before H6440 the wind H7307: and let the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 chase H1760 (8802) [them].
035:006 Let their way H1870 be dark H2822 and slippery H2519: and let the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 persecute H7291 (8802) them.
035:007 For without cause H2600 have they hid H2934 (8804) for me their net H7568 [in] a pit H7845, [which] without cause H2600 they have digged H2658 (8804) for my soul H5315.
035:008 Let destruction H7722 come H0935 (8799) upon him at unawares H3045 (8799) H3808; and let his net H7568 that he hath hid H2934 (8804) catch H3920 (8799) himself: into that very destruction H7722 let him fall H5307 (8799).
035:009 And my soul H5315 shall be joyful H1523 (8799) in the LORD H3068: it shall rejoice H7797 (8799) in his salvation H3444.
035:010 All my bones H6106 shall say H0559 (8799), LORD H3068, who [is] like unto thee, which deliverest H5337 (8688) the poor H6041 from him that is too strong H2389 for him, yea, the poor H6041 and the needy H0034 from him that spoileth H1497 (8802) him?
035:011 False H2555 witnesses H5707 did rise up H6965 (8799); they laid to my charge H7592 (8799) [things] that I knew H3045 (8804) not.
035:012 They rewarded H7999 (8762) me evil H7451 for good H2896 [to] the spoiling H7908 of my soul H5315.
035:013 But as for me, when they were sick H2470 (8800), my clothing H3830 [was] sackcloth H8242: I humbled H6031 (8765) my soul H5315 with fasting H6685; and my prayer H8605 returned H7725 (8799) into mine own bosom H2436.
035:014 I behaved H1980 (8694) myself as though [he had been] my friend H7453 [or] brother H0251: I bowed down H7817 (8804) heavily H6937 (8802), as one that mourneth H0057 [for his] mother H0517.
035:015 But in mine adversity H6761 they rejoiced H8055 (8804), and gathered themselves together H0622 (8738): [yea], the abjects H5222 gathered themselves together H0622 (8738) against me, and I knew H3045 (8804) [it] not; they did tear H7167 (8804) [me], and ceased H1826 (8804) not:
035:016 With hypocritical H2611 mockers H3934 in feasts H4580, they gnashed H2786 (8800) upon me with their teeth H8127.
035:017 Lord H0136, how long wilt thou look on H7200 (8799)? rescue H7725 (8685) my soul H5315 from their destructions H7722, my darling H3173 from the lions H3715.
035:018 I will give thee thanks H3034 (8686) in the great H7227 congregation H6951: I will praise H1984 (8762) thee among much H6099 people H5971.
035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies H0341 (8802) wrongfully H8267 rejoice H8055 (8799) over me: [neither] let them wink H7169 (8799) with the eye H5869 that hate H8130 (8802) me without a cause H2600.
035:020 For they speak H1696 (8762) not peace H7965: but they devise H2803 (8799) deceitful H4820 matters H1697 against [them that are] quiet H7282 in the land H0776.
035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth H6310 wide H7337 (8686) against me, [and] said H0559 (8804), Aha H1889, aha H1889, our eye H5869 hath seen H7200 (8804) [it].
035:022 [This] thou hast seen H7200 (8804), O LORD H3068: keep not silence H2790 (8799): O Lord H0136, be not far H7368 (8799) from me.
035:023 Stir up H5782 (8685) thyself, and awake H6974 (8685) to my judgment H4941, [even] unto my cause H7379, my God H0430 and my Lord H0136.
035:024 Judge H8199 (8798) me, O LORD H3068 my God H0430, according to thy righteousness H6664; and let them not rejoice H8055 (8799) over me.
035:025 Let them not say H0559 (8799) in their hearts H3820, Ah H1889, so would we have it H5315: let them not say H0559 (8799), We have swallowed him up H1104 (8765).
035:026 Let them be ashamed H0954 (8799) and brought to confusion H2659 (8799) together H3162 that rejoice H8056 at mine hurt H7451: let them be clothed H3847 (8799) with shame H1322 and dishonour H3639 that magnify H1431 (8688) [themselves] against me.
035:027 Let them shout for joy H7442 (8799), and be glad H8055 (8799), that favour H2655 my righteous cause H6664: yea, let them say H0559 (8799) continually H8548, Let the LORD H3068 be magnified H1431 (8799), which hath pleasure H2655 in the prosperity H7965 of his servant H5650.
035:028 And my tongue H3956 shall speak H1897 (8799) of thy righteousness H6664 [and] of thy praise H8416 all the day H3117 long.
036:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), [A Psalm] of David H1732 the servant H5650 of the LORD H3068.» The transgression H6588 of the wicked H7563 saith H5002 (8803) within H7130 my heart H3820, [that there is] no fear H6343 of God H0430 before his eyes H5869.
036:002 For he flattereth H2505 (8689) himself in his own eyes H5869, until his iniquity H5771 be found H4672 (8800) to be hateful H8130 (8800).
036:003 The words H1697 of his mouth H6310 [are] iniquity H0205 and deceit H4820: he hath left off H2308 (8804) to be wise H7919 (8687), [and] to do good H3190 (8687).
036:004 He deviseth H2803 (8799) mischief H0205 upon his bed H4904; he setteth H3320 (8691) himself in a way H1870 [that is] not good H2896; he abhorreth H3988 (8799) not evil H7451.
036:005 Thy mercy H2617, O LORD H3068, [is] in the heavens H8064; [and] thy faithfulness H0530 [reacheth] unto the clouds H7834.
036:006 Thy righteousness H6666 [is] like the great H0410 mountains H2042; thy judgments H4941 [are] a great H7227 deep H8415: O LORD H3068, thou preservest H3467 (8686) man H0120 and beast H0929.
036:007 How excellent H3368 [is] thy lovingkindness H2617, O God H0430! therefore the children H1121 of men H0120 put their trust H2620 (8799) under the shadow H6738 of thy wings H3671.
036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied H7301 (8799) with the fatness H1880 of thy house H1004; and thou shalt make them drink H8248 (8686) of the river H5158 of thy pleasures H5730.
036:009 For with thee [is] the fountain H4726 of life H2416: in thy light H0216 shall we see H7200 (8799) light H0216.
036:010 O continue H4900 (8798) thy lovingkindness H2617 unto them that know H3045 (8802) thee; and thy righteousness H6666 to the upright H3477 in heart H3820.
036:011 Let not the foot H7272 of pride H1346 come H0935 (8799) against me, and let not the hand H3027 of the wicked H7563 remove H5110 (8686) me.
036:012 There are the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205 fallen H5307 (8804): they are cast down H1760 (8795), and shall not be able H3201 (8804) to rise H6965 (8800).
037:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732.» Fret H2734 (8691) not thyself because of evildoers H7489 (8688), neither be thou envious H7065 (8762) against the workers H6213 (8802) of iniquity H5766.
037:002 For they shall soon H4120 be cut down H5243 (8799) like the grass H2682, and wither H5034 (8799) as the green H3418 herb H1877.
037:003 Trust H0982 (8798) in the LORD H3068, and do H6213 (8798) good H2896; [so] shalt thou dwell H7931 (8798) in the land H0776, and verily H0530 thou shalt be fed H7462 (8798).
037:004 Delight H6026 (8690) thyself also in the LORD H3068; and he shall give H5414 (8799) thee the desires H4862 of thine heart H3820.
037:005 Commit H1556 (8798) thy way H1870 unto the LORD H3068; trust H0982 (8798) also in him; and he shall bring [it] to pass H6213 (8799).
037:006 And he shall bring forth H3318 (8689) thy righteousness H6664 as the light H0216, and thy judgment H4941 as the noonday H6672.
037:007 Rest H1826 (8798) in the LORD H3068, and wait patiently H2342 (8708) for him: fret H2734 (8691) not thyself because of him who prospereth H6743 (8688) in his way H1870, because of the man H0376 who bringeth H6213 wicked devices H4209 to pass H6213 (8802).
037:008 Cease H7503 (8685) from anger H0639, and forsake H5800 (8798) wrath H2534: fret H2734 (8691) not thyself in any wise H0389 to do evil H7489 (8687).
037:009 For evildoers H7489 (8688) shall be cut off H3772 (8735): but those that wait H6960 (8802) upon the LORD H3068, they shall inherit H3423 (8799) the earth H0776.
037:010 For yet a little while H4592, and the wicked H7563 [shall] not [be]: yea, thou shalt diligently consider H0995 (8712) his place H4725, and it [shall] not [be].
037:011 But the meek H6035 shall inherit H3423 (8799) the earth H0776; and shall delight H6026 (8694) themselves in the abundance H7230 of peace H7965.
037:012 The wicked H7563 plotteth H2161 (8802) against the just H6662, and gnasheth H2786 (8802) upon him with his teeth H8127.
037:013 The Lord H0136 shall laugh H7832 (8799) at him: for he seeth H7200 (8804) that his day H3117 is coming H0935 (8799).
037:014 The wicked H7563 have drawn out H6605 (8804) the sword H2719, and have bent H1869 (8804) their bow H7198, to cast down H5307 (8687) the poor H6041 and needy H0034, [and] to slay H2873 (8800) such as be of upright H3477 conversation H1870.
037:015 Their sword H2719 shall enter H0935 (8799) into their own heart H3820, and their bows H7198 shall be broken H7665 (8735).
037:016 A little H4592 that a righteous man H6662 hath [is] better H2896 than the riches H1995 of many H7227 wicked H7563.
037:017 For the arms H2220 of the wicked H7563 shall be broken H7665 (8735): but the LORD H3068 upholdeth H5564 (8802) the righteous H6662.
037:018 The LORD H3068 knoweth H3045 (8802) the days H3117 of the upright H8549: and their inheritance H5159 shall be for ever H5769.
037:019 They shall not be ashamed H0954 (8799) in the evil H7451 time H6256: and in the days H3117 of famine H7459 they shall be satisfied H7646 (8799).
037:020 But the wicked H7563 shall perish H0006 (8799), and the enemies H0341 (8802) of the LORD H3068 [shall be] as the fat H3368 of lambs H3733: they shall consume H3615 (8804); into smoke H6227 shall they consume away H3615 (8804).
037:021 The wicked H7563 borroweth H3867 (8801), and payeth not again H7999 (8762): but the righteous H6662 sheweth mercy H2603 (8802), and giveth H5414 (8802).
037:022 For [such as be] blessed H1288 (8794) of him shall inherit H3423 (8799) the earth H0776; and [they that be] cursed H7043 (8794) of him shall be cut off H3772 (8735).
037:023 The steps H4703 of a [good] man H1397 are ordered H3559 (8797) by the LORD H3068: and he delighteth H2654 (8799) in his way H1870.
037:024 Though he fall H5307 (8799), he shall not be utterly cast down H2904 (8714): for the LORD H3068 upholdeth H5564 (8802) [him with] his hand H3027.
037:025 I have been young H5288, and [now] am old H2204 (8804); yet have I not seen H7200 (8804) the righteous H6662 forsaken H5800 (8737), nor his seed H2233 begging H1245 (8764) bread H3899.
037:026 [He is] ever H3117 merciful H2603 (8802), and lendeth H3867 (8688); and his seed H2233 [is] blessed H1293.
037:027 Depart H5493 (8798) from evil H7451, and do H6213 (8798) good H2896; and dwell H7931 (8798) for evermore H5769.
037:028 For the LORD H3068 loveth H0157 (8802) judgment H4941, and forsaketh H5800 (8799) not his saints H2623; they are preserved H8104 (8738) for ever H5769: but the seed H2233 of the wicked H7563 shall be cut off H3772 (8738).
037:029 The righteous H6662 shall inherit H3423 (8799) the land H0776, and dwell H7931 (8799) therein for ever H5703.
037:030 The mouth H6310 of the righteous H6662 speaketh H1897 (8799) wisdom H2451, and his tongue H3956 talketh H1696 (8762) of judgment H4941.
037:031 The law H8451 of his God H0430 [is] in his heart H3820; none of his steps H0838 shall slide H4571 (8799).
037:032 The wicked H7563 watcheth H6822 (8802) the righteous H6662, and seeketh H1245 (8764) to slay H4191 (8687) him.
037:033 The LORD H3068 will not leave H5800 (8799) him in his hand H3027, nor condemn H7561 (8686) him when he is judged H8199 (8736).
037:034 Wait H6960 (8761) on the LORD H3068, and keep H8104 (8798) his way H1870, and he shall exalt H7311 (8787) thee to inherit H3423 (8800) the land H0776: when the wicked H7563 are cut off H3772 (8736), thou shalt see H7200 (8799) [it].
037:035 I have seen H7200 (8804) the wicked H7563 in great power H6184, and spreading H6168 (8693) himself like a green H7488 bay tree H0249.
037:036 Yet he passed away H5674 (8799), and, lo, he [was] not: yea, I sought H1245 (8762) him, but he could not be found H4672 (8738).
037:037 Mark H8104 (8798) the perfect H8535 [man], and behold H7200 (8798) the upright H3477: for the end H0319 of [that] man H0376 [is] peace H7965.
037:038 But the transgressors H6586 (8802) shall be destroyed H8045 (8738) together H3162: the end H0319 of the wicked H7563 shall be cut off H3772 (8738).
037:039 But the salvation H8668 of the righteous H6662 [is] of the LORD H3068: [he is] their strength H4581 in the time H6256 of trouble H6869.
037:040 And the LORD H3068 shall help H5826 (8799) them, and deliver H6403 (8762) them: he shall deliver H6403 (8762) them from the wicked H7563, and save H3467 (8686) them, because they trust H2620 (8804) in him.
038:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732, to bring to remembrance H2142 (8687).» O LORD H3068, rebuke H3198 (8686) me not in thy wrath H7110: neither chasten H3256 (8762) me in thy hot displeasure H2534.
038:002 For thine arrows H2671 stick fast H5181 (8738) in me, and thy hand H3027 presseth me sore H5181 (8799).
038:003 [There is] no soundness H4974 in my flesh H1320 because H6440 of thine anger H2195; neither [is there any] rest H7965 in my bones H6106 because H6440 of my sin H2403.
038:004 For mine iniquities H5771 are gone over H5674 (8804) mine head H7218: as an heavy H3515 burden H4853 they are too heavy H3513 (8799) for me.
038:005 My wounds H2250 stink H0887 (8689) [and] are corrupt H4743 (8738) because H6440 of my foolishness H0200.
038:006 I am troubled H5753 (8738); I am bowed down H7817 (8804) greatly H3966; I go H1980 (8765) mourning H6937 (8802) all the day H3117 long.
038:007 For my loins H3689 are filled H4390 (8804) with a loathsome H7033 (8737) [disease]: and [there is] no soundness H4974 in my flesh H1320.
038:008 I am feeble H6313 (8738) and sore H3966 broken H1794 (8738): I have roared H7580 (8804) by reason of the disquietness H5100 of my heart H3820.
038:009 Lord H0136, all my desire H8378 [is] before thee; and my groaning H0585 is not hid H5641 (8738) from thee.
038:010 My heart H3820 panteth H5503 (8773), my strength H3581 faileth H5800 (8804) me: as for the light H0216 of mine eyes H5869, it H1992 also is gone H0369 from me.
038:011 My lovers H0157 (8802) and my friends H7453 stand H5975 (8799) aloof from H5048 my sore H5061; and my kinsmen H7138 stand H5975 (8804) afar off H7350.
038:012 They also that seek H1245 (8764) after my life H5315 lay snares H5367 (8762) [for me]: and they that seek H1875 (8802) my hurt H7451 speak H1696 (8765) mischievous things H1942, and imagine H1897 (8799) deceits H4820 all the day H3117 long.
038:013 But I, as a deaf H2795 [man], heard H8085 (8799) not; and [I was] as a dumb man H0483 [that] openeth H6605 (8799) not his mouth H6310.
038:014 Thus I was as a man H0376 that heareth H8085 (8802) not, and in whose mouth H6310 [are] no reproofs H8433.
038:015 For in thee, O LORD H3068, do I hope H3176 (8689): thou wilt hear H6030 (8799), O Lord H0136 my God H0430.
038:016 For I said H0559 (8804), [Hear me], lest [otherwise] they should rejoice H8055 (8799) over me: when my foot H7272 slippeth H4131 (8800), they magnify H1431 (8689) [themselves] against me.
038:017 For I [am] ready H3559 (8737) to halt H6761, and my sorrow H4341 [is] continually H8548 before me.
038:018 For I will declare H5046 (8686) mine iniquity H5771; I will be sorry H1672 (8799) for my sin H2403.
038:019 But mine enemies H0341 (8802) [are] lively H2416, [and] they are strong H6105 (8804): and they that hate H8130 (8802) me wrongfully H8267 are multiplied H7231 (8804).
038:020 They also that render H7999 (8764) evil H7451 for good H2896 are mine adversaries H7853 (8799); because I follow H7291 (8800) [the thing that] good H2896 [is].
038:021 Forsake H5800 (8799) me not, O LORD H3068: O my God H0430, be not far H7368 (8799) from me.
038:022 Make haste H2363 (8798) to help H5833 me, O Lord H0136 my salvation H8668.
039:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), [even] to Jeduthun H3038, A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» I said H0559 (8804), I will take heed H8104 (8799) to my ways H1870, that I sin H2398 (8800) not with my tongue H3956: I will keep H8104 (8799) my mouth H6310 with a bridle H4269, while the wicked H7563 is before me.
039:002 I was dumb H0481 (8738) with silence H1747, I held my peace H2814 (8689), [even] from good H2896; and my sorrow H3511 was stirred H5916 (8738).
039:003 My heart H3820 was hot H2552 (8804) within H7130 me, while I was musing H1901 the fire H0784 burned H1197 (8799): [then] H0227 spake H1696 (8765) I with my tongue H3956,
039:004 LORD H3068, make me to know H3045 (8685) mine end H7093, and the measure H4060 of my days H3117, what it [is; that] I may know H3045 (8799) how frail H2310 I [am].
039:005 Behold, thou hast made H5414 (8804) my days H3117 [as] an handbreadth H2947; and mine age H2465 [is] as nothing before thee: verily every H3605 man H0120 at his best state H5324 (8737) [is] altogether H3605 vanity H1892. Selah H5542.
039:006 Surely every man H0376 walketh H1980 (8691) in a vain shew H6754: surely they are disquieted H1993 (8799) in vain H1892: he heapeth up H6651 (8799) [riches], and knoweth H3045 (8799) not who shall gather H0622 (8802) them.
039:007 And now, Lord H0136, what wait H6960 (8765) I for? my hope H8431 [is] in thee.
039:008 Deliver H5337 (8685) me from all my transgressions H6588: make H7760 (8799) me not the reproach H2781 of the foolish H5036.
039:009 I was dumb H0481 (8738), I opened H6605 (8799) not my mouth H6310; because thou didst H6213 (8804) [it].
039:010 Remove H5493 thy stroke H5061 away H5493 (8685) from me: I am consumed H3615 (8804) by the blow H8409 of thine hand H3027.
039:011 When thou with rebukes H8433 dost correct H3256 (8765) man H0376 for iniquity H5771, thou makest his beauty H2530 (8803) to consume away H4529 (8686) like a moth H6211: surely every man H0120 [is] vanity H1892. Selah H5542.
039:012 Hear H8085 (8798) my prayer H8605, O LORD H3068, and give ear H0238 (8685) unto my cry H7775; hold not thy peace H2790 (8799) at my tears H1832: for I [am] a stranger H1616 with thee, [and] a sojourner H8453, as all my fathers H0001 [were].
039:013 O spare H8159 (8685) me, that I may recover strength H1082 (8686), before I go hence H3212 (8799), and be no more.
040:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» I waited H6960 (8765) patiently H6960 (8763) for the LORD H3068; and he inclined H5186 (8799) unto me, and heard H8085 (8799) my cry H7775.
040:002 He brought me up H5927 (8686) also out of an horrible H7588 pit H0953, out of the miry H3121 clay H2916, and set H6965 (8686) my feet H7272 upon a rock H5553, [and] established H3559 (8790) my goings H0838.
040:003 And he hath put H5414 (8799) a new H2319 song H7892 in my mouth H6310, [even] praise H8416 unto our God H0430: many H7227 shall see H7200 (8799) [it], and fear H3372 (8799), and shall trust H0982 (8799) in the LORD H3068.
040:004 Blessed H0835 [is] that man H1397 that maketh H7760 (8804) the LORD H3068 his trust H4009, and respecteth H6437 (8804) not the proud H7295, nor such as turn aside H7750 (8802) to lies H3577.
040:005 Many H7227, O LORD H3068 my God H0430, [are] thy wonderful H6381 (8737) works [which] thou hast done H6213 (8804), and thy thoughts H4284 [which are] to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order H6186 (8800) unto thee: [if] I would declare H5046 (8686) and speak H1696 (8762) [of them], they are more H6105 (8804) than can be numbered H5608 (8763).
040:006 Sacrifice H2077 and offering H4503 thou didst not desire H2654 (8804); mine ears H0241 hast thou opened H3738 (8804): burnt offering H5930 and sin offering H2401 hast thou not required H7592 (8804).
040:007 Then said H0559 (8804) I, Lo, I come H0935 (8804): in the volume H4039 of the book H5612 [it is] written H3789 (8803) of me,
040:008 I delight H2654 (8804) to do H6213 (8800) thy will H7522, O my God H0430: yea, thy law H8451 [is] within H8432 my heart H4578.
040:009 I have preached H1319 (8765) righteousness H6664 in the great H7227 congregation H6951: lo, I have not refrained H3607 (8799) my lips H8193, O LORD H3068, thou knowest H3045 (8804).
040:010 I have not hid H3680 (8765) thy righteousness H6666 within H8432 my heart H3820; I have declared H0559 (8804) thy faithfulness H0530 and thy salvation H8668: I have not concealed H3582 (8765) thy lovingkindness H2617 and thy truth H0571 from the great H7227 congregation H6951.
040:011 Withhold H3607 (8799) not thou thy tender mercies H7356 from me, O LORD H3068: let thy lovingkindness H2617 and thy truth H0571 continually H8548 preserve H5341 (8799) me.
040:012 For innumerable H4557 evils H7451 have compassed H0661 (8804) me about: mine iniquities H5771 have taken hold H5381 (8689) upon me, so that I am not able H3201 (8804) to look up H7200 (8800); they are more H6105 (8804) than the hairs H8185 of mine head H7218: therefore my heart H3820 faileth H5800 (8804) me.
040:013 Be pleased H7521 (8798), O LORD H3068, to deliver H5337 (8687) me: O LORD H3068, make haste H2363 (8798) to help H5833 me.
040:014 Let them be ashamed H0954 (8799) and confounded H2659 (8799) together H3162 that seek H1245 (8764) after my soul H5315 to destroy H5595 (8800) it; let them be driven H5472 (8735) backward H0268 and put to shame H3637 (8735) that wish H2655 me evil H7451.
040:015 Let them be desolate H8074 (8799) for a reward H6118 of their shame H1322 that say H0559 (8802) unto me, Aha H1889, aha H1889.
040:016 Let all those that seek H1245 (8764) thee rejoice H7797 (8799) and be glad H8055 (8799) in thee: let such as love H0157 (8802) thy salvation H8668 say H0559 (8799) continually H8548, The LORD H3068 be magnified H1431 (8799).
040:017 But I [am] poor H6041 and needy H0034; [yet] the Lord H0136 thinketh H2803 (8799) upon me: thou [art] my help H5833 and my deliverer H6403 (8764); make no tarrying H0309 (8762), O my God H0430.
041:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Blessed H0835 [is] he that considereth H7919 (8688) the poor H1800: the LORD H3068 will deliver H4422 (8762) him in time H3117 of trouble H7451.
041:002 The LORD H3068 will preserve H8104 (8799) him, and keep him alive H2421 (8762); [and] he shall be blessed H0833 (8795) upon the earth H0776: and thou wilt not deliver H5414 (8799) him unto the will H5315 of his enemies H0341 (8802).
041:003 The LORD H3068 will strengthen H5582 (8799) him upon the bed H6210 of languishing H1741: thou wilt make H2015 (8804) all his bed H4904 in his sickness H2483.
041:004 I said H0559 (8804), LORD H3068, be merciful H2603 (8798) unto me: heal H7495 (8798) my soul H5315; for I have sinned H2398 (8804) against thee.
041:005 Mine enemies H0341 (8802) speak H0559 (8799) evil H7451 of me, When shall he die H4191 (8799), and his name H8034 perish H0006 (8804)?
041:006 And if he come H0935 (8804) to see H7200 (8800) [me], he speaketh H1696 (8762) vanity H7723: his heart H3820 gathereth H6908 (8799) iniquity H0205 to itself; [when] he goeth H3318 (8799) abroad H2351, he telleth H1696 (8762) [it].
041:007 All that hate H8130 (8802) me whisper H3907 (8691) together H3162 against me: against me do they devise H2803 (8799) my hurt H7451.
041:008 An evil H1100 disease H1697, [say they], cleaveth fast H3332 (8803) unto him: and [now] that he lieth H7901 (8804) he shall rise up H6965 (8800) no more H3254 (8686).
041:009 Yea, mine own familiar H7965 friend H0376, in whom I trusted H0982 (8804), which did eat H0398 (8802) of my bread H3899, hath lifted up H1431 (8689) [his] heel H6119 against me.
041:010 But thou, O LORD H3068, be merciful H2603 (8798) unto me, and raise me up H6965 (8685), that I may requite H7999 (8762) them.
041:011 By this I know H3045 (8804) that thou favourest H2654 (8804) me, because mine enemy H0341 (8802) doth not triumph H7321 (8686) over me.
041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest H8551 (8804) me in mine integrity H8537, and settest H5324 (8686) me before thy face H6440 for ever H5769.
041:013 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 from everlasting H5769, and to everlasting H5769. Amen H0543, and Amen H0543.
042:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), Maschil H4905 (8688), for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141.» As the hart H0354 panteth H6165 (8799) after the water H4325 brooks H0650, so panteth H6165 (8799) my soul H5315 after thee, O God H0430.
042:002 My soul H5315 thirsteth H6770 (8804) for God H0430, for the living H2416 God H0410: when shall I come H0935 (8799) and appear H7200 (8735) before H6440 God H0430?
042:003 My tears H1832 have been my meat H3899 day H3119 and night H3915, while they continually H3117 say H0559 (8800) unto me, Where [is] thy God H0430?
042:004 When I remember H2142 (8799) these [things], I pour out H8210 (8799) my soul H5315 in me: for I had gone H5674 (8799) with the multitude H5519, I went H1718 (8691) with them to the house H1004 of God H0430, with the voice H6963 of joy H7440 and praise H8426, with a multitude H1995 that kept holyday H2287 (8802).
042:005 Why art thou cast down H7817 (8709), O my soul H5315? and [why] art thou disquieted H1993 (8799) in me? hope H3176 (8685) thou in God H0430: for I shall yet praise H3034 (8686) him [for] the help H3444 of his countenance H6440.
042:006 O my God H0430, my soul H5315 is cast down H7817 (8709) within me: therefore will I remember H2142 (8799) thee from the land H0776 of Jordan H3383, and of the Hermonites H2769, from the hill H2022 Mizar H4706.
042:007 Deep H8415 calleth H7121 (8802) unto deep H8415 at the noise H6963 of thy waterspouts H6794: all thy waves H4867 and thy billows H1530 are gone H5674 (8804) over me.
042:008 [Yet] the LORD H3068 will command H6680 (8762) his lovingkindness H2617 in the daytime H3119, and in the night H3915 his song H7892 [shall be] with me, [and] my prayer H8605 unto the God H0410 of my life H2416.
042:009 I will say H0559 (8799) unto God H0410 my rock H5553, Why hast thou forgotten H7911 (8804) me? why go H3212 (8799) I mourning H6937 (8802) because of the oppression H3906 of the enemy H0341 (8802)?
042:010 [As] with a sword H7524 in my bones H6106, mine enemies H6887 (8802) reproach H2778 (8765) me; while they say H0559 (8800) daily H3117 unto me, Where [is] thy God H0430?
042:011 Why art thou cast down H7817 (8709), O my soul H5315? and why art thou disquieted H1993 (8799) within me? hope H3176 (8685) thou in God H0430: for I shall yet praise H3034 (8686) him, [who is] the health H3444 of my countenance H6440, and my God H0430.
043:001 ¶  Judge H8199 (8798) me, O God H0430, and plead H7378 (8798) my cause H7379 against an ungodly H3808 H2623 nation H1471: O deliver H6403 (8762) me from the deceitful H4820 and unjust H5766 man H0376.
043:002 For thou [art] the God H0430 of my strength H4581: why dost thou cast me off H2186 (8804)? why go H1980 (8691) I mourning H6937 (8802) because of the oppression H3906 of the enemy H0341 (8802)?
043:003 O send out H7971 (8798) thy light H0216 and thy truth H0571: let them lead H5148 (8686) me; let them bring H0935 (8686) me unto thy holy H6944 hill H2022, and to thy tabernacles H4908.
043:004 Then will I go H0935 (8799) unto the altar H4196 of God H0430, unto God H0410 my exceeding H8057 joy H1524: yea, upon the harp H3658 will I praise H3034 (8686) thee, O God H0430 my God H0430.
043:005 Why art thou cast down H7817 (8709), O my soul H5315? and why art thou disquieted H1993 (8799) within me? hope H3176 (8685) in God H0430: for I shall yet praise H3034 (8686) him, [who is] the health H3444 of my countenance H6440, and my God H0430.
044:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141, Maschil H4905 (8688).» We have heard H8085 (8804) with our ears H0241, O God H0430, our fathers H0001 have told H5608 (8765) us, [what] work H6467 thou didst H6466 (8804) in their days H3117, in the times H3117 of old H6924.
044:002 [How] thou didst drive out H3423 (8689) the heathen H1471 with thy hand H3027, and plantedst H5193 (8799) them; [how] thou didst afflict H7489 (8686) the people H3816, and cast them out H7971 (8762).
044:003 For they got H3423 not the land H0776 in possession H3423 (8804) by their own sword H2719, neither did their own arm H2220 save H3467 (8689) them: but thy right hand H3225, and thine arm H2220, and the light H0216 of thy countenance H6440, because thou hadst a favour H7521 (8804) unto them.
044:004 Thou art my King H4428, O God H0430: command H6680 (8761) deliverances H3444 for Jacob H3290.
044:005 Through thee will we push down H5055 (8762) our enemies H6862: through thy name H8034 will we tread them under H0947 (8799) that rise up H6965 (8801) against us.
044:006 For I will not trust H0982 (8799) in my bow H7198, neither shall my sword H2719 save H3467 (8686) me.
044:007 But thou hast saved H3467 (8689) us from our enemies H6862, and hast put them to shame H0954 (8689) that hated H8130 (8764) us.
044:008 In God H0430 we boast H1984 (8765) all the day H3117 long, and praise H3034 (8686) thy name H8034 for ever H5769. Selah H5542.
044:009 But H0637 thou hast cast off H2186 (8804), and put us to shame H3637 (8686); and goest not forth H3318 (8799) with our armies H6635.
044:010 Thou makest us to turn H7725 (8686) back H0268 from the enemy H6862: and they which hate H8130 (8764) us spoil H8154 (8804) for themselves.
044:011 Thou hast given H5414 (8799) us like sheep H6629 [appointed] for meat H3978; and hast scattered H2219 (8765) us among the heathen H1471.
044:012 Thou sellest H4376 (8799) thy people H5971 for nought H1952, and dost not increase H7235 (8765) [thy wealth] by their price H4242.
044:013 Thou makest H7760 (8799) us a reproach H2781 to our neighbours H7934, a scorn H3933 and a derision H7047 to them that are round about H5439 us.
044:014 Thou makest H7760 (8799) us a byword H4912 among the heathen H1471, a shaking H4493 of the head H7218 among the people H3816.
044:015 My confusion H3639 [is] continually H3117 before me, and the shame H1322 of my face H6440 hath covered H3680 (8765) me,
044:016 For the voice H6963 of him that reproacheth H2778 (8764) and blasphemeth H1442 (8764); by reason H6440 of the enemy H0341 (8802) and avenger H5358 (8693).
044:017 All this is come H0935 (8804) upon us; yet have we not forgotten H7911 (8804) thee, neither have we dealt falsely H8266 (8765) in thy covenant H1285.
044:018 Our heart H3820 is not turned H5472 (8738) back H0268, neither have our steps H0838 declined H5186 (8799) from thy way H0734;
044:019 Though thou hast sore broken H1794 (8765) us in the place H4725 of dragons H8577, and covered H3680 (8762) us with the shadow of death H6757.
044:020 If we have forgotten H7911 (8804) the name H8034 of our God H0430, or stretched out H6566 (8799) our hands H3709 to a strange H2114 (8801) god H0410;
044:021 Shall not God H0430 search this out H2713 (8799)? for he knoweth H3045 (8802) the secrets H8587 of the heart H3820.
044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed H2026 (8795) all the day H3117 long; we are counted H2803 (8738) as sheep H6629 for the slaughter H2878.
044:023 Awake H5782 (8798), why sleepest H3462 (8799) thou, O Lord H0136? arise H6974 (8685), cast [us] not off H2186 (8799) for ever H5331.
044:024 Wherefore hidest H5641 (8686) thou thy face H6440, [and] forgettest H7911 (8799) our affliction H6040 and our oppression H3906?
044:025 For our soul H5315 is bowed down H7743 (8804) to the dust H6083: our belly H0990 cleaveth H1692 (8804) unto the earth H0776.
044:026 Arise H6965 (8798) for our help H5833, and redeem H6299 (8798) us for thy mercies H2617 ’ sake.
045:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Shoshannim H7799, for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141, Maschil H4905 (8688), A Song H7892 of loves H3039.» My heart H3820 is inditing H7370 (8804) a good H2896 matter H1697: I speak H0559 (8802) of the things which I have made H4639 touching the king H4428: my tongue H3956 [is] the pen H5842 of a ready H4106 writer H5608 (8802).
045:002 Thou art fairer H3302 (8795) than the children H1121 of men H0120: grace H2580 is poured H3332 (8717) into thy lips H8193: therefore God H0430 hath blessed H1288 (8765) thee for ever H5769.
045:003 Gird H2296 (8798) thy sword H2719 upon [thy] thigh H3409, O [most] mighty H1368, with thy glory H1935 and thy majesty H1926.
045:004 And in thy majesty H1926 ride H7392 (8798) prosperously H6743 (8798) because H1697 of truth H0571 and meekness H6037 [and] righteousness H6664; and thy right hand H3225 shall teach H3384 (8686) thee terrible things H3372 (8737).
045:005 Thine arrows H2671 [are] sharp H8150 (8802) in the heart H3820 of the king’s H4428 enemies H0341 (8802); [whereby] the people H5971 fall H5307 (8799) under thee.
045:006 Thy throne H3678, O God H0430, [is] for ever H5769 and ever H5703: the sceptre H7626 of thy kingdom H4438 [is] a right H4334 sceptre H7626.
045:007 Thou lovest H0157 (8804) righteousness H6664, and hatest H8130 (8799) wickedness H7562: therefore God H0430, thy God H0430, hath anointed H4886 (8804) thee with the oil H8081 of gladness H8342 above thy fellows H2270.
045:008 All thy garments H0899 [smell] of myrrh H4753, and aloes H0174, [and] cassia H7102, out of the ivory H8127 palaces H1964, whereby H4482 they have made thee glad H8055 (8765).
045:009 Kings H4428 ’ daughters H1323 [were] among thy honourable women H3368: upon thy right hand H3225 did stand H5324 (8738) the queen H7694 in gold H3800 of Ophir H0211.
045:010 Hearken H8085 (8798), O daughter H1323, and consider H7200 (8798), and incline H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241; forget H7911 (8798) also thine own people H5971, and thy father’s H0001 house H1004;
045:011 So shall the king H4428 greatly desire H0183 (8691) thy beauty H3308: for he [is] thy Lord H0113; and worship H7812 (8690) thou him.
045:012 And the daughter H1323 of Tyre H6865 [shall be there] with a gift H4503; [even] the rich H6223 among the people H5971 shall intreat H2470 (8762) thy favour H6440.
045:013 The king’s H4428 daughter H1323 [is] all glorious H3520 within H6441: her clothing H3830 [is] of wrought H4865 gold H2091.
045:014 She shall be brought H2986 (8714) unto the king H4428 in raiment of needlework H7553: the virgins H1330 her companions H7464 that follow H0310 her shall be brought H0935 (8716) unto thee.
045:015 With gladness H8057 and rejoicing H1524 shall they be brought H2986 (8714): they shall enter H0935 (8799) into the king’s H4428 palace H1964.
045:016 Instead of thy fathers H0001 shall be thy children H1121, whom thou mayest make H7896 (8799) princes H8269 in all the earth H0776.
045:017 I will make thy name H8034 to be remembered H2142 (8686) in all H1755 generations H1755: therefore shall the people H5971 praise H3034 (8686) thee for ever H5769 and ever H5703.
046:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141, A Song H7892 upon Alamoth H5961.» God H0430 [is] our refuge H4268 and strength H5797, a very H3966 present H4672 (8738) help H5833 in trouble H6869.
046:002 Therefore will not we fear H3372 (8799), though the earth H0776 be removed H4171 (8687), and though the mountains H2022 be carried H4131 (8800) into the midst H3820 of the sea H3220;
046:003 [Though] the waters H4325 thereof roar H1993 (8799) [and] be troubled H2560 (8799), [though] the mountains H2022 shake H7493 (8799) with the swelling H1346 thereof. Selah H5542.
046:004 [There is] a river H5104, the streams H6388 whereof shall make glad H8055 (8762) the city H5892 of God H0430, the holy H6918 [place] of the tabernacles H4908 of the most High H5945.
046:005 God H0430 [is] in the midst H7130 of her; she shall not be moved H4131 (8735): God H0430 shall help H5826 (8799) her, [and that] right H6437 (8800) early H1242.
046:006 The heathen H1471 raged H1993 (8804), the kingdoms H4467 were moved H4131 (8804): he uttered H5414 (8804) his voice H6963, the earth H0776 melted H4127 (8799).
046:007 The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] with us; the God H0430 of Jacob H3290 [is] our refuge H4869. Selah H5542.
046:008 Come H3212 (8798), behold H2372 (8798) the works H4659 of the LORD H3068, what desolations H8047 he hath made H7760 (8804) in the earth H0776.
046:009 He maketh wars H4421 to cease H7673 (8688) unto the end H7097 of the earth H0776; he breaketh H7665 (8762) the bow H7198, and cutteth H7112 the spear H2595 in sunder H7112 (8765); he burneth H8313 (8799) the chariot H5699 in the fire H0784.
046:010 Be still H7503 (8685), and know H3045 (8798) that I [am] God H0430: I will be exalted H7311 (8799) among the heathen H1471, I will be exalted H7311 (8799) in the earth H0776.
046:011 The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] with us; the God H0430 of Jacob H3290 [is] our refuge H4869. Selah H5542.
047:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141.» O clap H8628 (8798) your hands H3709, all ye people H5971; shout H7321 (8685) unto God H0430 with the voice H6963 of triumph H7440.
047:002 For the LORD H3068 most high H5945 [is] terrible H3372 (8737); [he is] a great H1419 King H4428 over all the earth H0776.
047:003 He shall subdue H1696 (8686) the people H5971 under us, and the nations H3816 under our feet H7272.
047:004 He shall choose H0977 (8799) our inheritance H5159 for us, the excellency H1347 of Jacob H3290 whom he loved H0157 (8804). Selah H5542.
047:005 God H0430 is gone up H5927 (8804) with a shout H8643, the LORD H3068 with the sound H6963 of a trumpet H7782.
047:006 Sing praises H2167 (8761) to God H0430, sing praises H2167 (8761): sing praises H2167 (8761) unto our King H4428, sing praises H2167 (8761).
047:007 For God H0430 [is] the King H4428 of all the earth H0776: sing ye praises H2167 (8761) with understanding H7919 (8688).
047:008 God H0430 reigneth H4427 (8804) over the heathen H1471: God H0430 sitteth H3427 (8804) upon the throne H3678 of his holiness H6944.
047:009 The princes H5081 of the people H5971 are gathered together H0622 (8738), [even] the people H5971 of the God H0430 of Abraham H0085: for the shields H4043 of the earth H0776 [belong] unto God H0430: he is greatly H3966 exalted H5927 (8738).
048:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 [and] Psalm H4210 for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141.» Great H1419 [is] the LORD H3068, and greatly H3966 to be praised H1984 (8794) in the city H5892 of our God H0430, [in] the mountain H2022 of his holiness H6944.
048:002 Beautiful H3303 for situation H5131, the joy H4885 of the whole earth H0776, [is] mount H2022 Zion H6726, [on] the sides H3411 of the north H6828, the city H7151 of the great H7227 King H4428.
048:003 God H0430 is known H3045 (8738) in her palaces H0759 for a refuge H4869.
048:004 For, lo, the kings H4428 were assembled H3259 (8738), they passed by H5674 (8804) together H3162.
048:005 They saw H7200 (8804) [it, and] so they marvelled H8539 (8804); they were troubled H0926 (8738), [and] hasted away H2648 (8738).
048:006 Fear H7461 took hold H0270 (8804) upon them there, [and] pain H2427, as of a woman in travail H3205 (8802).
048:007 Thou breakest H7665 (8762) the ships H0591 of Tarshish H8659 with an east H6921 wind H7307.
048:008 As we have heard H8085 (8804), so have we seen H7200 (8804) in the city H5892 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, in the city H5892 of our God H0430: God H0430 will establish H3559 (8787) it for H5704 ever H5769. Selah H5542.
048:009 We have thought H1819 (8765) of thy lovingkindness H2617, O God H0430, in the midst H7130 of thy temple H1964.
048:010 According to thy name H8034, O God H0430, so [is] thy praise H8416 unto the ends H7099 of the earth H0776: thy right hand H3225 is full H4390 (8804) of righteousness H6664.
048:011 Let mount H2022 Zion H6726 rejoice H8055 (8799), let the daughters H1323 of Judah H3063 be glad H1523 (8799), because of thy judgments H4941.
048:012 Walk about H5437 (8798) Zion H6726, and go round about H5362 (8685) her: tell H5608 (8798) the towers H4026 thereof.
048:013 Mark H7896 (8798) ye well H3820 her bulwarks H2430, consider H6448 (8761) her palaces H0759; that ye may tell H5608 (8762) [it] to the generation H1755 following H0314.
048:014 For this God H0430 [is] our God H0430 for ever H5769 and ever H5703: he will be our guide H5090 (8762) [even] unto death H4192.
049:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141.» Hear H8085 (8798) this, all [ye] people H5971; give ear H0238 (8685), all [ye] inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the world H2465:
049:002 Both low H1121 H0120 and high H1121 H0376, rich H6223 and poor H0034, together H3162.
049:003 My mouth H6310 shall speak H1696 (8762) of wisdom H2454; and the meditation H1900 of my heart H3820 [shall be] of understanding H8394.
049:004 I will incline H5186 (8686) mine ear H0241 to a parable H4912: I will open H6605 (8799) my dark saying H2420 upon the harp H3658.
049:005 Wherefore should I fear H3372 (8799) in the days H3117 of evil H7451, [when] the iniquity H5771 of my heels H6120 shall compass H5437 (8799) me about?
049:006 They that trust H0982 (8802) in their wealth H2428, and boast H1984 (8691) themselves in the multitude H7230 of their riches H6239;
049:007 None [of them] can H0376 by any means H6299 (8800) redeem H6299 (8799) his brother H0251, nor give H5414 (8799) to God H0430 a ransom H3724 for him:
049:008 (For the redemption H6306 of their soul H5315 [is] precious H3365 (8799), and it ceaseth H2308 (8804) for ever H5769:)
049:009 That he should still live H2421 (8799) for ever H5331, [and] not see H7200 (8799) corruption H7845.
049:010 For he seeth H7200 (8799) [that] wise men H2450 die H4191 (8799), likewise H3162 the fool H3684 and the brutish person H1198 perish H0006 (8799), and leave H5800 (8804) their wealth H2428 to others H0312.
049:011 Their inward H7130 thought [is, that] their houses H1004 [shall continue] for ever H5769, [and] their dwelling H4908 places to all H1755 generations H1755; they call H7121 (8804) [their] lands H0127 after their own names H8034.
049:012 Nevertheless man H0120 [being] in honour H3366 abideth H3885 (8799) not: he is like H4911 (8738) the beasts H0929 [that] perish H1820 (8738).
049:013 This their way H1870 [is] their folly H3689: yet their posterity H0310 approve H7521 (8799) their sayings H6310. Selah H5542.
049:014 Like sheep H6629 they are laid H8371 (8804) in the grave H7585; death H4194 shall feed H7462 (8799) on them; and the upright H3477 shall have dominion H7287 (8799) over them in the morning H1242; and their beauty H6697 (8675) H6736 shall consume H1086 (8763) in the grave H7585 from their dwelling H2073.
049:015 But God H0430 will redeem H6299 (8799) my soul H5315 from the power H3027 of the grave H7585: for he shall receive H3947 (8799) me. Selah H5542.
049:016 Be not thou afraid H3372 (8799) when one H0376 is made rich H6238 (8686), when the glory H3519 of his house H1004 is increased H7235 (8799);
049:017 For when he dieth H4194 he shall carry nothing away H3947 (8799): his glory H3519 shall not descend H3381 (8799) after H0310 him.
049:018 Though while he lived H2416 he blessed H1288 (8762) his soul H5315: and [men] will praise H3034 (8686) thee, when thou doest well H3190 (8686) to thyself.
049:019 He shall go H0935 (8799) to the generation H1755 of his fathers H0001; they shall never H3808 H5331 see H7200 (8799) light H0216.
049:020 Man H0120 [that is] in honour H3366, and understandeth H0995 (8799) not, is like H4911 (8738) the beasts H0929 [that] perish H1820 (8738).
050:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of Asaph H0623.» The mighty H0410 God H0430, [even] the LORD H3068, hath spoken H1696 (8765), and called H7121 (8799) the earth H0776 from the rising H4217 of the sun H8121 unto the going down H3996 thereof.
050:002 Out of Zion H6726, the perfection H4359 of beauty H3308, God H0430 hath shined H3313 (8689).
050:003 Our God H0430 shall come H0935 (8799), and shall not keep silence H2790 (8799): a fire H0784 shall devour H0398 (8799) before H6440 him, and it shall be very H3966 tempestuous H8175 (8738) round about H5439 him.
050:004 He shall call H7121 (8799) to the heavens H8064 from above H5920, and to the earth H0776, that he may judge H1777 (8800) his people H5971.
050:005 Gather H0622 (8798) my saints H2623 together unto me; those that have made H3772 (8802) a covenant H1285 with me by sacrifice H2077.
050:006 And the heavens H8064 shall declare H5046 (8686) his righteousness H6664: for God H0430 [is] judge H8199 (8802) himself. Selah H5542.
050:007 Hear H8085 (8798), O my people H5971, and I will speak H1696 (8762); O Israel H3478, and I will testify H5749 (8686) against thee: I [am] God H0430, [even] thy God H0430.
050:008 I will not reprove H3198 (8686) thee for thy sacrifices H2077 or thy burnt offerings H5930, [to have been] continually H8548 before me.
050:009 I will take H3947 (8799) no bullock H6499 out of thy house H1004, [nor] he goats H6260 out of thy folds H4356.
050:010 For every beast H2416 of the forest H3293 [is] mine, [and] the cattle H0929 upon a thousand H0505 hills H2042.
050:011 I know H3045 (8804) all the fowls H5775 of the mountains H2022: and the wild beasts H2123 of the field H7704 [are] mine H5978.
050:012 If I were hungry H7456 (8799), I would not tell H0559 (8799) thee: for the world H8398 [is] mine, and the fulness H4393 thereof.
050:013 Will I eat H0398 (8799) the flesh H1320 of bulls H0047, or drink H8354 (8799) the blood H1818 of goats H6260?
050:014 Offer H2076 (8798) unto God H0430 thanksgiving H8426; and pay H7999 (8761) thy vows H5088 unto the most High H5945:
050:015 And call H7121 (8798) upon me in the day H3117 of trouble H6869: I will deliver H2502 (8762) thee, and thou shalt glorify H3513 (8762) me.
050:016 But unto the wicked H7563 God H0430 saith H0559 (8804), What hast thou to do to declare H5608 (8763) my statutes H2706, or [that] thou shouldest take H5375 (8799) my covenant H1285 in thy mouth H6310?
050:017 Seeing thou hatest H8130 (8804) instruction H4148, and castest H7993 (8686) my words H1697 behind H0310 thee.
050:018 When thou sawest H7200 (8804) a thief H1590, then thou consentedst H7521 (8799) with him, and hast been partaker H2506 with adulterers H5003 (8764).
050:019 Thou givest H7971 (8804) thy mouth H6310 to evil H7451, and thy tongue H3956 frameth H6775 (8686) deceit H4820.
050:020 Thou sittest H3427 (8799) [and] speakest H1696 (8762) against thy brother H0251; thou H5414 (8799) slanderest H1848 thine own mother’s H0517 son H1121.
050:021 These [things] hast thou done H6213 (8804), and I kept silence H2790 (8689); thou thoughtest H1819 (8765) that I was altogether H1961 (8800) [such an one] as thyself: [but] I will reprove H3198 (8686) thee, and set [them] in order H6186 (8799) before thine eyes H5869.
050:022 Now consider H0995 (8798) this, ye that forget H7911 (8802) God H0433, lest I tear [you] in pieces H2963 (8799), and [there be] none to deliver H5337 (8688).
050:023 Whoso offereth H2076 (8802) praise H8426 glorifieth H3513 (8762) me: and to him that ordereth H7760 (8804) [his] conversation H1870 [aright] will I shew H7200 (8686) the salvation H3468 of God H0430.
051:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732, when Nathan H5416 the prophet H5030 came H0935 (8800) unto him, after he had gone in H0935 (8804) to Bathsheba H1339.» Have mercy H2603 (8798) upon me, O God H0430, according to thy lovingkindness H2617: according unto the multitude H7230 of thy tender mercies H7356 blot out H4229 (8798) my transgressions H6588.
051:002 Wash H3526 (8761) me throughly H7235 (8685) from mine iniquity H5771, and cleanse H2891 (8761) me from my sin H2403.
051:003 For I acknowledge H3045 (8799) my transgressions H6588: and my sin H2403 [is] ever H8548 before me.
051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned H2398 (8804), and done H6213 (8804) [this] evil H7451 in thy sight H5869: that thou mightest be justified H6663 (8799) when thou speakest H1696 (8800), [and] be clear H2135 (8799) when thou judgest H8199 (8800).
051:005 Behold, I was shapen H2342 (8797) in iniquity H5771; and in sin H2399 did my mother H0517 conceive H3179 (8765) me.
051:006 Behold, thou desirest H2654 (8804) truth H0571 in the inward parts H2910: and in the hidden H5640 (8803) [part] thou shalt make me to know H3045 (8686) wisdom H2451.
051:007 Purge H2398 (8762) me with hyssop H0231, and I shall be clean H2891 (8799): wash H3526 (8762) me, and I shall be whiter H3835 (8686) than snow H7950.
051:008 Make me to hear H8085 (8686) joy H8342 and gladness H8057; [that] the bones H6106 [which] thou hast broken H1794 (8765) may rejoice H1523 (8799).
051:009 Hide H5641 (8685) thy face H6440 from my sins H2399, and blot out H4229 (8798) all mine iniquities H5771.
051:010 Create H1254 (8798) in me a clean H2889 heart H3820, O God H0430; and renew H2318 (8761) a right H3559 (8737) spirit H7307 within H7130 me.
051:011 Cast me not away H7993 (8686) from thy presence H6440; and take H3947 (8799) not thy holy H6944 spirit H7307 from me.
051:012 Restore H7725 (8685) unto me the joy H8342 of thy salvation H3468; and uphold H5564 (8799) me [with thy] free H5081 spirit H7307.
051:013 [Then] will I teach H3925 (8762) transgressors H6586 (8802) thy ways H1870; and sinners H2400 shall be converted H7725 (8799) unto thee.
051:014 Deliver H5337 (8685) me from bloodguiltiness H1818, O God H0430, thou God H0430 of my salvation H8668: [and] my tongue H3956 shall sing aloud H7442 (8762) of thy righteousness H6666.
051:015 O Lord H0136, open H6605 (8799) thou my lips H8193; and my mouth H6310 shall shew forth H5046 (8686) thy praise H8416.
051:016 For thou desirest H2654 (8799) not sacrifice H2077; else would I give H5414 (8799) [it]: thou delightest H7521 (8799) not in burnt offering H5930.
051:017 The sacrifices H2077 of God H0430 [are] a broken H7665 (8737) spirit H7307: a broken H7665 (8737) and a contrite H1794 (8737) heart H3820, O God H0430, thou wilt not despise H0959 (8799).
051:018 Do good H3190 (8685) in thy good pleasure H7522 unto Zion H6726: build H1129 (8799) thou the walls H2346 of Jerusalem H3389.
051:019 Then shalt thou be pleased H2654 (8799) with the sacrifices H2077 of righteousness H6664, with burnt offering H5930 and whole H3632 burnt offering H5930: then shall they offer H5927 (8686) bullocks H6499 upon thine altar H4196.
052:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), Maschil H4905 (8688), [A Psalm] of David H1732, when Doeg H1673 the Edomite H0130 came H0935 (8800) and told H5046 (8686) Saul H7586, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, David H1732 is come H0935 (8804) to the house H1004 of Ahimelech H0288.» Why boastest H1984 (8691) thou thyself in mischief H7451, O mighty H1368 man? the goodness H2617 of God H0410 [endureth] continually H3117.
052:002 Thy tongue H3956 deviseth H2803 (8799) mischiefs H1942; like a sharp H3913 (8794) razor H8593, working H6213 (8802) deceitfully H7423.
052:003 Thou lovest H0157 (8804) evil H7451 more than good H2896; [and] lying H8267 rather than to speak H1696 (8763) righteousness H6664. Selah H5542.
052:004 Thou lovest H0157 (8804) all devouring H1105 words H1697, O [thou] deceitful H4820 tongue H3956.
052:005 God H0410 shall likewise destroy H5422 (8799) thee for ever H5331, he shall take thee away H2846 (8799), and pluck thee out H5255 (8799) of [thy] dwelling place H0168, and root thee out H8327 (8765) of the land H0776 of the living H2416. Selah H5542.
052:006 The righteous H6662 also shall see H7200 (8799), and fear H3372 (8799), and shall laugh H7832 (8799) at him:
052:007 Lo, [this is] the man H1397 [that] made H7760 (8799) not God H0430 his strength H4581; but trusted H0982 (8799) in the abundance H7230 of his riches H6239, [and] strengthened H5810 (8799) himself in his wickedness H1942.
052:008 But I [am] like a green H7488 olive tree H2132 in the house H1004 of God H0430: I trust H0982 (8804) in the mercy H2617 of God H0430 for ever H5769 and ever H5703.
052:009 I will praise H3034 (8686) thee for ever H5769, because thou hast done H6213 (8804) [it]: and I will wait H6960 (8762) on thy name H8034; for [it is] good H2896 before thy saints H2623.
053:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Mahalath H4257, Maschil H4905 (8688), [A Psalm] of David H1732.» The fool H5036 hath said H0559 (8804) in his heart H3820, [There is] no God H0430. Corrupt H7843 (8689) are they, and have done abominable H8581 (8689) iniquity H5766: [there is] none that doeth H6213 (8802) good H2896.
053:002 God H0430 looked down H8259 (8689) from heaven H8064 upon the children H1121 of men H0120, to see H7200 (8800) if there were H3426 [any] that did understand H7919 (8688), that did seek H1875 (8802) God H0430.
053:003 Every one of them is gone back H5472 (8804): they are altogether H3162 become filthy H0444 (8738); [there is] none that doeth H6213 (8802) good H2896, no, not one H0259.
053:004 Have the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205 no knowledge H3045 (8804)? who eat up H0398 (8802) my people H5971 [as] they eat H0398 (8804) bread H3899: they have not called H7121 (8804) upon God H0430.
053:005 There were they in great H6343 fear H6342 (8804), [where] no fear H6343 was: for God H0430 hath scattered H6340 (8765) the bones H6106 of him that encampeth H2583 (8802) [against] thee: thou hast put [them] to shame H0954 (8689), because God H0430 hath despised H3988 (8804) them.
053:006 Oh that H5414 (8799) the salvation H3444 of Israel H3478 [were come] out of Zion H6726! When God H0430 bringeth back H7725 (8800) the captivity H7622 of his people H5971, Jacob H3290 shall rejoice H1523 (8799), [and] Israel H3478 shall be glad H8055 (8799).
054:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) on Neginoth H5058, Maschil H4905 (8688), [A Psalm] of David H1732, when the Ziphims H2130 came H0935 (8800) and said H0559 (8799) to Saul H7586, Doth not David H1732 hide H5641 (8693) himself with us?» Save H3467 (8685) me, O God H0430, by thy name H8034, and judge H1777 (8799) me by thy strength H1369.
054:002 Hear H8085 (8798) my prayer H8605, O God H0430; give ear H0238 (8685) to the words H0561 of my mouth H6310.
054:003 For strangers H2114 (8801) are risen up H6965 (8804) against me, and oppressors H6184 seek H1245 (8765) after my soul H5315: they have not set H7760 (8804) God H0430 before them. Selah H5542.
054:004 Behold, God H0430 [is] mine helper H5826 (8802): the Lord H0136 [is] with them that uphold H5564 (8802) my soul H5315.
054:005 He shall reward H7725 (8686) (8675) H7725 (8799) evil H7451 unto mine enemies H8324 (8802): cut them off H6789 (8685) in thy truth H0571.
054:006 I will freely H5071 sacrifice H2076 (8799) unto thee: I will praise H3034 (8686) thy name H8034, O LORD H3068; for [it is] good H2896.
054:007 For he hath delivered H5337 (8689) me out of all trouble H6869: and mine eye H5869 hath seen H7200 (8804) [his desire] upon mine enemies H0341 (8802).
055:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) on Neginoth H5058, Maschil H4905 (8688), [A Psalm] of David H1732.» Give ear H0238 (8685) to my prayer H8605, O God H0430; and hide H5956 (8691) not thyself from my supplication H8467.
055:002 Attend H7181 (8685) unto me, and hear H6030 (8798) me: I mourn H7300 (8686) in my complaint H7879, and make a noise H1949 (8686);
055:003 Because of the voice H6963 of the enemy H0341 (8802), because H6440 of the oppression H6125 of the wicked H7563: for they cast H4131 (8686) iniquity H0205 upon me, and in wrath H0639 they hate H7852 (8799) me.
055:004 My heart H3820 is sore pained H2342 (8799) within H7130 me: and the terrors H0367 of death H4194 are fallen H5307 (8804) upon me.
055:005 Fearfulness H3374 and trembling H7461 are come H0935 (8799) upon me, and horror H6427 hath overwhelmed H3680 (8762) me.
055:006 And I said H0559 (8799), Oh that H5414 (8799) I had wings H0083 like a dove H3123! [for then] would I fly away H5774 (8799), and be at rest H7931 (8799).
055:007 Lo, [then] would I wander H5074 (8800) far off H7368 (8686), [and] remain H3885 (8799) in the wilderness H4057. Selah H5542.
055:008 I would hasten H2363 (8686) my escape H4655 from the windy H7307 storm H5584 (8801) [and] tempest H5591.
055:009 Destroy H1104 (8761), O Lord H0136, [and] divide H6385 (8761) their tongues H3956: for I have seen H7200 (8804) violence H2555 and strife H7379 in the city H5892.
055:010 Day H3119 and night H3915 they go about H5437 (8779) it upon the walls H2346 thereof: mischief H0205 also and sorrow H5999 [are] in the midst H7130 of it.
055:011 Wickedness H1942 [is] in the midst H7130 thereof: deceit H8496 and guile H4820 depart H4185 (8686) not from her streets H7339.
055:012 For [it was] not an enemy H0341 (8802) [that] reproached H2778 (8762) me; then I could have borne H5375 (8799) [it]: neither [was it] he that hated H8130 (8764) me [that] did magnify H1431 (8689) [himself] against me; then I would have hid H5641 (8735) myself from him:
055:013 But [it was] thou, a man H0582 mine equal H6187, my guide H0441, and mine acquaintance H3045 (8794).
055:014 We took sweet H4985 (8686) counsel H5475 together H3162, [and] walked H1980 (8762) unto the house H1004 of God H0430 in company H7285.
055:015 Let death H4194 seize H5377 (8686) (8675) H3451 upon them, [and] let them go down H3381 (8799) quick H2416 into hell H7585: for wickedness H7451 [is] in their dwellings H4033, [and] among H7130 them.
055:016 As for me, I will call H7121 (8799) upon God H0430; and the LORD H3068 shall save H3467 (8686) me.
055:017 Evening H6153, and morning H1242, and at noon H6672, will I pray H7878 (8799), and cry aloud H1993 (8799): and he shall hear H8085 (8799) my voice H6963.
055:018 He hath delivered H6299 (8804) my soul H5315 in peace H7965 from the battle H7128 [that was] against me: for there were many H7227 with me.
055:019 God H0410 shall hear H8085 (8799), and afflict H6030 (8799) them, even he that abideth H3427 (8802) of old H6924. Selah H5542. Because they have no changes H2487, therefore they fear H3372 (8804) not God H0430.
055:020 He hath put forth H7971 (8804) his hands H3027 against such as be at peace H7965 with him: he hath broken H2490 (8765) his covenant H1285.
055:021 [The words] of his mouth H6310 were smoother H2505 (8804) than butter H4260, but war H7128 [was] in his heart H3820: his words H1697 were softer H7401 (8804) than oil H8081, yet [were] they drawn swords H6609.
055:022 Cast H7993 (8685) thy burden H3053 upon the LORD H3068, and he shall sustain H3557 (8770) thee: he shall never H5769 suffer H5414 (8799) the righteous H6662 to be moved H4131 (8800).
055:023 But thou, O God H0430, shalt bring them down H3381 (8686) into the pit H0875 of destruction H7845: bloody H1818 and deceitful H4820 men H0582 shall not live out half H2673 (8799) their days H3117; but I will trust H0982 (8799) in thee.
056:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Jonathelemrechokim H3128, Michtam H4387 of David H1732, when the Philistines H6430 took H0270 (8800) him in Gath H1661.» Be merciful H2603 (8798) unto me, O God H0430: for man H0582 would swallow me up H7602 (8804); he fighting H3898 (8802) daily H3117 oppresseth H3905 (8799) me.
056:002 Mine enemies H8324 (8802) would daily H3117 swallow H7602 (8804) [me] up: for [they be] many H7227 that fight H3898 (8802) against me, O thou most High H4791.
056:003 What time H3117 I am afraid H3372 (8799), I will trust H0982 (8799) in thee.
056:004 In God H0430 I will praise H1984 (8762) his word H1697, in God H0430 I have put my trust H0982 (8804); I will not fear H3372 (8799) what flesh H1320 can do H6213 (8799) unto me.
056:005 Every day H3117 they wrest H6087 (8762) my words H1697: all their thoughts H4284 [are] against me for evil H7451.
056:006 They gather themselves together H1481 (8799), they hide H6845 (8799) (8675) H6845 (8686) themselves, they mark H8104 (8799) my steps H6119, when they wait H6960 (8765) for my soul H5315.
056:007 Shall they escape H6405 by iniquity H0205? in [thine] anger H0639 cast down H3381 (8685) the people H5971, O God H0430.
056:008 Thou tellest H5608 (8804) my wanderings H5112: put H7760 (8798) thou my tears H1832 into thy bottle H4997: [are they] not in thy book H5612?
056:009 When H3117 I cry H7121 (8799) [unto thee], then shall mine enemies H0341 (8802) turn H7725 (8799) back H0268: this I know H3045 (8804); for God H0430 [is] for me.
056:010 In God H0430 will I praise H1984 (8762) [his] word H1697: in the LORD H3068 will I praise H1984 (8762) [his] word H1697.
056:011 In God H0430 have I put my trust H0982 (8804): I will not be afraid H3372 (8799) what man H0120 can do H6213 (8799) unto me.
056:012 Thy vows H5088 [are] upon me, O God H0430: I will render H7999 (8762) praises H8426 unto thee.
056:013 For thou hast delivered H5337 (8689) my soul H5315 from death H4194: [wilt] not [thou deliver] my feet H7272 from falling H1762, that I may walk H1980 (8692) before H6440 God H0430 in the light H0216 of the living H2416?

057:002 I will cry H7121 (8799) unto God H0430 most high H5945; unto God H0410 that performeth H1584 (8802) [all things] for me.
057:003 He shall send H7971 (8799) from heaven H8064, and save H3467 (8686) me [from] the reproach H2778 (8765) of him that would swallow me up H7602 (8802). Selah H5542. God H0430 shall send forth H7971 (8799) his mercy H2617 and his truth H0571.

057:005 Be thou exalted H7311 (8798), O God H0430, above the heavens H8064; [let] thy glory H3519 [be] above all the earth H0776.
057:006 They have prepared H3559 (8689) a net H7568 for my steps H6471; my soul H5315 is bowed down H3721 (8804): they have digged H3738 (8804) a pit H7882 before H6440 me, into the midst H8432 whereof they are fallen H5307 (8804) [themselves]. Selah H5542.
057:007 My heart H3820 is fixed H3559 (8737), O God H0430, my heart H3820 is fixed H3559 (8737): I will sing H7891 (8799) and give praise H2167 (8762).
057:008 Awake up H5782 (8798), my glory H3519; awake H5782 (8798), psaltery H5035 and harp H3658: I [myself] will awake H5782 (8686) early H7837.
057:009 I will praise H3034 (8686) thee, O Lord H0136, among the people H5971: I will sing H2167 (8762) unto thee among the nations H3816.
057:010 For thy mercy H2617 [is] great H1419 unto the heavens H8064, and thy truth H0571 unto the clouds H7834.

058:002 Yea, in heart H3820 ye work H6466 (8799) wickedness H5766; ye weigh H6424 (8762) the violence H2555 of your hands H3027 in the earth H0776.
058:003 The wicked H7563 are estranged H2114 (8804) from the womb H7358: they go astray H8582 (8804) as soon as they be born H0990, speaking H1696 (8802) lies H3577.
058:004 Their poison H2534 [is] like H1823 the poison H2534 of a serpent H5175: [they are] like the deaf H2795 adder H6620 [that] stoppeth H0331 (8686) her ear H0241;
058:005 Which will not hearken H8085 (8799) to the voice H6963 of charmers H3907 (8764), charming H2266 (8802) H2267 never so wisely H2449 (8794).
058:006 Break H2040 (8798) their teeth H8127, O God H0430, in their mouth H6310: break out H5422 (8800) the great teeth H4459 of the young lions H3715, O LORD H3068.
058:007 Let them melt away H3988 (8735) as waters H4325 [which] run continually H1980 (8691): [when] he bendeth H1869 (8799) [his bow to shoot] his arrows H2671, let them be as cut in pieces H4135 (8709).
058:008 As a snail H7642 [which] melteth H8557, let [every one of them] pass away H1980 (8799): [like] the untimely birth H5309 of a woman H0802, [that] they may not see H2372 (8804) the sun H8121.
058:009 Before your pots H5518 can feel H0995 (8799) the thorns H0329, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind H8175 (8799), both living H2416, and in [his] wrath H2740.
058:010 The righteous H6662 shall rejoice H8055 (8799) when he seeth H2372 (8804) the vengeance H5359: he shall wash H7364 (8799) his feet H6471 in the blood H1818 of the wicked H7563.
058:011 So that a man H0120 shall say H0559 (8799), Verily [there is] a reward H6529 for the righteous H6662: verily he is H3426 a God H0430 that judgeth H8199 (8802) in the earth H0776.
059:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), Altaschith H0516 (8686), Michtam H4387 of David H1732; when Saul H7586 sent H7971 (8800), and they watched H8104 (8799) the house H1004 to kill him H4191 (8687).» Deliver H5337 (8685) me from mine enemies H0341 (8802), O my God H0430: defend H7682 (8762) me from them that rise up H6965 (8693) against me.
059:002 Deliver H5337 (8685) me from the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205, and save H3467 (8685) me from bloody H1818 men H0582.
059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait H0693 (8804) for my soul H5315: the mighty H5794 are gathered H1481 (8799) against me; not [for] my transgression H6588, nor [for] my sin H2403, O LORD H3068.
059:004 They run H7323 (8799) and prepare H3559 (8709) themselves without [my] fault H5771: awake H5782 (8798) to help H7125 (8800) me, and behold H7200 (8798).
059:005 Thou therefore, O LORD H3068 God H0430 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, awake H6974 (8685) to visit H6485 (8800) all the heathen H1471: be not merciful H2603 (8799) to any wicked H0205 transgressors H0898 (8802). Selah H5542.
059:006 They return H7725 (8799) at evening H6153: they make a noise H1993 (8799) like a dog H3611, and go round about H5437 (8779) the city H5892.
059:007 Behold, they belch out H5042 (8686) with their mouth H6310: swords H2719 [are] in their lips H8193: for who, [say they], doth hear H8085 (8802)?
059:008 But thou, O LORD H3068, shalt laugh H7832 (8799) at them; thou shalt have all the heathen H1471 in derision H3932 (8799).
059:009 [Because of] his strength H5797 will I wait H8104 (8799) upon thee: for God H0430 [is] my defence H4869.
059:010 The God H0430 of my mercy H2617 shall prevent H6923 (8762) me: God H0430 shall let me see H7200 (8686) [my desire] upon mine enemies H8324 (8802).
059:011 Slay H2026 (8799) them not, lest my people H5971 forget H7911 (8799): scatter H5128 (8685) them by thy power H2428; and bring them down H3381 (8685), O Lord H0136 our shield H4043.
059:012 [For] the sin H2403 of their mouth H6310 [and] the words H1697 of their lips H8193 let them even be taken H3920 (8735) in their pride H1347: and for cursing H0423 and lying H3585 [which] they speak H5608 (8762).
059:013 Consume H3615 (8761) [them] in wrath H2534, consume H3615 (8761) [them], that they [may] not [be]: and let them know H3045 (8799) that God H0430 ruleth H4910 (8802) in Jacob H3290 unto the ends H0657 of the earth H0776. Selah H5542.
059:014 And at evening H6153 let them return H7725 (8799); [and] let them make a noise H1993 (8799) like a dog H3611, and go round about H5437 (8779) the city H5892.
059:015 Let them wander up and down H5128 (8686) (8675) H5128 (8799) for meat H0398 (8800), and grudge H3885 (8799) if they be not satisfied H7646 (8799).
059:016 But I will sing H7891 (8799) of thy power H5797; yea, I will sing aloud H7442 (8762) of thy mercy H2617 in the morning H1242: for thou hast been my defence H4869 and refuge H4498 in the day H3117 of my trouble H6862.
059:017 Unto thee, O my strength H5797, will I sing H2167 (8762): for God H0430 [is] my defence H4869, [and] the God H0430 of my mercy H2617.
060:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Shushaneduth H7802, Michtam H4387 of David H1732, to teach H3925 (8763); when he strove H5327 (8687) with Aramnaharaim H0763 H5104 and with Aramzobah H0760, when Joab H3097 returned H7725 (8799), and smote H5221 (8686) of Edom H0123 in the valley H1516 of salt H4417 twelve H8147 H6240 thousand H0505.» O God H0430, thou hast cast us off H2186 (8804), thou hast scattered H6555 (8804) us, thou hast been displeased H0599 (8804); O turn thyself to us again H7725 (8787).
060:002 Thou hast made the earth H0776 to tremble H7493 (8689); thou hast broken H6480 (8804) it: heal H7495 (8798) the breaches H7667 thereof; for it shaketh H4131 (8804).
060:003 Thou hast shewed H7200 (8689) thy people H5971 hard things H7186: thou hast made us to drink H8248 (8689) the wine H3196 of astonishment H8653.
060:004 Thou hast given H5414 (8804) a banner H5251 to them that fear H3373 thee, that it may be displayed H5127 (8710) because H6440 of the truth H7189. Selah H5542.
060:005 That thy beloved H3039 may be delivered H2502 (8735); save H3467 (8685) [with] thy right hand H3225, and hear H6030 (8798) me.
060:006 God H0430 hath spoken H1696 (8765) in his holiness H6944; I will rejoice H5937 (8799), I will divide H2505 (8762) Shechem H7927, and mete out H4058 (8762) the valley H6010 of Succoth H5523.
060:007 Gilead H1568 [is] mine, and Manasseh H4519 [is] mine; Ephraim H0669 also [is] the strength H4581 of mine head H7218; Judah H3063 [is] my lawgiver H2710 (8781);
060:008 Moab H4124 [is] my washpot H5518 H7366; over Edom H0123 will I cast out H7993 (8686) my shoe H5275: Philistia H6429, triumph H7321 (8708) thou because of me.
060:009 Who will bring H2986 (8686) me [into] the strong H4692 city H5892? who will lead H5148 (8804) me into Edom H0123?
060:010 [Wilt] not thou, O God H0430, [which] hadst cast us off H2186 (8804)? and [thou], O God H0430, [which] didst not go out H3318 (8799) with our armies H6635?
060:011 Give H3051 (8798) us help H5833 from trouble H6862: for vain H7723 [is] the help H8668 of man H0120.
060:012 Through God H0430 we shall do H6213 (8799) valiantly H2428: for he [it is that] shall tread down H0947 (8799) our enemies H6862.
061:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Neginah H5058, [A Psalm] of David H1732.» Hear H8085 (8798) my cry H7440, O God H0430; attend H7181 (8685) unto my prayer H8605.
061:002 From the end H7097 of the earth H0776 will I cry H7121 (8799) unto thee, when my heart H3820 is overwhelmed H5848 (8800): lead H5148 (8686) me to the rock H6697 [that] is higher H7311 (8799) than I.
061:003 For thou hast been a shelter H4268 for me, [and] a strong H5797 tower H4026 from H6440 the enemy H0341 (8802).
061:004 I will abide H1481 (8799) in thy tabernacle H0168 for ever H5769: I will trust H2620 (8799) in the covert H5643 of thy wings H3671. Selah H5542.
061:005 For thou, O God H0430, hast heard H8085 (8804) my vows H5088: thou hast given H5414 (8804) [me] the heritage H3425 of those that fear H3373 thy name H8034.
061:006 Thou wilt prolong H3254 (8686) the king’s H4428 life H3117 H3117: [and] his years H8141 as many H1755 generations H1755.
061:007 He shall abide H3427 (8799) before H6440 God H0430 for ever H5769: O prepare H4487 (8761) mercy H2617 and truth H0571, [which] may preserve H5341 (8799) him.
061:008 So will I sing H2167 (8762) praise unto thy name H8034 for ever H5703, that I may daily H3117 H3117 perform H7999 (8763) my vows H5088.
062:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), to Jeduthun H3038, A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Truly my soul H5315 waiteth H1747 upon God H0430: from him [cometh] my salvation H3444.
062:002 He only [is] my rock H6697 and my salvation H3444; [he is] my defence H4869; I shall not be greatly H7227 moved H4131 (8735).
062:003 How long will ye imagine mischief H2050 (8779) against a man H0376? ye shall be slain H7523 (8792) all of you: as a bowing H5186 (8803) wall H7023 [shall ye be, and as] a tottering H1760 (8803) fence H1447.
062:004 They only consult H3289 (8804) to cast [him] down H5080 (8687) from his excellency H7613: they delight H7521 (8799) in lies H3577: they bless H1288 (8762) with their mouth H6310, but they curse H7043 (8762) inwardly H7130. Selah H5542.
062:005 My soul H5315, wait H1826 (8798) thou only upon God H0430; for my expectation H8615 [is] from him.
062:006 He only [is] my rock H6697 and my salvation H3444: [he is] my defence H4869; I shall not be moved H4131 (8735).
062:007 In God H0430 [is] my salvation H3468 and my glory H3519: the rock H6697 of my strength H5797, [and] my refuge H4268, [is] in God H0430.
062:008 Trust H0982 (8798) in him at all times H6256; [ye] people H5971, pour out H8210 (8798) your heart H3824 before H6440 him: God H0430 [is] a refuge H4268 for us. Selah H5542.
062:009 Surely men H0120 H1121 of low degree [are] vanity H1892, [and] men H0376 of high degree [are] a lie H3577: to be laid H5927 (8800) in the balance H3976, they [are] altogether H3162 [lighter] than vanity H1892.
062:010 Trust H0982 (8799) not in oppression H6233, and become not vain H1891 (8799) in robbery H1498: if riches H2428 increase H5107 (8799), set H7896 (8799) not your heart H3820 [upon them].
062:011 God H0430 hath spoken H1696 (8765) once H0259; twice H8147 have I heard H8085 (8804) this H2098; that power H5797 [belongeth] unto God H0430.
062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord H0136, [belongeth] mercy H2617: for thou renderest H7999 (8762) to every man H0376 according to his work H4639.
063:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732, when he was in the wilderness H4057 of Judah H3063.» O God H0430, thou [art] my God H0410; early will I seek H7836 (8762) thee: my soul H5315 thirsteth H6770 (8804) for thee, my flesh H1320 longeth H3642 (8804) for thee in a dry H6723 and thirsty H5889 land H0776, where no H1097 water H4325 is;
063:002 To see H7200 (8800) thy power H5797 and thy glory H3519, so [as] I have seen H2372 (8804) thee in the sanctuary H6944.
063:003 Because thy lovingkindness H2617 [is] better H2896 than life H2416, my lips H8193 shall praise H7623 (8762) thee.
063:004 Thus will I bless H1288 (8762) thee while I live H2416: I will lift up H5375 (8799) my hands H3709 in thy name H8034.
063:005 My soul H5315 shall be satisfied H7646 (8799) as [with] marrow H2459 and fatness H1880; and my mouth H6310 shall praise H1984 (8762) [thee] with joyful H7445 lips H8193:
063:006 When I remember H2142 (8804) thee upon my bed H3326, [and] meditate H1897 (8799) on thee in the [night] watches H0821.
063:007 Because thou hast been my help H5833, therefore in the shadow H6738 of thy wings H3671 will I rejoice H7442 (8762).
063:008 My soul H5315 followeth hard H1692 (8804) after H0310 thee: thy right hand H3225 upholdeth H8551 (8804) me.
063:009 But those [that] seek H1245 (8762) my soul H5315, to destroy H7722 [it], shall go H0935 (8799) into the lower parts H8482 of the earth H0776.
063:010 They shall fall H5064 (8686) by the sword H3027 H2719: they shall be a portion H4521 for foxes H7776.
063:011 But the king H4428 shall rejoice H8055 (8799) in God H0430; every one that sweareth H7650 (8737) by him shall glory H1984 (8691): but the mouth H6310 of them that speak H1696 (8802) lies H8267 shall be stopped H5534 (8735).
064:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Hear H8085 (8798) my voice H6963, O God H0430, in my prayer H7879: preserve H5341 (8799) my life H2416 from fear H6343 of the enemy H0341 (8802).
064:002 Hide H5641 (8686) me from the secret counsel H5475 of the wicked H7489 (8688); from the insurrection H7285 of the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205:
064:003 Who whet H8150 (8804) their tongue H3956 like a sword H2719, [and] bend H1869 (8804) [their bows to shoot] their arrows H2671, [even] bitter H4751 words H1697:
064:004 That they may shoot H3384 (8800) in secret H4565 at the perfect H8535: suddenly H6597 do they shoot H3384 (8686) at him, and fear H3372 (8799) not.
064:005 They encourage H2388 (8762) themselves [in] an evil H7451 matter H1697: they commune H5608 (8762) of laying H2934 snares H4170 privily H2934 (8800); they say H0559 (8804), Who shall see H7200 (8799) them?
064:006 They search out H2664 (8799) iniquities H5766; they accomplish H8552 (8804) a diligent H2664 (8794) search H2665: both the inward H7130 [thought] of every one H0376 [of them], and the heart H3820, [is] deep H6013.
064:007 But God H0430 shall shoot H3384 (8686) at them [with] an arrow H2671; suddenly H6597 shall they be wounded H4347.
064:008 So they shall make their own tongue H3956 to fall H3782 (8686) upon themselves: all that see H7200 (8802) them shall flee away H5074 (8709).
064:009 And all men H0120 shall fear H3372 (8799), and shall declare H5046 (8686) the work H6467 of God H0430; for they shall wisely consider H7919 (8689) of his doing H4639.
064:010 The righteous H6662 shall be glad H8055 (8799) in the LORD H3068, and shall trust H2620 (8804) in him; and all the upright H3477 in heart H3820 shall glory H1984 (8691).
065:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 [and] Song H7892 of David H1732.» Praise H8416 waiteth H1747 for thee, O God H0430, in Sion H6726: and unto thee shall the vow H5088 be performed H7999 (8792).
065:002 O thou that hearest H8085 (8802) prayer H8605, unto thee shall all flesh H1320 come H0935 (8799).
065:003 Iniquities H1697 H5771 prevail H1396 (8804) against me: [as for] our transgressions H6588, thou shalt purge them away H3722 (8762).
065:004 Blessed H0835 [is the man whom] thou choosest H0977 (8799), and causest to approach H7126 (8762) [unto thee, that] he may dwell H7931 (8799) in thy courts H2691: we shall be satisfied H7646 (8799) with the goodness H2898 of thy house H1004, [even] of thy holy H6918 temple H1964.
065:005 [By] terrible things H3372 (8737) in righteousness H6664 wilt thou answer H6030 (8799) us, O God H0430 of our salvation H3468; [who art] the confidence H4009 of all the ends H7099 of the earth H0776, and of them that are afar off H7350 [upon] the sea H3220:
065:006 Which by his strength H3581 setteth fast H3559 (8688) the mountains H2022; [being] girded H0247 (8737) with power H1369:
065:007 Which stilleth H7623 (8688) the noise H7588 of the seas H3220, the noise H7588 of their waves H1530, and the tumult H1995 of the people H3816.
065:008 They also that dwell H3427 (8802) in the uttermost parts H7099 are afraid H3372 (8799) at thy tokens H0226: thou makest the outgoings H4161 of the morning H1242 and evening H6153 to rejoice H7442 (8686).
065:009 Thou visitest H6485 (8804) the earth H0776, and waterest H7783 (8787) it: thou greatly H7227 enrichest H6238 (8686) it with the river H6388 of God H0430, [which] is full H4390 (8804) of water H4325: thou preparest H3559 (8686) them corn H1715, when thou hast so provided H3559 (8686) for it.
065:010 Thou waterest H7301 the ridges H8525 thereof abundantly H7301 (8761): thou settlest H5181 (8763) the furrows H1417 (8676) H1418 thereof: thou makest it soft H4127 (8787) with showers H7241: thou blessest H1288 (8762) the springing H6780 thereof.
065:011 Thou crownest H5849 (8765) the year H8141 with thy goodness H2896; and thy paths H4570 drop H7491 (8799) fatness H1880.
065:012 They drop H7491 (8799) [upon] the pastures H4999 of the wilderness H4057: and the little hills H1389 rejoice H1524 on every side H2296 (8799).
065:013 The pastures H3733 are clothed H3847 (8804) with flocks H6629; the valleys H6010 also are covered over H5848 (8799) with corn H1250; they shout for joy H7321 (8709), they also sing H7891 (8799).
066:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Song H7892 [or] Psalm H4210.» Make a joyful noise H7321 (8685) unto God H0430, all ye lands H0776:
066:002 Sing forth H2167 (8761) the honour H3519 of his name H8034: make H7760 (8798) his praise H8416 glorious H3519.
066:003 Say H0559 (8798) unto God H0430, How terrible H3372 (8737) [art thou in] thy works H4639! through the greatness H7230 of thy power H5797 shall thine enemies H0341 (8802) submit H3584 (8762) themselves unto thee.
066:004 All the earth H0776 shall worship H7812 (8691) thee, and shall sing H2167 (8762) unto thee; they shall sing H2167 (8762) [to] thy name H8034. Selah H5542.
066:005 Come H3212 (8798) and see H7200 (8798) the works H4659 of God H0430: [he is] terrible H3372 (8737) [in his] doing H5949 toward the children H1121 of men H0120.
066:006 He turned H2015 (8804) the sea H3220 into dry H3004 [land]: they went H5674 (8799) through the flood H5104 on foot H7272: there did we rejoice H8055 (8799) in him.
066:007 He ruleth H4910 (8802) by his power H1369 for ever H5769; his eyes H5869 behold H6822 (8799) the nations H1471: let not the rebellious H5637 (8802) exalt H7311 (8799) (8675) H7311 (8686) themselves. Selah H5542.
066:008 O bless H1288 (8761) our God H0430, ye people H5971, and make the voice H6963 of his praise H8416 to be heard H8085 (8685):
066:009 Which holdeth H7760 (8802) our soul H5315 in life H2416, and suffereth H5414 (8804) not our feet H7272 to be moved H4132.
066:010 For thou, O God H0430, hast proved H0974 (8804) us: thou hast tried H6884 (8804) us, as silver H3701 is tried H6884 (8800).
066:011 Thou broughtest H0935 (8689) us into the net H4686; thou laidst H7760 (8804) affliction H4157 upon our loins H4975.
066:012 Thou hast caused men H0582 to ride H7392 (8689) over our heads H7218; we went H0935 (8804) through fire H0784 and through water H4325: but thou broughtest us out H3318 (8686) into a wealthy H7310 [place].
066:013 I will go H0935 (8799) into thy house H1004 with burnt offerings H5930: I will pay H7999 (8762) thee my vows H5088,
066:014 Which my lips H8193 have uttered H6475 (8804), and my mouth H6310 hath spoken H1696 (8765), when I was in trouble H6862.
066:015 I will offer H5927 (8686) unto thee burnt sacrifices H5930 of fatlings H4220, with the incense H7004 of rams H0352; I will offer H6213 (8799) bullocks H1241 with goats H6260. Selah H5542.
066:016 Come H3212 (8798) [and] hear H8085 (8798), all ye that fear H3373 God H0430, and I will declare H5608 (8762) what he hath done H6213 (8804) for my soul H5315.
066:017 I cried H7121 (8804) unto him with my mouth H6310, and he was extolled H7311 (8785) (8676) H7318 (8785) with H8478 my tongue H3956.
066:018 If I regard H7200 (8804) iniquity H0205 in my heart H3820, the Lord H0136 will not hear H8085 (8799) [me]:
066:019 [But] verily H0403 God H0430 hath heard H8085 (8804) [me]; he hath attended H7181 (8689) to the voice H6963 of my prayer H8605.
066:020 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] God H0430, which hath not turned away H5493 (8689) my prayer H8605, nor his mercy H2617 from me.
067:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) on Neginoth H5058, A Psalm H4210 [or] Song H7892.» God H0430 be merciful H2603 (8799) unto us, and bless H1288 (8762) us; [and] cause his face H6440 to shine H0215 (8686) upon us; Selah H5542.
067:002 That thy way H1870 may be known H3045 (8800) upon earth H0776, thy saving health H3444 among all nations H1471.
067:003 Let the people H5971 praise H3034 (8686) thee, O God H0430; let all the people H5971 praise H3034 (8686) thee.
067:004 O let the nations H3816 be glad H8055 (8799) and sing for joy H7442 (8762): for thou shalt judge H8199 (8799) the people H5971 righteously H4334, and govern H5148 (8686) the nations H3816 upon earth H0776. Selah H5542.
067:005 Let the people H5971 praise H3034 (8686) thee, O God H0430; let all the people H5971 praise H3034 (8686) thee.
067:006 [Then] shall the earth H0776 yield H5414 (8804) her increase H2981; [and] God H0430, [even] our own God H0430, shall bless H1288 (8762) us.
067:007 God H0430 shall bless H1288 (8762) us; and all the ends H0657 of the earth H0776 shall fear H3372 (8799) him.
068:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 [or] Song H7892 of David H1732.» Let God H0430 arise H6965 (8799), let his enemies H0341 (8802) be scattered H6327 (8799): let them also that hate H8130 (8764) him flee H5127 (8799) before H6440 him.
068:002 As smoke H6227 is driven away H5086 (8736), [so] drive [them] away H5086 (8799): as wax H1749 melteth H4549 (8736) before H6440 the fire H0784, [so] let the wicked H7563 perish H0006 (8799) at the presence H6440 of God H0430.
068:003 But let the righteous H6662 be glad H8055 (8799); let them rejoice H5970 (8799) before H6440 God H0430: yea, let them exceedingly H8057 rejoice H7797 (8799).
068:004 Sing H7891 (8798) unto God H0430, sing praises H2167 (8761) to his name H8034: extol H5549 (8798) him that rideth H7392 (8802) upon the heavens H6160 by his name H8034 JAH H3050, and rejoice H5937 (8798) before H6440 him.
068:005 A father H0001 of the fatherless H3490, and a judge H1781 of the widows H0490, [is] God H0430 in his holy H6944 habitation H4583.
068:006 God H0430 setteth H3427 (8688) the solitary H3173 in families H1004: he bringeth out H3318 (8688) those which are bound H0615 with chains H3574: but the rebellious H5637 (8802) dwell H7931 (8804) in a dry H6707 [land].
068:007 O God H0430, when thou wentest forth H3318 (8800) before H6440 thy people H5971, when thou didst march H6805 (8800) through the wilderness H3452; Selah H5542:
068:008 The earth H0776 shook H7493 (8804), the heavens H8064 also dropped H5197 (8804) at the presence H6440 of God H0430: [even] Sinai H5514 itself H2088 [was moved] at the presence H6440 of God H0430, the God H0430 of Israel H3478.
068:009 Thou, O God H0430, didst send H5130 (8686) a plentiful H5071 rain H1653, whereby thou didst confirm H3559 (8790) thine inheritance H5159, when it was weary H3811 (8738).
068:010 Thy congregation H2416 hath dwelt H3427 (8804) therein: thou, O God H0430, hast prepared H3559 (8686) of thy goodness H2896 for the poor H6041.
068:011 The Lord H0136 gave H5414 (8799) the word H0562: great H7227 [was] the company H6635 of those that published H1319 (8764) [it].
068:012 Kings H4428 of armies H6635 did flee H5074 (8799) apace H5074 (8799): and she that tarried H5116 at home H1004 divided H2505 (8762) the spoil H7998.
068:013 Though ye have lien H7901 (8799) among the pots H8240, [yet shall ye be as] the wings H3671 of a dove H3123 covered H2645 (8737) with silver H3701, and her feathers H0084 with yellow H3422 gold H2742.
068:014 When the Almighty H7706 scattered H6566 (8763) kings H4428 in it, it was [white] as snow H7949 (8686) in Salmon H6756.
068:015 The hill H2022 of God H0430 [is as] the hill H2022 of Bashan H1316; an high H1386 hill H2022 [as] the hill H2022 of Bashan H1316.
068:016 Why leap H7520 (8762) ye, ye high H1386 hills H2022? [this is] the hill H2022 [which] God H0430 desireth H2530 (8804) to dwell in H3427 (8800); yea, the LORD H3068 will dwell H7931 (8799) [in it] for ever H5331.
068:017 The chariots H7393 of God H0430 [are] twenty thousand H7239, [even] thousands H0505 of angels H8136: the Lord H0136 [is] among them, [as in] Sinai H5514, in the holy H6944 [place].
068:018 Thou hast ascended H5927 (8804) on high H4791, thou hast led captivity H7628 captive H7617 (8804): thou hast received H3947 (8804) gifts H4979 for men H0120; yea, [for] the rebellious H5637 (8802) also, that the LORD H3050 God H0430 might dwell H7931 (8800) [among them].
068:019 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the Lord H0136, [who] daily H3117 H3117 loadeth H6006 (8799) us [with benefits, even] the God H0410 of our salvation H3444. Selah H5542.
068:020 [He that is] our God H0410 [is] the God H0410 of salvation H4190; and unto GOD H3069 the Lord H0136 [belong] the issues H8444 from death H4194.
068:021 But God H0430 shall wound H4272 (8799) the head H7218 of his enemies H0341 (8802), [and] the hairy H8181 scalp H6936 of such an one as goeth on still H1980 (8693) in his trespasses H0817.
068:022 The Lord H0136 said H0559 (8804), I will bring again H7725 (8686) from Bashan H1316, I will bring [my people] again H7725 (8686) from the depths H4688 of the sea H3220:
068:023 That thy foot H7272 may be dipped H4272 (8799) in the blood H1818 of [thine] enemies H0341 (8802), [and] the tongue H3956 of thy dogs H3611 in the same.
068:024 They have seen H7200 (8804) thy goings H1979, O God H0430; [even] the goings H1979 of my God H0410, my King H4428, in the sanctuary H6944.
068:025 The singers H7891 (8802) went before H6923 (8765), the players on instruments H5059 (8802) [followed] after H0310; among H8432 [them were] the damsels H5959 playing with timbrels H8608 (8802).
068:026 Bless H1288 (8761) ye God H0430 in the congregations H4721, [even] the Lord H0136, from the fountain H4726 of Israel H3478.
068:027 There [is] little H6810 Benjamin H1144 [with] their ruler H7287 (8802), the princes H8269 of Judah H3063 [and] their council H7277, the princes H8269 of Zebulun H2074, [and] the princes H8269 of Naphtali H5321.
068:028 Thy God H0430 hath commanded H6680 (8765) thy strength H5797: strengthen H5810 (8798), O God H0430, that which H2098 thou hast wrought H6466 (8804) for us.
068:029 Because of thy temple H1964 at Jerusalem H3389 shall kings H4428 bring H2986 (8686) presents H7862 unto thee.
068:030 Rebuke H1605 (8798) the company H2416 of spearmen H7070, the multitude H5712 of the bulls H0047, with the calves H5695 of the people H5971, [till every one] submit H7511 (8693) himself with pieces H7518 of silver H3701: scatter H0967 (8765) thou the people H5971 [that] delight H2654 (8799) in war H7128.
068:031 Princes H2831 shall come out H0857 (8799) of Egypt H4714; Ethiopia H3568 shall soon stretch out H7323 (8686) her hands H3027 unto God H0430.
068:032 Sing H7891 (8798) unto God H0430, ye kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776; O sing praises H2167 (8761) unto the Lord H0136; Selah H5542:
068:033 To him that rideth H7392 (8802) upon the heavens H8064 of heavens H8064, [which were] of old H6924; lo, he doth send out H5414 (8799) his voice H6963, [and that] a mighty H5797 voice H6963.
068:034 Ascribe H5414 (8798) ye strength H5797 unto God H0430: his excellency H1346 [is] over Israel H3478, and his strength H5797 [is] in the clouds H7834.
068:035 O God H0430, [thou art] terrible H3372 (8737) out of thy holy places H4720: the God H0410 of Israel H3478 [is] he that giveth H5414 (8802) strength H5797 and power H8592 unto [his] people H5971. Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] God H0430.
069:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Shoshannim H7799, [A Psalm] of David H1732.» Save H3467 (8685) me, O God H0430; for the waters H4325 are come H0935 (8804) in unto [my] soul H5315.
069:002 I sink H2883 (8804) in deep H4688 mire H3121, where [there is] no standing H4613: I am come H0935 (8804) into deep H4615 waters H4325, where the floods H7641 overflow H7857 (8804) me.
069:003 I am weary H3021 (8804) of my crying H7121 (8800): my throat H1627 is dried H2787 (8738): mine eyes H5869 fail H3615 (8804) while I wait H3176 (8764) for my God H0430.
069:004 They that hate H8130 (8802) me without a cause H2600 are more H7231 (8804) than the hairs H8185 of mine head H7218: they that would destroy H6789 (8688) me, [being] mine enemies H0341 (8802) wrongfully H8267, are mighty H6105 (8804): then I restored H7725 (8686) [that] which I took not away H1497 (8804).
069:005 O God H0430, thou knowest H3045 (8804) my foolishness H0200; and my sins H0819 are not hid H3582 (8738) from thee.
069:006 Let not them that wait H6960 (8802) on thee, O Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635, be ashamed H0954 (8799) for my sake: let not those that seek H1245 (8764) thee be confounded H3637 (8735) for my sake, O God H0430 of Israel H3478.
069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne H5375 (8804) reproach H2781; shame H3639 hath covered H3680 (8765) my face H6440.
069:008 I am become a stranger H2114 (8716) unto my brethren H0251, and an alien H5237 unto my mother’s H0517 children H1121.
069:009 For the zeal H7068 of thine house H1004 hath eaten me up H0398 (8804); and the reproaches H2781 of them that reproached H2778 (8802) thee are fallen H5307 (8804) upon me.
069:010 When I wept H1058 (8799), [and chastened] my soul H5315 with fasting H6685, that was to my reproach H2781.
069:011 I made H5414 (8799) sackcloth H8242 also my garment H3830; and I became a proverb H4912 to them.
069:012 They that sit in H3427 (8802) the gate H8179 speak H7878 (8799) against me; and I [was] the song H5058 of the drunkards H8354 (8802) H7941.
069:013 But as for me, my prayer H8605 [is] unto thee, O LORD H3068, [in] an acceptable H7522 time H6256: O God H0430, in the multitude H7230 of thy mercy H2617 hear H6030 (8798) me, in the truth H0571 of thy salvation H3468.
069:014 Deliver H5337 (8685) me out of the mire H2916, and let me not sink H2883 (8799): let me be delivered H5337 (8735) from them that hate H8130 (8802) me, and out of the deep H4615 waters H4325.
069:015 Let not the waterflood H4325 H7641 overflow H7857 (8799) me, neither let the deep H4688 swallow me up H1104 (8799), and let not the pit H0875 shut H0332 (8799) her mouth H6310 upon me.
069:016 Hear H6030 (8798) me, O LORD H3068; for thy lovingkindness H2617 [is] good H2896: turn H6437 (8798) unto me according to the multitude H7230 of thy tender mercies H7356.
069:017 And hide H5641 (8686) not thy face H6440 from thy servant H5650; for I am in trouble H6887 (8804): hear H6030 (8798) me speedily H4118.
069:018 Draw nigh H7126 (8798) unto my soul H5315, [and] redeem H1350 (8798) it: deliver H6299 (8798) me because of mine enemies H0341 (8802).
069:019 Thou hast known H3045 (8804) my reproach H2781, and my shame H1322, and my dishonour H3639: mine adversaries H6887 (8802) [are] all before thee.
069:020 Reproach H2781 hath broken H7665 (8804) my heart H3820; and I am full of heaviness H5136 (8799): and I looked H6960 (8762) [for some] to take pity H5110 (8800), but [there was] none; and for comforters H5162 (8764), but I found H4672 (8804) none.
069:021 They gave H5414 (8799) me also gall H7219 for my meat H1267; and in my thirst H6772 they gave me vinegar H2558 to drink H8248 (8686).
069:022 Let their table H7979 become a snare H6341 before H6440 them: and [that which should have been] for [their] welfare H7965, [let it become] a trap H4170.
069:023 Let their eyes H5869 be darkened H2821 (8799), that they see H7200 (8800) not; and make their loins H4975 continually H8548 to shake H4571 (8685).
069:024 Pour out H8210 (8798) thine indignation H2195 upon them, and let thy wrathful H2740 anger H0639 take hold H5381 (8686) of them.
069:025 Let their habitation H2918 be desolate H8074 (8737); [and] let none dwell H3427 (8802) in their tents H0168.
069:026 For they persecute H7291 (8804) [him] whom thou hast smitten H5221 (8689); and they talk H5608 (8762) to the grief H4341 of those whom thou hast wounded H2491.
069:027 Add H5414 (8798) iniquity H5771 unto their iniquity H5771: and let them not come H0935 (8799) into thy righteousness H6666.
069:028 Let them be blotted H4229 (8735) out of the book H5612 of the living H2416, and not be written H3789 (8735) with the righteous H6662.
069:029 But I [am] poor H6041 and sorrowful H3510 (8802): let thy salvation H3444, O God H0430, set me up on high H7682 (8762).
069:030 I will praise H1984 (8762) the name H8034 of God H0430 with a song H7892, and will magnify H1431 (8762) him with thanksgiving H8426.
069:031 [This] also shall please H3190 the LORD H3068 better H3190 (8799) than an ox H7794 [or] bullock H6499 that hath horns H7160 (8688) and hoofs H6536 (8688).
069:032 The humble H6035 shall see H7200 (8804) [this, and] be glad H8055 (8799): and your heart H3824 shall live H2421 (8799) that seek H1875 (8802) God H0430.
069:033 For the LORD H3068 heareth H8085 (8802) the poor H0034, and despiseth H0959 (8804) not his prisoners H0615.
069:034 Let the heaven H8064 and earth H0776 praise H1984 (8762) him, the seas H3220, and every thing that moveth H7430 (8802) therein.
069:035 For God H0430 will save H3467 (8686) Zion H6726, and will build H1129 (8799) the cities H5892 of Judah H3063: that they may dwell H3427 (8804) there, and have it in possession H3423 (8804).
069:036 The seed H2233 also of his servants H5650 shall inherit H5157 (8799) it: and they that love H0157 (8802) his name H8034 shall dwell H7931 (8799) therein.
070:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), [A Psalm] of David H1732, to bring to remembrance H2142 (8687).» [Make haste], O God H0430, to deliver H5337 (8687) me; make haste H2363 (8798) to help H5833 me, O LORD H3068.
070:002 Let them be ashamed H0954 (8799) and confounded H2659 (8799) that seek H1245 (8764) after my soul H5315: let them be turned H5472 (8735) backward H0268, and put to confusion H3637 (8735), that desire H2655 my hurt H7451.
070:003 Let them be turned back H7725 (8799) for a reward H6118 of their shame H1322 that say H0559 (8802), Aha H1889, aha H1889.
070:004 Let all those that seek H1245 (8764) thee rejoice H7797 (8799) and be glad H8055 (8799) in thee: and let such as love H0157 (8802) thy salvation H3444 say H0559 (8799) continually H8548, Let God H0430 be magnified H1431 (8799).
070:005 But I [am] poor H6041 and needy H0034: make haste H2363 (8798) unto me, O God H0430: thou [art] my help H5828 and my deliverer H6403 (8764); O LORD H3068, make no tarrying H0309 (8762).
071:001 ¶  In thee, O LORD H3068, do I put my trust H2620 (8804): let me never H0408 H5769 be put to confusion H0954 (8799).
071:002 Deliver H5337 (8686) me in thy righteousness H6666, and cause me to escape H6403 (8762): incline H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241 unto me, and save H3467 (8685) me.
071:003 Be thou my strong H6697 habitation H4583, whereunto I may continually H8548 resort H0935 (8800): thou hast given commandment H6680 (8765) to save H3467 (8687) me; for thou [art] my rock H5553 and my fortress H4686.
071:004 Deliver H6403 (8761) me, O my God H0430, out of the hand H3027 of the wicked H7563, out of the hand H3709 of the unrighteous H5765 (8764) and cruel man H2556 (8802).
071:005 For thou [art] my hope H8615, O Lord H0136 GOD H3069: [thou art] my trust H4009 from my youth H5271.
071:006 By thee have I been holden up H5564 (8738) from the womb H0990: thou art he that took H1491 (8802) me out of my mother’s H0517 bowels H4578: my praise H8416 [shall be] continually H8548 of thee.
071:007 I am as a wonder H4159 unto many H7227; but thou [art] my strong H5797 refuge H4268.
071:008 Let my mouth H6310 be filled H4390 (8735) [with] thy praise H8416 [and with] thy honour H8597 all the day H3117.
071:009 Cast me not off H7993 (8686) in the time H6256 of old age H2209; forsake H5800 (8799) me not when my strength H3581 faileth H3615 (8800).
071:010 For mine enemies H0341 (8802) speak H0559 (8804) against me; and they that lay wait H8104 (8802) for my soul H5315 take counsel H3289 (8738) together H3162,
071:011 Saying H0559 (8800), God H0430 hath forsaken H5800 (8804) him: persecute H7291 (8798) and take H8610 (8798) him; for [there is] none to deliver H5337 (8688) [him].
071:012 O God H0430, be not far H7368 (8799) from me: O my God H0430, make haste H2363 (8798) (8675) H2439 for my help H5833.
071:013 Let them be confounded H0954 (8799) [and] consumed H3615 (8799) that are adversaries H7853 (8802) to my soul H5315; let them be covered H5844 (8799) [with] reproach H2781 and dishonour H3639 that seek H1245 (8764) my hurt H7451.
071:014 But I will hope H3176 (8762) continually H8548, and will yet praise H8416 thee more H3254 (8689) and more H3254 (8689).
071:015 My mouth H6310 shall shew forth H5608 (8762) thy righteousness H6666 [and] thy salvation H8668 all the day H3117; for I know H3045 (8804) not the numbers H5615 [thereof].
071:016 I will go in H0935 (8799) the strength H1369 of the Lord H0136 GOD H3069: I will make mention H2142 (8686) of thy righteousness H6666, [even] of thine only.
071:017 O God H0430, thou hast taught H3925 (8765) me from my youth H5271: and hitherto have I declared H5046 (8686) thy wondrous works H6381 (8737).
071:018 Now also when H5704 I am old H2209 and grayheaded H7872, O God H0430, forsake H5800 (8799) me not; until I have shewed H5046 (8686) thy strength H2220 unto [this] generation H1755, [and] thy power H1369 to every one [that] is to come H0935 (8799).
071:019 Thy righteousness H6666 also, O God H0430, [is] very high H4791, who hast done H6213 (8804) great things H1419: O God H0430, who [is] like unto thee!
071:020 [Thou], which hast shewed H7200 (8689) me great H7227 and sore H7451 troubles H6869, shalt quicken H2421 (8762) me again H7725 (8799), and shalt bring me up H5927 (8686) again H7725 (8799) from the depths H8415 of the earth H0776.
071:021 Thou shalt increase H7235 (8686) my greatness H1420, and comfort H5162 (8762) me on every side H5437 (8735).
071:022 I will also praise H3034 (8686) thee with the psaltery H3627 (8676) H5035, [even] thy truth H0571, O my God H0430: unto thee will I sing H2167 (8762) with the harp H3658, O thou Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
071:023 My lips H8193 shall greatly rejoice H7442 (8762) when I sing H2167 (8762) unto thee; and my soul H5315, which thou hast redeemed H6299 (8804).
071:024 My tongue H3956 also shall talk H1897 (8799) of thy righteousness H6666 all the day H3117 long: for they are confounded H0954 (8804), for they are brought unto shame H2659 (8804), that seek H1245 (8764) my hurt H7451.
072:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] for Solomon H8010.» Give H5414 (8798) the king H4428 thy judgments H4941, O God H0430, and thy righteousness H6666 unto the king’s H4428 son H1121.
072:002 He shall judge H1777 (8799) thy people H5971 with righteousness H6664, and thy poor H6041 with judgment H4941.
072:003 The mountains H2022 shall bring H5375 (8799) peace H7965 to the people H5971, and the little hills H1389, by righteousness H6666.
072:004 He shall judge H8199 (8799) the poor H6041 of the people H5971, he shall save H3467 (8686) the children H1121 of the needy H0034, and shall break in pieces H1792 (8762) the oppressor H6231 (8802).
072:005 They shall fear H3372 (8799) thee as long as H5973 the sun H8121 and moon H3394 endure H6440, throughout all H1755 generations H1755.
072:006 He shall come down H3381 (8799) like rain H4306 upon the mown H1488 grass: as showers H7241 [that] water H2222 the earth H0776.
072:007 In his days H3117 shall the righteous H6662 flourish H6524 (8799); and abundance H7230 of peace H7965 so long as the moon H3394 endureth.
072:008 He shall have dominion H7287 (8799) also from sea H3220 to sea H3220, and from the river H5104 unto the ends H0657 of the earth H0776.
072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness H6728 shall bow H3766 (8799) before H6440 him; and his enemies H0341 (8802) shall lick H3897 (8762) the dust H6083.
072:010 The kings H4428 of Tarshish H8659 and of the isles H0339 shall bring H7725 (8686) presents H4503: the kings H4428 of Sheba H7614 and Seba H5434 shall offer H7126 (8686) gifts H0814.
072:011 Yea, all kings H4428 shall fall down H7812 (8691) before him: all nations H1471 shall serve H5647 (8799) him.
072:012 For he shall deliver H5337 (8686) the needy H0034 when he crieth H7768 (8764); the poor H6041 also, and [him] that hath no helper H5826 (8802).
072:013 He shall spare H2347 (8799) the poor H1800 and needy H0034, and shall save H3467 (8686) the souls H5315 of the needy H0034.
072:014 He shall redeem H1350 (8799) their soul H5315 from deceit H8496 and violence H2555: and precious H3365 (8799) shall their blood H1818 be in his sight H5869.
072:015 And he shall live H2421 (8799), and to him shall be given H5414 (8799) of the gold H2091 of Sheba H7614: prayer also shall be made H6419 (8691) for him continually H8548; [and] daily H3117 shall he be praised H1288 (8762).
072:016 There shall be an handful H6451 of corn H1250 in the earth H0776 upon the top H7218 of the mountains H2022; the fruit H6529 thereof shall shake H7493 (8799) like Lebanon H3844: and [they] of the city H5892 shall flourish H6692 (8686) like grass H6212 of the earth H0776.
072:017 His name H8034 shall endure for ever H5769: his name H8034 shall be continued H5125 (8735) (8675) H5125 (8686) as long as H6440 the sun H8121: and [men] shall be blessed H1288 (8691) in him: all nations H1471 shall call him blessed H0833 (8762).
072:018 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 God H0430, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, who only doeth H6213 (8802) wondrous things H6381 (8737).
072:019 And blessed H1288 (8803) [be] his glorious H3519 name H8034 for ever H5769: and let the whole earth H0776 be filled H4390 (8735) [with] his glory H3519; Amen H0543, and Amen H0543.
072:020 The prayers H8605 of David H1732 the son H1121 of Jesse H3448 are ended H3615 (8795).
073:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of Asaph H0623.» Truly God H0430 [is] good H2896 to Israel H3478, [even] to such as are of a clean H1249 heart H3824.
073:002 But as for me, my feet H7272 were almost H4592 gone H5186 (8804) (8675) H5186 (8803); my steps H0838 had well nigh H0369 slipped H8210 (8795).
073:003 For I was envious H7065 (8765) at the foolish H1984 (8802), [when] I saw H7200 (8799) the prosperity H7965 of the wicked H7563.
073:004 For [there are] no bands H2784 in their death H4194: but their strength H0193 [is] firm H1277.
073:005 They [are] not in trouble H5999 [as other] men H0582; neither are they plagued H5060 (8792) like H5973 [other] men H0120.
073:006 Therefore pride H1346 compasseth them about as a chain H6059 (8804); violence H2555 covereth H5848 (8799) them [as] a garment H7897.
073:007 Their eyes H5869 stand out H3318 (8804) with fatness H2459: they have more H5674 (8804) than heart H3824 could wish H4906.
073:008 They are corrupt H4167 (8686), and speak H1696 (8762) wickedly H7451 [concerning] oppression H6233: they speak H1696 (8762) loftily H4791.
073:009 They set H8371 (8804) their mouth H6310 against the heavens H8064, and their tongue H3956 walketh H1980 (8799) through the earth H0776.
073:010 Therefore his people H5971 return H7725 (8799) (8675) H7725 (8686) hither H1988: and waters H4325 of a full H4392 [cup] are wrung out H4680 (8735) to them.
073:011 And they say H0559 (8804), How doth God H0410 know H3045 (8804)? and is there H3426 knowledge H1844 in the most High H5945?
073:012 Behold, these [are] the ungodly H7563, who prosper H7961 in the world H5769; they increase H7685 (8689) [in] riches H2428.
073:013 Verily I have cleansed H2135 (8765) my heart H3824 [in] vain H7385, and washed H7364 (8799) my hands H3709 in innocency H5356.
073:014 For all the day H3117 long have I been plagued H5060 (8803), and chastened H8433 every morning H1242.
073:015 If I say H0559 (8804), I will speak H5608 (8762) thus H3644; behold, I should offend H0898 (8804) [against] the generation H1755 of thy children H1121.
073:016 When I thought H2803 (8762) to know H3045 (8800) this, it [was] too painful H5999 for me H5869;
073:017 Until I went H0935 (8799) into the sanctuary H4720 of God H0410; [then] understood H0995 (8799) I their end H0319.
073:018 Surely thou didst set H7896 (8799) them in slippery places H2513: thou castedst them down H5307 (8689) into destruction H4876.
073:019 How are they [brought] into desolation H8047, as in a moment H7281! they are utterly H5486 (8804) consumed H8552 (8804) with terrors H1091.
073:020 As a dream H2472 when [one] awaketh H6974 (8687); [so], O Lord H0136, when thou awakest H5782, thou shalt despise H0959 (8799) their image H6754.
073:021 Thus my heart H3824 was grieved H2556 (8691), and I was pricked H8150 (8709) in my reins H3629.
073:022 So foolish H1198 [was] I, and ignorant H3045 (8799): I was [as] a beast H0929 before thee.
073:023 Nevertheless I [am] continually H8548 with thee: thou hast holden H0270 (8804) [me] by my right H3225 hand H3027.
073:024 Thou shalt guide H5148 (8686) me with thy counsel H6098, and afterward H0310 receive H3947 (8799) me [to] glory H3519.
073:025 Whom have I in heaven H8064 [but thee]? and [there is] none upon earth H0776 [that] I desire H2654 (8804) beside thee.
073:026 My flesh H7607 and my heart H3824 faileth H3615 (8804): [but] God H0430 [is] the strength H6697 of my heart H3824, and my portion H2506 for ever H5769.
073:027 For, lo, they that are far H7369 from thee shall perish H0006 (8799): thou hast destroyed H6789 (8689) all them that go a whoring H2181 (8802) from thee.
073:028 But H0589 [it is] good H2896 for me to draw near H7132 to God H0430: I have put H7896 (8804) my trust H4268 in the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, that I may declare H5608 (8763) all thy works H4399.
074:001 ¶  «Maschil H4905 (8688) of Asaph H0623.» O God H0430, why hast thou cast [us] off H2186 (8804) for ever H5331? [why] doth thine anger H0639 smoke H6225 (8799) against the sheep H6629 of thy pasture H4830?
074:002 Remember H2142 (8798) thy congregation H5712, [which] thou hast purchased H7069 (8804) of old H6924; the rod H7626 of thine inheritance H5159, [which] thou hast redeemed H1350 (8804); this mount H2022 Zion H6726, wherein thou hast dwelt H7931 (8804).
074:003 Lift up H7311 (8685) thy feet H6471 unto the perpetual H5331 desolations H4876; [even] all [that] the enemy H0341 (8802) hath done wickedly H7489 (8689) in the sanctuary H6944.
074:004 Thine enemies H6887 (8802) roar H7580 (8804) in the midst H7130 of thy congregations H4150; they set up H7760 (8804) their ensigns H0226 [for] signs H0226.
074:005 [A man] was famous H3045 (8735) according as he had lifted up H0935 (8688) H4605 axes H7134 upon the thick H5442 trees H6086.
074:006 But now they break down H1986 (8799) the carved work H6603 thereof at once H3162 with axes H3781 and hammers H3597.
074:007 They have cast H7971 (8765) fire H0784 into thy sanctuary H4720, they have defiled H2490 (8765) [by casting down] the dwelling place H4908 of thy name H8034 to the ground H0776.
074:008 They said H0559 (8804) in their hearts H3820, Let us destroy H3238 (8799) them together H3162: they have burned up H8313 (8804) all the synagogues H4150 of God H0410 in the land H0776.
074:009 We see H7200 (8804) not our signs H0226: [there is] no more any prophet H5030: neither [is there] among us any that knoweth H3045 (8802) how long H5704.
074:010 O God H0430, how long shall the adversary H6862 reproach H2778 (8762)? shall the enemy H0341 (8802) blaspheme H5006 (8762) thy name H8034 for ever H5331?
074:011 Why withdrawest H7725 (8686) thou thy hand H3027, even thy right hand H3225? pluck H3615 (8761) [it] out of H7130 thy bosom H2436 (8675) H2436.
074:012 For God H0430 [is] my King H4428 of old H6924, working H6466 (8802) salvation H3444 in the midst H7130 of the earth H0776.
074:013 Thou didst divide H6565 (8782) the sea H3220 by thy strength H5797: thou brakest H7665 (8765) the heads H7218 of the dragons H8577 in the waters H4325.
074:014 Thou brakest H7533 (8765) the heads H7218 of leviathan H3882 in pieces, [and] gavest H5414 (8799) him [to be] meat H3978 to the people H5971 inhabiting the wilderness H6728.
074:015 Thou didst cleave H1234 (8804) the fountain H4599 and the flood H5158: thou driedst up H3001 (8689) mighty H0386 rivers H5104.
074:016 The day H3117 [is] thine, the night H3915 also [is] thine: thou hast prepared H3559 (8689) the light H3974 and the sun H8121.
074:017 Thou hast set H5324 (8689) all the borders H1367 of the earth H0776: thou hast made H3335 (8804) summer H7019 and winter H2779.
074:018 Remember H2142 (8798) this, [that] the enemy H0341 (8802) hath reproached H2778 (8765), O LORD H3068, and [that] the foolish H5036 people H5971 have blasphemed H5006 (8765) thy name H8034.
074:019 O deliver H5414 (8799) not the soul H5315 of thy turtledove H8449 unto the multitude H2416 [of the wicked]: forget H7911 (8799) not the congregation H2416 of thy poor H6041 for ever H5331.
074:020 Have respect H5027 (8685) unto the covenant H1285: for the dark H4285 places of the earth H0776 are full H4390 (8804) of the habitations H4999 of cruelty H2555.
074:021 O let not the oppressed H1790 return H7725 (8799) ashamed H3637 (8737): let the poor H6041 and needy H0034 praise H1984 (8762) thy name H8034.
074:022 Arise H6965 (8798), O God H0430, plead H7378 (8798) thine own cause H7379: remember H2142 (8798) how the foolish man H5036 reproacheth H2781 thee daily H3117.
074:023 Forget H7911 (8799) not the voice H6963 of thine enemies H6887 (8802): the tumult H7588 of those that rise up H6965 (8801) against thee increaseth H5927 (8802) continually H8548.
075:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), Altaschith H0516 (8686), A Psalm H4210 [or] Song H7892 of Asaph H0623.» Unto thee, O God H0430, do we give thanks H3034 (8689), [unto thee] do we give thanks H3034 (8689): for [that] thy name H8034 is near H7138 thy wondrous works H6381 (8737) declare H5608 (8765).
075:002 When I shall receive H3947 (8799) the congregation H4150 I will judge H8199 (8799) uprightly H4339.
075:003 The earth H0776 and all the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof are dissolved H4127 (8737): I bear up H8505 (8765) the pillars H5982 of it. Selah H5542.
075:004 I said H0559 (8804) unto the fools H1984 (8802), Deal not foolishly H1984 (8799): and to the wicked H7563, Lift not up H7311 (8686) the horn H7161:
075:005 Lift not up H7311 (8686) your horn H7161 on high H4791: speak H1696 (8762) [not with] a stiff H6277 neck H6677.
075:006 For promotion H7311 (8687) (8676) H2022 [cometh] neither from the east H4161, nor from the west H4628, nor from the south H4057.
075:007 But God H0430 [is] the judge H8199 (8802): he putteth down H8213 (8686) one, and setteth up H7311 (8686) another.
075:008 For in the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 [there is] a cup H3563, and the wine H3196 is red H2560 (8804); it is full H4392 of mixture H4538; and he poureth out H5064 (8686) of the same H2088: but the dregs H8105 thereof, all the wicked H7563 of the earth H0776 shall wring [them] out H4680 (8799), [and] drink H8354 (8799) [them].
075:009 But I will declare H5046 (8686) for ever H5769; I will sing praises H2167 (8762) to the God H0430 of Jacob H3290.
075:010 All the horns H7161 of the wicked H7563 also will I cut off H1438 (8762); [but] the horns H7161 of the righteous H6662 shall be exalted H7311 (8783).
076:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) on Neginoth H5058, A Psalm H4210 [or] Song H7892 of Asaph H0623.» In Judah H3063 [is] God H0430 known H3045 (8737): his name H8034 [is] great H1419 in Israel H3478.
076:002 In Salem H8004 also is his tabernacle H5520, and his dwelling place H4585 in Zion H6726.
076:003 There brake H7665 (8765) he the arrows H7565 of the bow H7198, the shield H4043, and the sword H2719, and the battle H4421. Selah H5542.
076:004 Thou [art] more glorious H0215 (8737) [and] excellent H0117 than the mountains H2042 of prey H2964.
076:005 The stouthearted H0047 H3820 are spoiled H7997 (8709), they have slept H5123 (8804) their sleep H8142: and none of the men H0582 of might H2428 have found H4672 (8804) their hands H3027.
076:006 At thy rebuke H1606, O God H0430 of Jacob H3290, both the chariot H7393 and horse H5483 are cast into a dead sleep H7290 (8737).
076:007 Thou, [even] thou, [art] to be feared H3372 (8737): and who may stand H5975 (8799) in thy sight H6440 when H0227 once thou art angry H0639?
076:008 Thou didst cause judgment H1779 to be heard H8085 (8689) from heaven H8064; the earth H0776 feared H3372 (8804), and was still H8252 (8804),
076:009 When God H0430 arose H6965 (8800) to judgment H4941, to save H3467 (8687) all the meek H6035 of the earth H0776. Selah H5542.
076:010 Surely the wrath H2534 of man H0120 shall praise H3034 (8686) thee: the remainder H7611 of wrath H2534 shalt thou restrain H2296 (8799).
076:011 Vow H5087 (8798), and pay H7999 (8761) unto the LORD H3068 your God H0430: let all that be round about H5439 him bring H2986 (8686) presents H7862 unto him that ought to be feared H4172.
076:012 He shall cut off H1219 (8799) the spirit H7307 of princes H5057: [he is] terrible H3372 (8737) to the kings H4428 of the earth H0776.
077:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), to Jeduthun H3038, A Psalm H4210 of Asaph H0623.» I cried H6817 (8799) unto God H0430 with my voice H6963, [even] unto God H0430 with my voice H6963; and he gave ear H0238 (8689) unto me.
077:002 In the day H3117 of my trouble H6869 I sought H1875 (8804) the Lord H0136: my sore H3027 ran H5064 (8738) in the night H3915, and ceased H6313 (8799) not: my soul H5315 refused H3985 (8765) to be comforted H5162 (8736).
077:003 I remembered H2142 (8799) God H0430, and was troubled H1993 (8799): I complained H7878 (8799), and my spirit H7307 was overwhelmed H5848 (8691). Selah H5542.
077:004 Thou holdest H0270 (8804) mine eyes H5869 waking H8109: I am so troubled H6470 (8738) that I cannot speak H1696 (8762).
077:005 I have considered H2803 (8765) the days H3117 of old H6924, the years H8141 of ancient times H5769.
077:006 I call to remembrance H2142 (8799) my song H5058 in the night H3915: I commune H7878 (8799) with mine own heart H3824: and my spirit H7307 made diligent search H2664 (8762).
077:007 Will the Lord H0136 cast off H2186 (8799) for ever H5769? and will H3254 (8686) he be favourable H7521 (8800) no more?
077:008 Is his mercy H2617 clean gone H0656 (8804) for ever H5331? doth [his] promise H0562 fail H1584 (8804) for evermore H1755 H1755?
077:009 Hath God H0410 forgotten H7911 (8804) to be gracious H2589 (8800)? hath he in anger H0639 shut up H7092 (8804) his tender mercies H7356? Selah H5542.
077:010 And I said H0559 (8799), This [is] my infirmity H2470 (8763): [but I will remember] the years H8141 of the right hand H3225 of the most High H5945.
077:011 I will remember H2142 (8799) (8675) H2142 (8686) the works H4611 of the LORD H3050: surely I will remember H2142 (8799) thy wonders H6382 of old H6924.
077:012 I will meditate H1897 (8804) also of all thy work H6467, and talk H7878 (8799) of thy doings H5949.
077:013 Thy way H1870, O God H0430, [is] in the sanctuary H6944: who [is so] great H1419 a God H0410 as [our] God H0430?
077:014 Thou [art] the God H0410 that doest H6213 (8802) wonders H6382: thou hast declared H3045 (8689) thy strength H5797 among the people H5971.
077:015 Thou hast with [thine] arm H2220 redeemed H1350 (8804) thy people H5971, the sons H1121 of Jacob H3290 and Joseph H3130. Selah H5542.
077:016 The waters H4325 saw H7200 (8804) thee, O God H0430, the waters H4325 saw H7200 (8804) thee; they were afraid H2342 (8799): the depths H8415 also were troubled H7264 (8799).
077:017 The clouds H5645 poured out H2229 (8776) water H4325: the skies H7834 sent out H5414 (8804) a sound H6963: thine arrows H2687 also went abroad H1980 (8691).
077:018 The voice H6963 of thy thunder H7482 [was] in the heaven H1534: the lightnings H1300 lightened H0215 (8689) the world H8398: the earth H0776 trembled H7264 (8804) and shook H7493 (8799).
077:019 Thy way H1870 [is] in the sea H3220, and thy path H7635 in the great H7227 waters H4325, and thy footsteps H6119 are not known H3045 (8738).
077:020 Thou leddest H5148 (8804) thy people H5971 like a flock H6629 by the hand H3027 of Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175.
078:001 ¶  «Maschil H4905 (8688) of Asaph H0623.» Give ear H0238 (8685), O my people H5971, [to] my law H8451: incline H5186 (8685) your ears H0241 to the words H0561 of my mouth H6310.
078:002 I will open H6605 (8799) my mouth H6310 in a parable H4912: I will utter H5042 (8686) dark sayings H2420 of old H6924:
078:003 Which we have heard H8085 (8804) and known H3045 (8799), and our fathers H0001 have told H5608 (8765) us.
078:004 We will not hide H3582 (8762) [them] from their children H1121, shewing H5608 (8764) to the generation H1755 to come H0314 the praises H8416 of the LORD H3068, and his strength H5807, and his wonderful works H6381 (8737) that he hath done H6213 (8804).
078:005 For he established H6965 (8686) a testimony H5715 in Jacob H3290, and appointed H7760 (8804) a law H8451 in Israel H3478, which he commanded H6680 (8765) our fathers H0001, that they should make them known H3045 (8687) to their children H1121:
078:006 That the generation H1755 to come H0314 might know H3045 (8799) [them, even] the children H1121 [which] should be born H3205 (8735); [who] should arise H6965 (8799) and declare H5608 (8762) [them] to their children H1121:
078:007 That they might set H7760 (8799) their hope H3689 in God H0430, and not forget H7911 (8799) the works H4611 of God H0410, but keep H5341 (8799) his commandments H4687:
078:008 And might not be as their fathers H0001, a stubborn H5637 (8802) and rebellious H4784 (8802) generation H1755; a generation H1755 [that] set H3559 not their heart H3820 aright H3559 (8689), and whose spirit H7307 was not stedfast H0539 (8738) with God H0410.
078:009 The children H1121 of Ephraim H0669, [being] armed H5401 (8802), [and] carrying H7411 (8802) bows H7198, turned back H2015 (8804) in the day H3117 of battle H7128.
078:010 They kept H8104 (8804) not the covenant H1285 of God H0430, and refused H3985 (8765) to walk H3212 (8800) in his law H8451;
078:011 And forgat H7911 (8799) his works H5949, and his wonders H6381 (8737) that he had shewed H7200 (8689) them.
078:012 Marvellous things H6382 did H6213 (8804) he in the sight H5048 of their fathers H0001, in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, [in] the field H7704 of Zoan H6814.
078:013 He divided H1234 (8804) the sea H3220, and caused them to pass through H5674 (8686); and he made the waters H4325 to stand H5324 (8686) as an heap H5067.
078:014 In the daytime H3119 also he led H5148 (8686) them with a cloud H6051, and all the night H3915 with a light H0216 of fire H0784.
078:015 He clave H1234 (8762) the rocks H6697 in the wilderness H4057, and gave [them] drink H8248 (8686) as [out of] the great H7227 depths H8415.
078:016 He brought H3318 (8686) streams H5140 (8802) also out of the rock H5553, and caused waters H4325 to run down H3381 (8686) like rivers H5104.
078:017 And they sinned H2398 (8800) yet more H3254 (8686) against him by provoking H4784 (8687) the most High H5945 in the wilderness H6723.
078:018 And they tempted H5254 (8762) God H0410 in their heart H3824 by asking H7592 (8800) meat H0400 for their lust H5315.
078:019 Yea, they spake H1696 (8762) against God H0430; they said H0559 (8804), Can H3201 (8799) God H0410 furnish H6186 (8800) a table H7979 in the wilderness H4057?
078:020 Behold, he smote H5221 (8689) the rock H6697, that the waters H4325 gushed out H2100 (8799), and the streams H5158 overflowed H7857 (8799); can H3201 (8799) he give H5414 (8800) bread H3899 also? can H3201 (8799) he provide H3559 (8686) flesh H7607 for his people H5971?
078:021 Therefore the LORD H3068 heard H8085 (8804) [this], and was wroth H5674 (8691): so a fire H0784 was kindled H5400 (8738) against Jacob H3290, and anger H0639 also came up H5927 (8804) against Israel H3478;
078:022 Because they believed H0539 (8689) not in God H0430, and trusted H0982 (8804) not in his salvation H3444:
078:023 Though he had commanded H6680 (8762) the clouds H7834 from above H4605, and opened H6605 (8804) the doors H1817 of heaven H8064,
078:024 And had rained down H4305 (8686) manna H4478 upon them to eat H0398 (8800), and had given H5414 (8804) them of the corn H1715 of heaven H8064.
078:025 Man H0376 did eat H0398 (8804) angels H0047 ’ food H3899: he sent H7971 (8804) them meat H6720 to the full H7648.
078:026 He caused an east wind H6921 to blow H5265 (8686) in the heaven H8064: and by his power H5797 he brought in H5090 (8762) the south wind H8486.
078:027 He rained H4305 (8686) flesh H7607 also upon them as dust H6083, and feathered H3671 fowls H5775 like as the sand H2344 of the sea H3220:
078:028 And he let [it] fall H5307 (8686) in the midst H7130 of their camp H4264, round about H5439 their habitations H4908.
078:029 So they did eat H0398 (8799), and were well H3966 filled H7646 (8799): for he gave H0935 (8686) them their own desire H8378;
078:030 They were not estranged H2114 (8804) from their lust H8378. But while their meat H0400 [was] yet in their mouths H6310,
078:031 The wrath H0639 of God H0430 came H5927 (8804) upon them, and slew H2026 (8799) the fattest H4924 of them, and smote down H3766 (8689) the chosen H0970 [men] of Israel H3478.
078:032 For all this they sinned H2398 (8804) still, and believed H0539 (8689) not for his wondrous works H6381 (8737).
078:033 Therefore their days H3117 did he consume H3615 (8762) in vanity H1892, and their years H8141 in trouble H0928.
078:034 When he slew H2026 (8804) them, then they sought H1875 (8804) him: and they returned H7725 (8804) and enquired early H7836 (8765) after God H0410.
078:035 And they remembered H2142 (8799) that God H0430 [was] their rock H6697, and the high H5945 God H0410 their redeemer H1350 (8802).
078:036 Nevertheless they did flatter H6601 (8762) him with their mouth H6310, and they lied H3576 (8762) unto him with their tongues H3956.
078:037 For their heart H3820 was not right H3559 (8737) with him, neither were they stedfast H0539 (8738) in his covenant H1285.
078:038 But he, [being] full of compassion H7349, forgave H3722 (8762) [their] iniquity H5771, and destroyed H7843 (8686) [them] not: yea, many a time H7235 (8689) turned H7725 he his anger H0639 away H7725 (8687), and did not stir up H5782 (8686) all his wrath H2534.
078:039 For he remembered H2142 (8799) that they [were but] flesh H1320; a wind H7307 that passeth away H1980 (8802), and cometh not again H7725 (8799).
078:040 How H4100 oft did they provoke H4784 (8686) him in the wilderness H4057, [and] grieve H6087 (8686) him in the desert H3452!
078:041 Yea, they turned back H7725 (8799) and tempted H5254 (8762) God H0410, and limited H8428 (8689) the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
078:042 They remembered H2142 (8804) not his hand H3027, [nor] the day H3117 when he delivered H6299 (8804) them from the enemy H6862.
078:043 How he had wrought H7760 (8804) his signs H0226 in Egypt H4714, and his wonders H4159 in the field H7704 of Zoan H6814:
078:044 And had turned H2015 (8799) their rivers H2975 into blood H1818; and their floods H5140 (8802), that they could not drink H8354 (8799).
078:045 He sent H7971 (8762) divers sorts of flies H6157 among them, which devoured H0398 (8799) them; and frogs H6854, which destroyed H7843 (8686) them.
078:046 He gave H5414 (8799) also their increase H2981 unto the caterpiller H2625, and their labour H3018 unto the locust H0697.
078:047 He destroyed H2026 (8799) their vines H1612 with hail H1259, and their sycomore trees H8256 with frost H2602.
078:048 He gave up H5462 (8686) their cattle H1165 also to the hail H1259, and their flocks H4735 to hot thunderbolts H7565.
078:049 He cast H7971 (8762) upon them the fierceness H2740 of his anger H0639, wrath H5678, and indignation H2195, and trouble H6869, by sending H4917 evil H7451 angels H4397 [among them].
078:050 He made H6424 (8762) a way H5410 to his anger H0639; he spared H2820 (8804) not their soul H5315 from death H4194, but gave H5462 their life H2416 over H5462 (8689) to the pestilence H1698;
078:051 And smote H5221 (8686) all the firstborn H1060 in Egypt H4714; the chief H7225 of [their] strength H0202 in the tabernacles H0168 of Ham H2526:
078:052 But made his own people H5971 to go forth H5265 (8686) like sheep H6629, and guided H5090 (8762) them in the wilderness H4057 like a flock H5739.
078:053 And he led H5148 (8686) them on safely H0983, so that they feared H6342 (8804) not: but the sea H3220 overwhelmed H3680 (8765) their enemies H0341 (8802).
078:054 And he brought H0935 (8686) them to the border H1366 of his sanctuary H6944, [even to] this mountain H2022, [which] his right hand H3225 had purchased H7069 (8804).
078:055 He cast out H1644 (8762) the heathen H1471 also before H6440 them, and divided H5307 (8686) them an inheritance H5159 by line H2256, and made the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478 to dwell H7931 (8686) in their tents H0168.
078:056 Yet they tempted H5254 (8762) and provoked H4784 (8686) the most high H5945 God H0430, and kept H8104 (8804) not his testimonies H5713:
078:057 But turned back H5472 (8735), and dealt unfaithfully H0898 (8799) like their fathers H0001: they were turned aside H2015 (8738) like a deceitful H7423 bow H7198.
078:058 For they provoked him to anger H3707 (8686) with their high places H1116, and moved him to jealousy H7065 (8686) with their graven images H6456.
078:059 When God H0430 heard H8085 (8804) [this], he was wroth H5674 (8691), and greatly H3966 abhorred H3988 (8799) Israel H3478:
078:060 So that he forsook H5203 (8799) the tabernacle H4908 of Shiloh H7887, the tent H0168 [which] he placed H7931 (8765) among men H0120;
078:061 And delivered H5414 (8799) his strength H5797 into captivity H7628, and his glory H8597 into the enemy’s H6862 hand H3027.
078:062 He gave H5462 his people H5971 over H5462 (8686) also unto the sword H2719; and was wroth H5674 (8694) with his inheritance H5159.
078:063 The fire H0784 consumed H0398 (8804) their young men H0970; and their maidens H1330 were not given to marriage H1984 (8795).
078:064 Their priests H3548 fell H5307 (8804) by the sword H2719; and their widows H0490 made no lamentation H1058 (8799).
078:065 Then the Lord H0136 awaked H3364 (8799) as one out of sleep H3463, [and] like a mighty man H1368 that shouteth H7442 (8711) by reason of wine H3196.
078:066 And he smote H5221 (8686) his enemies H6862 in the hinder parts H0268: he put H5414 (8804) them to a perpetual H5769 reproach H2781.
078:067 Moreover he refused H3988 (8799) the tabernacle H0168 of Joseph H3130, and chose H0977 (8804) not the tribe H7626 of Ephraim H0669:
078:068 But chose H0977 (8799) the tribe H7626 of Judah H3063, the mount H2022 Zion H6726 which he loved H0157 (8804).
078:069 And he built H1129 (8799) his sanctuary H4720 like high H7311 (8802) [palaces], like the earth H0776 which he hath established H3245 (8804) for ever H5769.
078:070 He chose H0977 (8799) David H1732 also his servant H5650, and took H3947 (8799) him from the sheepfolds H4356 H6629:
078:071 From following H0310 the ewes great with young H5763 (8802) he brought H0935 (8689) him to feed H7462 (8800) Jacob H3290 his people H5971, and Israel H3478 his inheritance H5159.
078:072 So he fed H7462 (8686) them according to the integrity H8537 of his heart H3824; and guided H5148 (8686) them by the skilfulness H8394 of his hands H3709.
079:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of Asaph H0623.» O God H0430, the heathen H1471 are come H0935 (8804) into thine inheritance H5159; thy holy H6944 temple H1964 have they defiled H2930 (8765); they have laid H7760 (8804) Jerusalem H3389 on heaps H5856.
079:002 The dead bodies H5038 of thy servants H5650 have they given H5414 (8804) [to be] meat H3978 unto the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064, the flesh H1320 of thy saints H2623 unto the beasts H2416 of the earth H0776.
079:003 Their blood H1818 have they shed H8210 (8804) like water H4325 round about H5439 Jerusalem H3389; and [there was] none to bury H6912 (8802) [them].
079:004 We are become a reproach H2781 to our neighbours H7934, a scorn H3933 and derision H7047 to them that are round about H5439 us.
079:005 How long, LORD H3068? wilt thou be angry H0599 (8799) for ever H5331? shall thy jealousy H7068 burn H1197 (8799) like fire H0784?
079:006 Pour out H8210 (8798) thy wrath H2534 upon the heathen H1471 that have not known H3045 (8804) thee, and upon the kingdoms H4467 that have not called H7121 (8804) upon thy name H8034.
079:007 For they have devoured H0398 (8804) Jacob H3290, and laid waste H8074 (8689) his dwelling place H5116.
079:008 O remember H2142 (8799) not against us former H7223 iniquities H5771: let thy tender mercies H7356 speedily H4118 prevent H6923 (8762) us: for we are brought H1809 very H3966 low H1809 (8804).
079:009 Help H5826 (8798) us, O God H0430 of our salvation H3468, for H1697 the glory H3519 of thy name H8034: and deliver H5337 (8685) us, and purge away H3722 (8761) our sins H2403, for thy name’s H8034 sake.
079:010 Wherefore should the heathen H1471 say H0559 (8799), Where [is] their God H0430? let him be known H3045 (8735) among the heathen H1471 in our sight H5869 [by] the revenging H5360 of the blood H1818 of thy servants H5650 [which is] shed H8210 (8803).
079:011 Let the sighing H0603 of the prisoner H0615 come H0935 (8799) before H6440 thee; according to the greatness H1433 of thy power H2220 preserve H3498 (8685) thou those that are appointed H1121 to die H8546;
079:012 And render H7725 (8685) unto our neighbours H7934 sevenfold H7659 into their bosom H2436 their reproach H2781, wherewith they have reproached H2778 (8765) thee, O Lord H0136.
079:013 So we thy people H5971 and sheep H6629 of thy pasture H4830 will give thee thanks H3034 (8686) for ever H5769: we will shew forth H5608 (8762) thy praise H8416 to all H1755 generations H1755.
080:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Shoshannimeduth H7802, A Psalm H4210 of Asaph H0623.» Give ear H0238 (8685), O Shepherd H7462 (8802) of Israel H3478, thou that leadest H5090 (8802) Joseph H3130 like a flock H6629; thou that dwellest H3427 (8802) [between] the cherubims H3742, shine forth H3313 (8685).
080:002 Before H6440 Ephraim H0669 and Benjamin H1144 and Manasseh H4519 stir up H5782 (8786) thy strength H1369, and come H3212 (8798) [and] save H3444 us.
080:003 Turn us again H7725 (8685), O God H0430, and cause thy face H6440 to shine H0215 (8685); and we shall be saved H3467 (8735).
080:004 O LORD H3068 God H0430 of hosts H6635, how long wilt thou be angry H6225 (8804) against the prayer H8605 of thy people H5971?
080:005 Thou feedest H0398 (8689) them with the bread H3899 of tears H1832; and givest them tears H1832 to drink H8248 (8686) in great measure H7991.
080:006 Thou makest H7760 (8799) us a strife H4066 unto our neighbours H7934: and our enemies H0341 (8802) laugh H3932 (8799) among themselves.
080:007 Turn us again H7725 (8685), O God H0430 of hosts H6635, and cause thy face H6440 to shine H0215 (8685); and we shall be saved H3467 (8735).
080:008 Thou hast brought H5265 (8686) a vine H1612 out of Egypt H4714: thou hast cast out H1644 (8762) the heathen H1471, and planted H5193 (8799) it.
080:009 Thou preparedst H6437 (8765) [room] before H6440 it, and didst cause it to take deep H8328 root H8327 (8686), and it filled H4390 (8762) the land H0776.
080:010 The hills H2022 were covered H3680 (8795) with the shadow H6738 of it, and the boughs H6057 thereof [were like] the goodly H0410 cedars H0730.
080:011 She sent out H7971 (8762) her boughs H7105 unto the sea H3220, and her branches H3127 unto the river H5104.
080:012 Why hast thou [then] broken down H6555 (8804) her hedges H1447, so that all they which pass H5674 (8802) by the way H1870 do pluck H0717 (8804) her?
080:013 The boar H2386 out of the wood H3293 doth waste H3765 (8762) it, and the wild beast H2123 of the field H7704 doth devour H7462 (8799) it.
080:014 Return H7725 (8798), we beseech thee, O God H0430 of hosts H6635: look down H5027 (8685) from heaven H8064, and behold H7200 (8798), and visit H6485 (8798) this vine H1612;
080:015 And the vineyard H3657 H3661 (8798) which thy right hand H3225 hath planted H5193 (8804), and the branch H1121 [that] thou madest strong H0553 (8765) for thyself.
080:016 [It is] burned H8313 (8803) with fire H0784, [it is] cut down H3683 (8803): they perish H0006 (8799) at the rebuke H1606 of thy countenance H6440.
080:017 Let thy hand H3027 be upon the man H0376 of thy right hand H3225, upon the son H1121 of man H0120 [whom] thou madest strong H0553 (8765) for thyself.
080:018 So will not we go back H5472 (8799) from thee: quicken H2421 (8762) us, and we will call H7121 (8799) upon thy name H8034.
080:019 Turn us again H7725 (8685), O LORD H3068 God H0430 of hosts H6635, cause thy face H6440 to shine H0215 (8685); and we shall be saved H3467 (8735).
081:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Gittith H1665, [A Psalm] of Asaph H0623.» Sing aloud H7442 (8685) unto God H0430 our strength H5797: make a joyful noise H7321 (8685) unto the God H0430 of Jacob H3290.
081:002 Take H5375 (8798) a psalm H2172, and bring H5414 (8798) hither the timbrel H8596, the pleasant H5273 harp H3658 with the psaltery H5035.
081:003 Blow up H8628 (8798) the trumpet H7782 in the new moon H2320, in the time appointed H3677, on our solemn feast H2282 day H3117.
081:004 For this [was] a statute H2706 for Israel H3478, [and] a law H4941 of the God H0430 of Jacob H3290.
081:005 This he ordained H7760 (8804) in Joseph H3084 [for] a testimony H5715, when he went out H3318 (8800) through the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: [where] I heard H8085 (8799) a language H8193 [that] I understood H3045 (8804) not.
081:006 I removed H5493 (8689) his shoulder H7926 from the burden H5447: his hands H3709 were delivered H5674 (8799) from the pots H1731.
081:007 Thou calledst H7121 (8804) in trouble H6869, and I delivered H2502 (8762) thee; I answered H6030 (8799) thee in the secret place H5643 of thunder H7482: I proved H0974 (8799) thee at the waters H4325 of Meribah H4809. Selah H5542.
081:008 Hear H8085 (8798), O my people H5971, and I will testify H5749 (8686) unto thee: O Israel H3478, if thou wilt hearken H8085 (8799) unto me;
081:009 There shall no strange H2114 (8801) god H0410 be in thee; neither shalt thou worship H7812 (8691) any strange H5236 god H0410.
081:010 I [am] the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, which brought H5927 (8688) thee out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: open thy mouth H6310 wide H7337 (8685), and I will fill H4390 (8762) it.
081:011 But my people H5971 would not hearken H8085 (8804) to my voice H6963; and Israel H3478 would H0014 (8804) none of me.
081:012 So I gave them up H7971 (8762) unto their own hearts H3820 ’ lust H8307: [and] they walked H3212 (8799) in their own counsels H4156.
081:013 Oh H3863 that my people H5971 had hearkened H8085 (8802) unto me, [and] Israel H3478 had walked H1980 (8762) in my ways H1870!
081:014 I should soon H4592 have subdued H3665 (8686) their enemies H0341 (8802), and turned H7725 (8686) my hand H3027 against their adversaries H6862.
081:015 The haters H8130 (8764) of the LORD H3068 should have submitted H3584 (8762) themselves unto him: but their time H6256 should have endured for ever H5769.
081:016 He should have fed H0398 (8686) them also with the finest H2459 of the wheat H2406: and with honey H1706 out of the rock H6697 should I have satisfied H7646 (8686) thee.
082:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of Asaph H0623.» God H0430 standeth H5324 (8737) in the congregation H5712 of the mighty H0410; he judgeth H8199 (8799) among H7130 the gods H0430.
082:002 How long will ye judge H8199 (8799) unjustly H5766, and accept H5375 (8799) the persons H6440 of the wicked H7563? Selah H5542.
082:003 Defend H8199 (8798) the poor H1800 and fatherless H3490: do justice H6663 (8685) to the afflicted H6041 and needy H7326 (8802).
082:004 Deliver H6403 (8761) the poor H1800 and needy H0034: rid H5337 (8685) [them] out of the hand H3027 of the wicked H7563.
082:005 They know H3045 (8804) not, neither will they understand H0995 (8799); they walk H1980 (8691) on in darkness H2825: all the foundations H4144 of the earth H0776 are out of course H4131 (8735).
082:006 I have said H0559 (8804), Ye [are] gods H0430; and all of you [are] children H1121 of the most High H5945.
082:007 But H0403 ye shall die H4191 (8799) like men H0120, and fall H5307 (8799) like one H0259 of the princes H8269.
082:008 Arise H6965 (8798), O God H0430, judge H8199 (8798) the earth H0776: for thou shalt inherit H5157 (8799) all nations H1471.
083:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 [or] Psalm H4210 of Asaph H0623.» Keep not thou silence H1824, O God H0430: hold not thy peace H2790 (8799), and be not still H8252 (8799), O God H0410.
083:002 For, lo, thine enemies H0341 (8802) make a tumult H1993 (8799): and they that hate H8130 (8764) thee have lifted up H5375 (8804) the head H7218.
083:003 They have taken crafty H6191 (8686) counsel H5475 against thy people H5971, and consulted H3289 (8691) against thy hidden ones H6845 (8803).
083:004 They have said H0559 (8804), Come H3212 (8798), and let us cut them off H3582 (8686) from [being] a nation H1471; that the name H8034 of Israel H3478 may be no more in remembrance H2142 (8735).
083:005 For they have consulted H3289 (8738) together H3162 with one consent H3820: they are H3772 (8799) confederate H1285 against thee:
083:006 The tabernacles H0168 of Edom H0123, and the Ishmaelites H3459; of Moab H4124, and the Hagarenes H1905;
083:007 Gebal H1381, and Ammon H5983, and Amalek H6002; the Philistines H6429 with the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Tyre H6865;
083:008 Assur H0804 also is joined H3867 (8738) with them: they have holpen H2220 the children H1121 of Lot H3876. Selah H5542.
083:009 Do H6213 (8798) unto them as [unto] the Midianites H4080; as [to] Sisera H5516, as [to] Jabin H2985, at the brook H5158 of Kison H7028:
083:010 [Which] perished H8045 (8738) at Endor H5874: they became [as] dung H1828 for the earth H0127.
083:011 Make H7896 (8798) their nobles H5081 like Oreb H6159, and like Zeeb H2062: yea, all their princes H5257 as Zebah H2078, and as Zalmunna H6759:
083:012 Who said H0559 (8804), Let us take to ourselves the houses H4999 of God H0430 in possession H3423 (8799).
083:013 O my God H0430, make H7896 (8798) them like a wheel H1534; as the stubble H7179 before H6440 the wind H7307.
083:014 As the fire H0784 burneth H1197 (8799) a wood H3293, and as the flame H3852 setteth H3857 the mountains H2022 on fire H3857 (8762);
083:015 So persecute H7291 (8799) them with thy tempest H5591, and make them afraid H0926 (8762) with thy storm H5492.
083:016 Fill H4390 (8761) their faces H6440 with shame H7036; that they may seek H1245 (8762) thy name H8034, O LORD H3068.
083:017 Let them be confounded H0954 (8799) and troubled H0926 (8735) for ever H5703; yea, let them be put to shame H2659 (8799), and perish H0006 (8799):
083:018 That [men] may know H3045 (8799) that thou, whose name H8034 alone [is] JEHOVAH H3068, [art] the most high H5945 over all the earth H0776.
084:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Gittith H1665, A Psalm H4210 for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141.» How amiable H3039 [are] thy tabernacles H4908, O LORD H3068 of hosts H6635!
084:002 My soul H5315 longeth H3700 (8738), yea, even fainteth H3615 (8804) for the courts H2691 of the LORD H3068: my heart H3820 and my flesh H1320 crieth out H7442 (8762) for the living H2416 God H0410.
084:003 Yea, the sparrow H6833 hath found H4672 (8804) an house H1004, and the swallow H1866 a nest H7064 for herself, where she may lay H7896 (8804) her young H0667, [even] thine altars H4196, O LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, my King H4428, and my God H0430.
084:004 Blessed H0835 [are] they that dwell H3427 (8802) in thy house H1004: they will be still praising H1984 (8762) thee. Selah H5542.
084:005 Blessed H0835 [is] the man H0120 whose strength H5797 [is] in thee; in whose heart H3824 [are] the ways H4546 [of them].
084:006 [Who] passing H5674 (8802) through the valley H6010 of Baca H1056 (8676) H1057 make H7896 (8799) it a well H4599; the rain H4175 also filleth H5844 (8799) the pools H1293.
084:007 They go H3212 (8799) from strength H2428 to strength H2428, [every one of them] in Zion H6726 appeareth H7200 (8735) before God H0430.
084:008 O LORD H3068 God H0430 of hosts H6635, hear H8085 (8798) my prayer H8605: give ear H0238 (8685), O God H0430 of Jacob H3290. Selah H5542.
084:009 Behold H7200 (8798), O God H0430 our shield H4043, and look H5027 (8685) upon the face H6440 of thine anointed H4899.
084:010 For a day H3117 in thy courts H2691 [is] better H2896 than a thousand H0505. I had rather H0977 (8804) be a doorkeeper H5605 (8705) in the house H1004 of my God H0430, than to dwell H1752 (8800) in the tents H0168 of wickedness H7562.
084:011 For the LORD H3068 God H0430 [is] a sun H8121 and shield H4043: the LORD H3068 will give H5414 (8799) grace H2580 and glory H3519: no good H2896 [thing] will he withhold H4513 (8799) from them that walk H1980 (8802) uprightly H8549.
084:012 O LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, blessed H0835 [is] the man H0120 that trusteth H0982 (8802) in thee.
085:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141.» LORD H3068, thou hast been favourable H7521 (8804) unto thy land H0776: thou hast brought back H7725 (8804) the captivity H7622 (8675) H7622 of Jacob H3290.
085:002 Thou hast forgiven H5375 (8804) the iniquity H5771 of thy people H5971, thou hast covered H3680 (8765) all their sin H2403. Selah H5542.
085:003 Thou hast taken away H0622 (8804) all thy wrath H5678: thou hast turned H7725 (8689) [thyself] from the fierceness H2740 of thine anger H0639.
085:004 Turn H7725 (8798) us, O God H0430 of our salvation H3468, and cause thine anger H3708 toward us to cease H6565 (8685).
085:005 Wilt thou be angry H0599 (8799) with us for ever H5769? wilt thou draw out H4900 (8799) thine anger H0639 to all H1755 generations H1755?
085:006 Wilt thou not revive H2421 (8762) us again H7725 (8799): that thy people H5971 may rejoice H8055 (8799) in thee?
085:007 Shew H7200 (8685) us thy mercy H2617, O LORD H3068, and grant H5414 (8799) us thy salvation H3468.
085:008 I will hear H8085 (8799) what God H0410 the LORD H3068 will speak H1696 (8762): for he will speak H1696 (8762) peace H7965 unto his people H5971, and to his saints H2623: but let them not turn again H7725 (8799) to folly H3690.
085:009 Surely his salvation H3468 [is] nigh H7138 them that fear H3373 him; that glory H3519 may dwell H7931 (8800) in our land H0776.
085:010 Mercy H2617 and truth H0571 are met together H6298 (8738); righteousness H6664 and peace H7965 have kissed H5401 (8804) [each other].
085:011 Truth H0571 shall spring out H6779 (8799) of the earth H0776; and righteousness H6664 shall look down H8259 (8738) from heaven H8064.
085:012 Yea, the LORD H3068 shall give H5414 (8799) [that which is] good H2896; and our land H0776 shall yield H5414 (8799) her increase H2981.
085:013 Righteousness H6664 shall go H1980 (8762) before H6440 him; and shall set H7760 (8799) [us] in the way H1870 of his steps H6471.
086:001 ¶  «A Prayer H8605 of David H1732.» Bow down H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241, O LORD H3068, hear H6030 (8798) me: for I [am] poor H6041 and needy H0034.
086:002 Preserve H8104 (8798) my soul H5315; for I [am] holy H2623: O thou my God H0430, save H3467 (8685) thy servant H5650 that trusteth H0982 (8802) in thee.
086:003 Be merciful H2603 (8798) unto me, O Lord H0136: for I cry H7121 (8799) unto thee daily H3117.
086:004 Rejoice H8055 (8761) the soul H5315 of thy servant H5650: for unto thee, O Lord H0136, do I lift up H5375 (8799) my soul H5315.
086:005 For thou, Lord H0136, [art] good H2896, and ready to forgive H5546; and plenteous H7227 in mercy H2617 unto all them that call H7121 (8802) upon thee.
086:006 Give ear H0238 (8685), O LORD H3068, unto my prayer H8605; and attend H7181 (8685) to the voice H6963 of my supplications H8469.
086:007 In the day H3117 of my trouble H6869 I will call H7121 (8799) upon thee: for thou wilt answer H6030 (8799) me.
086:008 Among the gods H0430 [there is] none like unto thee, O Lord H0136; neither [are there any works] like unto thy works H4639.
086:009 All nations H1471 whom thou hast made H6213 (8804) shall come H0935 (8799) and worship H7812 (8691) before H6440 thee, O Lord H0136; and shall glorify H3513 (8762) thy name H8034.
086:010 For thou [art] great H1419, and doest H6213 (8802) wondrous things H6381 (8737): thou [art] God H0430 alone.
086:011 Teach H3384 (8685) me thy way H1870, O LORD H3068; I will walk H1980 (8762) in thy truth H0571: unite H3161 (8761) my heart H3824 to fear H3372 (8800) thy name H8034.
086:012 I will praise H3034 (8686) thee, O Lord H0136 my God H0430, with all my heart H3824: and I will glorify H3513 (8762) thy name H8034 for evermore H5769.
086:013 For great H1419 [is] thy mercy H2617 toward me: and thou hast delivered H5337 (8689) my soul H5315 from the lowest H8482 hell H7585.
086:014 O God H0430, the proud H2086 are risen H6965 (8804) against me, and the assemblies H5712 of violent H6184 [men] have sought H1245 (8765) after my soul H5315; and have not set H7760 (8804) thee before them.
086:015 But thou, O Lord H0136, [art] a God H0410 full of compassion H7349, and gracious H2587, longsuffering H0750 H0639, and plenteous H7227 in mercy H2617 and truth H0571.
086:016 O turn H6437 (8798) unto me, and have mercy H2603 (8798) upon me; give H5414 (8798) thy strength H5797 unto thy servant H5650, and save H3467 (8685) the son H1121 of thine handmaid H0519.
086:017 Shew H6213 (8798) me a token H0226 for good H2896; that they which hate H8130 (8802) me may see H7200 (8799) [it], and be ashamed H0954 (8799): because thou, LORD H3068, hast holpen H5826 (8804) me, and comforted H5162 (8765) me.
087:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 [or] Song H7892 for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141.» His foundation H3248 [is] in the holy H6944 mountains H2042.
087:002 The LORD H3068 loveth H0157 (8802) the gates H8179 of Zion H6726 more than all the dwellings H4908 of Jacob H3290.
087:003 Glorious things H3513 (8737) are spoken H1696 (8794) of thee, O city H5892 of God H0430. Selah H5542.
087:004 I will make mention H2142 (8686) of Rahab H7294 and Babylon H0894 to them that know H3045 (8802) me: behold Philistia H6429, and Tyre H6865, with Ethiopia H3568; this [man] was born H3205 (8795) there.
087:005 And of Zion H6726 it shall be said H0559 (8735), This and that man H0376 was born H3205 (8795) in her: and the highest H5945 himself shall establish H3559 (8787) her.
087:006 The LORD H3068 shall count H5608 (8799), when he writeth up H3789 (8800) the people H5971, [that] this [man] was born H3205 (8795) there. Selah H5542.
087:007 As well the singers H7891 (8802) as the players H2490 (8802) on instruments [shall be there]: all my springs H4599 [are] in thee.
088:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 [or] Psalm H4210 for the sons H1121 of Korah H7141, to the chief Musician H5329 (8764) upon Mahalath H4257 Leannoth H6031 (8763), Maschil H4905 (8688) of Heman H1968 the Ezrahite H0250.» O LORD H3068 God H0430 of my salvation H3444, I have cried H6817 (8804) day H3117 [and] night H3915 before thee:
088:002 Let my prayer H8605 come H0935 (8799) before H6440 thee: incline H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241 unto my cry H7440;
088:003 For my soul H5315 is full H7646 (8804) of troubles H7451: and my life H2416 draweth nigh H5060 (8689) unto the grave H7585.
088:004 I am counted H2803 (8738) with them that go down H3381 (8802) into the pit H0953: I am as a man H1397 [that hath] no strength H0353:
088:005 Free H2670 among the dead H4191 (8801), like the slain H2491 that lie H7901 (8802) in the grave H6913, whom thou rememberest H2142 (8804) no more: and they are cut off H1504 (8738) from thy hand H3027.
088:006 Thou hast laid H7896 (8804) me in the lowest H8482 pit H0953, in darkness H4285, in the deeps H4688.
088:007 Thy wrath H2534 lieth hard H5564 (8804) upon me, and thou hast afflicted H6031 (8765) [me] with all thy waves H4867. Selah H5542.
088:008 Thou hast put away H7368 mine acquaintance H3045 (8794) far H7368 (8689) from me; thou hast made H7896 (8804) me an abomination H8441 unto them: [I am] shut up H3607 (8803), and I cannot come forth H3318 (8799).
088:009 Mine eye H5869 mourneth H1669 (8804) by reason of affliction H6040: LORD H3068, I have called H7121 (8804) daily H3117 upon thee, I have stretched out H7849 (8765) my hands H3709 unto thee.
088:010 Wilt thou shew H6213 (8799) wonders H6382 to the dead H4191 (8801)? shall the dead H7496 arise H6965 (8799) [and] praise H3034 (8686) thee? Selah H5542.
088:011 Shall thy lovingkindness H2617 be declared H5608 (8792) in the grave H6913? [or] thy faithfulness H0530 in destruction H0011?
088:012 Shall thy wonders H6382 be known H3045 (8735) in the dark H2822? and thy righteousness H6666 in the land H0776 of forgetfulness H5388?
088:013 But unto thee have I cried H7768 (8765), O LORD H3068; and in the morning H1242 shall my prayer H8605 prevent H6923 (8762) thee.
088:014 LORD H3068, why castest thou off H2186 (8799) my soul H5315? [why] hidest H5641 (8686) thou thy face H6440 from me?
088:015 I [am] afflicted H6041 and ready to die H1478 (8802) from [my] youth H5290 up: [while] I suffer H5375 (8804) thy terrors H0367 I am distracted H6323 (8799).
088:016 Thy fierce wrath H2740 goeth over H5674 (8804) me; thy terrors H1161 have cut me off H6789 (8768).
088:017 They came round about H5437 (8804) me daily H3117 like water H4325; they compassed H5362 (8689) me about together H3162.
088:018 Lover H0157 (8802) and friend H7453 hast thou put far H7368 (8689) from me, [and] mine acquaintance H3045 (8794) into darkness H4285.
089:001 ¶  «Maschil H4905 (8688) of Ethan H0387 the Ezrahite H0250.» I will sing H7891 (8799) of the mercies H2617 of the LORD H3068 for ever H5769: with my mouth H6310 will I make known H3045 (8686) thy faithfulness H0530 to all H1755 generations H1755.
089:002 For I have said H0559 (8804), Mercy H2617 shall be built up H1129 (8735) for ever H5769: thy faithfulness H0530 shalt thou establish H3559 (8686) in the very heavens H8064.
089:003 I have made H3772 (8804) a covenant H1285 with my chosen H0972, I have sworn H7650 (8738) unto David H1732 my servant H5650,
089:004 Thy seed H2233 will I establish H3559 (8686) for H5704 ever H5769, and build up H1129 (8804) thy throne H3678 to all H1755 generations H1755. Selah H5542.
089:005 And the heavens H8064 shall praise H3034 (8686) thy wonders H6382, O LORD H3068: thy faithfulness H0530 also in the congregation H6951 of the saints H6918.
089:006 For who in the heaven H7834 can be compared H6186 (8799) unto the LORD H3068? [who] among the sons H1121 of the mighty H0410 can be likened H1819 (8799) unto the LORD H3068?
089:007 God H0410 is greatly H7227 to be feared H6206 (8737) in the assembly H5475 of the saints H6918, and to be had in reverence H3372 (8737) of all [them that are] about H5439 him.
089:008 O LORD H3068 God H0430 of hosts H6635, who [is] a strong H2626 LORD H3050 like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness H0530 round about H5439 thee?
089:009 Thou rulest H4910 (8802) the raging H1348 of the sea H3220: when the waves H1530 thereof arise H7721 (8800), thou stillest H7623 (8762) them.
089:010 Thou hast broken H1792 Rahab H7294 in pieces H1792 (8765), as one that is slain H2491; thou hast scattered H6340 (8765) thine enemies H0341 (8802) with thy strong H5797 arm H2220.
089:011 The heavens H8064 [are] thine, the earth H0776 also [is] thine: [as for] the world H8398 and the fulness H4393 thereof, thou hast founded H3245 (8804) them.
089:012 The north H6828 and the south H3225 thou hast created H1254 (8804) them: Tabor H8396 and Hermon H2768 shall rejoice H7442 (8762) in thy name H8034.
089:013 Thou hast a mighty H1369 arm H2220: strong H5810 (8799) is thy hand H3027, [and] high H7311 (8799) is thy right hand H3225.
089:014 Justice H6664 and judgment H4941 [are] the habitation H4349 of thy throne H3678: mercy H2617 and truth H0571 shall go H6923 (8762) before thy face H6440.
089:015 Blessed H0835 [is] the people H5971 that know H3045 (8802) the joyful sound H8643: they shall walk H1980 (8762), O LORD H3068, in the light H0216 of thy countenance H6440.
089:016 In thy name H8034 shall they rejoice H1523 (8799) all the day H3117: and in thy righteousness H6666 shall they be exalted H7311 (8799).
089:017 For thou [art] the glory H8597 of their strength H5797: and in thy favour H7522 our horn H7161 shall be exalted H7311 (8799) (8675) H7311 (8686).
089:018 For the LORD H3068 [is] our defence H4043; and the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478 [is] our king H4428.
089:019 Then thou spakest H1696 (8765) in vision H2377 to thy holy one H2623, and saidst H0559 (8799), I have laid H7737 (8765) help H5828 upon [one that is] mighty H1368; I have exalted H7311 (8689) [one] chosen H0977 (8803) out of the people H5971.
089:020 I have found H4672 (8804) David H1732 my servant H5650; with my holy H6944 oil H8081 have I anointed H4886 (8804) him:
089:021 With whom my hand H3027 shall be established H3559 (8735): mine arm H2220 also shall strengthen H0553 (8762) him.
089:022 The enemy H0341 (8802) shall not exact H5378 (8686) upon him; nor the son H1121 of wickedness H5766 afflict H6031 (8762) him.
089:023 And I will beat down H3807 (8804) his foes H6862 before his face H6440, and plague H5062 (8799) them that hate H8130 (8764) him.
089:024 But my faithfulness H0530 and my mercy H2617 [shall be] with him: and in my name H8034 shall his horn H7161 be exalted H7311 (8799).
089:025 I will set H7760 (8804) his hand H3027 also in the sea H3220, and his right hand H3225 in the rivers H5104.
089:026 He shall cry H7121 (8799) unto me, Thou [art] my father H0001, my God H0410, and the rock H6697 of my salvation H3444.
089:027 Also I will make H5414 (8799) him [my] firstborn H1060, higher H5945 than the kings H4428 of the earth H0776.
089:028 My mercy H2617 will I keep H8104 (8799) for him for evermore H5769, and my covenant H1285 shall stand fast H0539 (8737) with him.
089:029 His seed H2233 also will I make H7760 (8804) [to endure] for ever H5703, and his throne H3678 as the days H3117 of heaven H8064.
089:030 If his children H1121 forsake H5800 (8799) my law H8451, and walk H3212 (8799) not in my judgments H4941;
089:031 If they break H2490 (8762) my statutes H2708, and keep H8104 (8799) not my commandments H4687;
089:032 Then will I visit H6485 (8804) their transgression H6588 with the rod H7626, and their iniquity H5771 with stripes H5061.
089:033 Nevertheless my lovingkindness H2617 will I not utterly take H6331 (8686) from him, nor suffer my faithfulness H0530 to fail H8266 (8762).
089:034 My covenant H1285 will I not break H2490 (8762), nor alter H8138 (8762) the thing that is gone out H4161 of my lips H8193.
089:035 Once H0259 have I sworn H7650 (8738) by my holiness H6944 that I will not lie H3576 (8762) unto David H1732.
089:036 His seed H2233 shall endure for ever H5769, and his throne H3678 as the sun H8121 before me.
089:037 It shall be established H3559 (8735) for ever H5769 as the moon H3394, and [as] a faithful H0539 (8737) witness H5707 in heaven H7834. Selah H5542.
089:038 But thou hast cast off H2186 (8804) and abhorred H3988 (8799), thou hast been wroth H5674 (8694) with thine anointed H4899.
089:039 Thou hast made void H5010 (8765) the covenant H1285 of thy servant H5650: thou hast profaned H2490 (8765) his crown H5145 [by casting it] to the ground H0776.
089:040 Thou hast broken down H6555 (8804) all his hedges H1448; thou hast brought H7760 (8804) his strong holds H4013 to ruin H4288.
089:041 All that pass by H5674 (8802) the way H1870 spoil H8155 (8804) him: he is a reproach H2781 to his neighbours H7934.
089:042 Thou hast set up H7311 (8689) the right hand H3225 of his adversaries H6862; thou hast made all his enemies H0341 (8802) to rejoice H8055 (8689).
089:043 Thou hast also turned H7725 (8686) the edge H6697 of his sword H2719, and hast not made him to stand H6965 (8689) in the battle H4421.
089:044 Thou hast made his glory H2892 to cease H7673 (8689), and cast H4048 his throne H3678 down H4048 (8765) to the ground H0776.
089:045 The days H3117 of his youth H5934 hast thou shortened H7114 (8689): thou hast covered H5844 (8689) him with shame H0955. Selah H5542.
089:046 How long, LORD H3068? wilt thou hide H5641 (8735) thyself for ever H5331? shall thy wrath H2534 burn H1197 (8799) like fire H0784?
089:047 Remember H2142 (8798) how short H2465 my time is: wherefore hast thou made H1254 (8804) all men H1121 H0120 in vain H7723?
089:048 What man H1397 [is he that] liveth H2421 (8799), and shall not see H7200 (8799) death H4194? shall he deliver H4422 (8762) his soul H5315 from the hand H3027 of the grave H7585? Selah H5542.
089:049 Lord H0136, where [are] thy former H7223 lovingkindnesses H2617, [which] thou swarest H7650 (8738) unto David H1732 in thy truth H0530?
089:050 Remember H2142 (8798), Lord H0136, the reproach H2781 of thy servants H5650; [how] I do bear H5375 (8800) in my bosom H2436 [the reproach of] all the mighty H7227 people H5971;
089:051 Wherewith thine enemies H0341 (8802) have reproached H2778 (8765), O LORD H3068; wherewith they have reproached H2778 (8765) the footsteps H6119 of thine anointed H4899.
089:052 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 for evermore H5769. Amen H0543, and Amen H0543.
090:001 ¶  «A Prayer H8605 of Moses H4872 the man H0376 of God H0430.» Lord H0136, thou hast been our dwelling place H4583 in all H1755 generations H1755.
090:002 Before the mountains H2022 were brought forth H3205 (8795), or ever thou hadst formed H2342 (8787) the earth H0776 and the world H8398, even from everlasting H5769 to H5704 everlasting H5769, thou [art] God H0410.
090:003 Thou turnest H7725 (8686) man H0582 to destruction H1793; and sayest H0559 (8799), Return H7725 (8798), ye children H1121 of men H0120.
090:004 For a thousand H0505 years H8141 in thy sight H5869 [are but] as H3117 yesterday H0865 when it is past H5674 (8799), and [as] a watch H0821 in the night H3915.
090:005 Thou carriest them away as with a flood H2229 (8804); they are [as] a sleep H8142: in the morning H1242 [they are] like grass H2682 [which] groweth up H2498 (8799).
090:006 In the morning H1242 it flourisheth H6692 (8686), and groweth up H2498 (8804); in the evening H6153 it is cut down H4135 (8787), and withereth H3001 (8804).
090:007 For we are consumed H3615 (8804) by thine anger H0639, and by thy wrath H2534 are we troubled H0926 (8738).
090:008 Thou hast set H7896 (8804) our iniquities H5771 before thee, our secret H5956 (8803) [sins] in the light H3974 of thy countenance H6440.
090:009 For all our days H3117 are passed away H6437 (8804) in thy wrath H5678: we spend H3615 (8765) our years H8141 as a tale H1899 [that is told].
090:010 The days H3117 of our years H8141 [are] threescore H7657 years H8141 and ten H7657; and if by reason of strength H1369 [they be] fourscore H8084 years H8141, yet [is] their strength H7296 labour H5999 and sorrow H0205; for it is soon H2440 cut off H1468 (8804), and we fly away H5774 (8799).
090:011 Who knoweth H3045 (8802) the power H5797 of thine anger H0639? even according to thy fear H3374, [so is] thy wrath H5678.
090:012 So teach H3045 (8685) [us] to number H4487 (8800) our days H3117, that we may apply H0935 (8686) [our] hearts H3824 unto wisdom H2451.
090:013 Return H7725 (8798), O LORD H3068, how long? and let it repent H5162 (8734) thee concerning thy servants H5650.
090:014 O satisfy H7646 (8761) us early H1242 with thy mercy H2617; that we may rejoice H7442 (8762) and be glad H8055 (8799) all our days H3117.
090:015 Make us glad H8055 (8761) according to the days H3117 [wherein] thou hast afflicted H6031 (8765) us, [and] the years H8141 [wherein] we have seen H7200 (8804) evil H7451.
090:016 Let thy work H6467 appear H7200 (8735) unto thy servants H5650, and thy glory H1926 unto their children H1121.
090:017 And let the beauty H5278 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430 be upon us: and establish H3559 (8786) thou the work H4639 of our hands H3027 upon us; yea, the work H4639 of our hands H3027 establish H3559 (8786) thou it.
091:001 ¶  He that dwelleth H3427 (8802) in the secret H5643 place of the most High H5945 shall abide H3885 (8698) under the shadow H6738 of the Almighty H7706.
091:002 I will say H0559 (8799) of the LORD H3068, [He is] my refuge H4268 and my fortress H4686: my God H0430; in him will I trust H0982 (8799).
091:003 Surely he shall deliver H5337 (8686) thee from the snare H6341 of the fowler H3353, [and] from the noisome H1942 pestilence H1698.
091:004 He shall cover H5526 (8686) thee with his feathers H0084, and under his wings H3671 shalt thou trust H2620 (8799): his truth H0571 [shall be thy] shield H6793 and buckler H5507.
091:005 Thou shalt not be afraid H3372 (8799) for the terror H6343 by night H3915; [nor] for the arrow H2671 [that] flieth H5774 (8799) by day H3119;
091:006 [Nor] for the pestilence H1698 [that] walketh H1980 (8799) in darkness H0652; [nor] for the destruction H6986 [that] wasteth H7736 (8799) at noonday H6672.
091:007 A thousand H0505 shall fall H5307 (8799) at thy side H6654, and ten thousand H7233 at thy right hand H3225; [but] it shall not come nigh H5066 (8799) thee.
091:008 Only with thine eyes H5869 shalt thou behold H5027 (8686) and see H7200 (8799) the reward H8011 of the wicked H7563.
091:009 Because thou hast made H7760 (8804) the LORD H3068, [which is] my refuge H4268, [even] the most High H5945, thy habitation H4583;
091:010 There shall no evil H7451 befall H0579 (8792) thee, neither shall any plague H5061 come nigh H7126 (8799) thy dwelling H0168.
091:011 For he shall give his angels H4397 charge H6680 (8762) over thee, to keep H8104 (8800) thee in all thy ways H1870.
091:012 They shall bear thee up H5375 (8799) in [their] hands H3709, lest thou dash H5062 (8799) thy foot H7272 against a stone H0068.
091:013 Thou shalt tread H1869 (8799) upon the lion H7826 and adder H6620: the young lion H3715 and the dragon H8577 shalt thou trample under feet H7429 (8799).
091:014 Because he hath set his love H2836 (8804) upon me, therefore will I deliver H6403 (8762) him: I will set him on high H7682 (8762), because he hath known H3045 (8804) my name H8034.
091:015 He shall call H7121 (8799) upon me, and I will answer H6030 (8799) him: I [will be] with him in trouble H6869; I will deliver H2502 (8762) him, and honour H3513 (8762) him.
091:016 With long H0753 life H3117 will I satisfy H7646 (8686) him, and shew H7200 (8686) him my salvation H3444.
092:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 [or] Song H7892 for the sabbath H7676 day H3117.» [It is a] good H2896 [thing] to give thanks H3034 (8687) unto the LORD H3068, and to sing praises H2167 (8763) unto thy name H8034, O most High H5945:
092:002 To shew forth H5046 (8687) thy lovingkindness H2617 in the morning H1242, and thy faithfulness H0530 every night H3915,
092:003 Upon an instrument of ten strings H6218, and upon the psaltery H5035; upon the harp H3658 with a solemn sound H1902.
092:004 For thou, LORD H3068, hast made me glad H8055 (8765) through thy work H6467: I will triumph H7442 (8762) in the works H4639 of thy hands H3027.
092:005 O LORD H3068, how great H1431 (8804) are thy works H4639! [and] thy thoughts H4284 are very H3966 deep H6009 (8804).
092:006 A brutish H1198 man H0376 knoweth H3045 (8799) not; neither doth a fool H3684 understand H0995 (8799) this.
092:007 When the wicked H7563 spring H6524 (8800) as the grass H6212, and when all the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205 do flourish H6692 (8686); [it is] that they shall be destroyed H8045 (8736) for ever H5703:
092:008 But thou, LORD H3068, [art most] high H4791 for evermore H5769.
092:009 For, lo, thine enemies H0341 (8802), O LORD H3068, for, lo, thine enemies H0341 (8802) shall perish H0006 (8799); all the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205 shall be scattered H6504 (8691).
092:010 But my horn H7161 shalt thou exalt H7311 (8686) like [the horn of] an unicorn H7214: I shall be anointed H1101 (8804) with fresh H7488 oil H8081.
092:011 Mine eye H5869 also shall see H5027 (8686) [my desire] on mine enemies H7790, [and] mine ears H0241 shall hear H8085 (8799) [my desire] of the wicked H7489 (8688) that rise up H6965 (8801) against me.
092:012 The righteous H6662 shall flourish H6524 (8799) like the palm tree H8558: he shall grow H7685 (8799) like a cedar H0730 in Lebanon H3844.
092:013 Those that be planted H8362 (8803) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 shall flourish H6524 (8686) in the courts H2691 of our God H0430.
092:014 They shall still bring forth fruit H5107 (8799) in old age H7872; they shall be fat H1879 and flourishing H7488;
092:015 To shew H5046 (8687) that the LORD H3068 [is] upright H3477: [he is] my rock H6697, and [there is] no unrighteousness H5766 (8675) H5766 in him.
093:001 ¶  The LORD H3068 reigneth H4427 (8804), he is clothed H3847 (8804) with majesty H1348; the LORD H3068 is clothed H3847 (8804) with strength H5797, [wherewith] he hath girded H0247 (8694) himself: the world H8398 also is stablished H3559 (8735), that it cannot be moved H4131 (8735).
093:002 Thy throne H3678 [is] established H3559 (8737) of old H0227: thou [art] from everlasting H5769.
093:003 The floods H5104 have lifted up H5375 (8804), O LORD H3068, the floods H5104 have lifted up H5375 (8804) their voice H6963; the floods H5104 lift up H5375 (8799) their waves H1796.
093:004 The LORD H3068 on high H4791 [is] mightier H0117 than the noise H6963 of many H7227 waters H4325, [yea, than] the mighty H0117 waves H4867 of the sea H3220.
093:005 Thy testimonies H5713 are very H3966 sure H0539 (8738): holiness H6944 becometh H4998 (8773) thine house H1004, O LORD H3068, for ever H0753 H3117.
094:001 ¶  O LORD H3068 God H0410, to whom vengeance H5360 belongeth; O God H0410, to whom vengeance H5360 belongeth, shew H3313 (8685) thyself.
094:002 Lift up H5375 (8734) thyself, thou judge H8199 (8802) of the earth H0776: render H7725 (8685) a reward H1576 to the proud H1343.
094:003 LORD H3068, how long shall the wicked H7563, how long shall the wicked H7563 triumph H5937 (8799)?
094:004 [How long] shall they utter H5042 (8686) [and] speak H1696 (8762) hard things H6277? [and] all the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205 boast H0559 (8691) themselves?
094:005 They break in pieces H1792 (8762) thy people H5971, O LORD H3068, and afflict H6031 (8762) thine heritage H5159.
094:006 They slay H2026 (8799) the widow H0490 and the stranger H1616, and murder H7523 (8762) the fatherless H3490.
094:007 Yet they say H0559 (8799), The LORD H3050 shall not see H7200 (8799), neither shall the God H0430 of Jacob H3290 regard H0995 (8799) [it].
094:008 Understand H0995 (8798), ye brutish H1197 (8802) among the people H5971: and [ye] fools H3684, when will ye be wise H7919 (8686)?
094:009 He that planted H5193 (8802) the ear H0241, shall he not hear H8085 (8799)? he that formed H3335 (8802) the eye H5869, shall he not see H5027 (8686)?
094:010 He that chastiseth H3256 (8802) the heathen H1471, shall not he correct H3198 (8686)? he that teacheth H3925 (8764) man H0120 knowledge H1847, [shall not he know]?
094:011 The LORD H3068 knoweth H3045 (8802) the thoughts H4284 of man H0120, that they [are] vanity H1892.
094:012 Blessed H0835 [is] the man H1397 whom thou chastenest H3256 (8762), O LORD H3050, and teachest H3925 (8762) him out of thy law H8451;
094:013 That thou mayest give him rest H8252 (8687) from the days H3117 of adversity H7451, until the pit H7845 be digged H3738 (8735) for the wicked H7563.
094:014 For the LORD H3068 will not cast off H5203 (8799) his people H5971, neither will he forsake H5800 (8799) his inheritance H5159.
094:015 But judgment H4941 shall return H7725 (8799) unto righteousness H6664: and all the upright H3477 in heart H3820 shall follow H0310 it.
094:016 Who will rise up H6965 (8799) for me against the evildoers H7489 (8688)? [or] who will stand up H3320 (8691) for me against the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205?
094:017 Unless H3884 the LORD H3068 [had been] my help H5833, my soul H5315 had almost H4592 dwelt H7931 (8804) in silence H1745.
094:018 When I said H0559 (8804), My foot H7272 slippeth H4131 (8804); thy mercy H2617, O LORD H3068, held me up H5582 (8799).
094:019 In the multitude H7230 of my thoughts H8312 within H7130 me thy comforts H8575 delight H8173 (8770) my soul H5315.
094:020 Shall the throne H3678 of iniquity H1942 have fellowship H2266 (8792) with thee, which frameth H3335 (8802) mischief H5999 by a law H2706?
094:021 They gather themselves together H1413 (8799) against the soul H5315 of the righteous H6662, and condemn H7561 (8686) the innocent H5355 blood H1818.
094:022 But the LORD H3068 is my defence H4869; and my God H0430 [is] the rock H6697 of my refuge H4268.
094:023 And he shall bring H7725 (8686) upon them their own iniquity H0205, and shall cut them off H6789 (8686) in their own wickedness H7451; [yea], the LORD H3068 our God H0430 shall cut them off H6789 (8686).
095:001 ¶  O come H3212 (8798), let us sing H7442 (8762) unto the LORD H3068: let us make a joyful noise H7321 (8686) to the rock H6697 of our salvation H3468.
095:002 Let us come H6923 (8762) before his presence H6440 with thanksgiving H8426, and make a joyful noise H7321 (8686) unto him with psalms H2158.
095:003 For the LORD H3068 [is] a great H1419 God H0410, and a great H1419 King H4428 above all gods H0430.
095:004 In his hand H3027 [are] the deep places H4278 of the earth H0776: the strength H8443 of the hills H2022 [is] his also.
095:005 The sea H3220 [is] his, and he made H6213 (8804) it: and his hands H3027 formed H3335 (8804) the dry H3006 [land].
095:006 O come H0935 (8798), let us worship H7812 (8691) and bow down H3766 (8799): let us kneel H1288 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068 our maker H6213 (8802).
095:007 For he [is] our God H0430; and we [are] the people H5971 of his pasture H4830, and the sheep H6629 of his hand H3027. To day H3117 if ye will hear H8085 (8799) his voice H6963,
095:008 Harden H7185 (8686) not your heart H3824, as in the provocation H4808, [and] as [in] the day H3117 of temptation H4531 in the wilderness H4057:
095:009 When your fathers H0001 tempted H5254 (8765) me, proved H0974 (8804) me, and saw H7200 (8804) my work H6467.
095:010 Forty H0705 years H8141 long was I grieved H6962 (8799) with [this] generation H1755, and said H0559 (8799), It [is] a people H5971 that do err H8582 (8802) in their heart H3824, and they have not known H3045 (8804) my ways H1870:
095:011 Unto whom I sware H7650 (8738) in my wrath H0639 that they should not enter H0935 (8799) into my rest H4496.
096:001 ¶  O sing H7891 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 a new H2319 song H7892: sing H7891 (8798) unto the LORD H3068, all the earth H0776.
096:002 Sing H7891 (8798) unto the LORD H3068, bless H1288 (8761) his name H8034; shew forth H1319 (8761) his salvation H3444 from day H3117 to day H3117.
096:003 Declare H5608 (8761) his glory H3519 among the heathen H1471, his wonders H6381 (8737) among all people H5971.
096:004 For the LORD H3068 [is] great H1419, and greatly H3966 to be praised H1984 (8794): he [is] to be feared H3372 (8737) above all gods H0430.
096:005 For all the gods H0430 of the nations H5971 [are] idols H0457: but the LORD H3068 made H6213 (8804) the heavens H8064.
096:006 Honour H1935 and majesty H1926 [are] before H6440 him: strength H5797 and beauty H8597 [are] in his sanctuary H4720.
096:007 Give H3051 (8798) unto the LORD H3068, O ye kindreds H4940 of the people H5971, give H3051 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 glory H3519 and strength H5797.
096:008 Give H3051 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 the glory H3519 [due unto] his name H8034: bring H5375 (8798) an offering H4503, and come H0935 (8798) into his courts H2691.
096:009 O worship H7812 (8690) the LORD H3068 in the beauty H1927 of holiness H6944: fear H2342 (8798) before H6440 him, all the earth H0776.
096:010 Say H0559 (8798) among the heathen H1471 [that] the LORD H3068 reigneth H4427 (8804): the world H8398 also shall be established H3559 (8735) that it shall not be moved H4131 (8735): he shall judge H1777 (8799) the people H5971 righteously H4339.
096:011 Let the heavens H8064 rejoice H8055 (8799), and let the earth H0776 be glad H1523 (8799); let the sea H3220 roar H7481 (8799), and the fulness H4393 thereof.
096:012 Let the field H7704 be joyful H5937 (8799), and all that [is] therein: then shall all the trees H6086 of the wood H3293 rejoice H7442 (8762)
096:013 Before H6440 the LORD H3068: for he cometh H0935 (8804), for he cometh H0935 (8804) to judge H8199 (8800) the earth H0776: he shall judge H8199 (8799) the world H8398 with righteousness H6664, and the people H5971 with his truth H0530.
097:001 ¶  The LORD H3068 reigneth H4427 (8804); let the earth H0776 rejoice H1523 (8799); let the multitude H7227 of isles H0339 be glad H8055 (8799) [thereof].
097:002 Clouds H6051 and darkness H6205 [are] round about H5439 him: righteousness H6664 and judgment H4941 [are] the habitation H4349 of his throne H3678.
097:003 A fire H0784 goeth H3212 (8799) before H6440 him, and burneth up H3857 (8762) his enemies H6862 round about H5439.
097:004 His lightnings H1300 enlightened H0215 (8689) the world H8398: the earth H0776 saw H7200 (8804), and trembled H2342 (8799).
097:005 The hills H2022 melted H4549 (8738) like wax H1749 at the presence H6440 of the LORD H3068, at the presence H6440 of the Lord H0113 of the whole earth H0776.
097:006 The heavens H8064 declare H5046 (8689) his righteousness H6664, and all the people H5971 see H7200 (8804) his glory H3519.
097:007 Confounded H0954 (8799) be all they that serve H5647 (8802) graven images H6459, that boast H1984 (8693) themselves of idols H0457: worship H7812 (8690) him, all [ye] gods H0430.
097:008 Zion H6726 heard H8085 (8804), and was glad H8055 (8799); and the daughters H1323 of Judah H3063 rejoiced H1523 (8799) because of thy judgments H4941, O LORD H3068.
097:009 For thou, LORD H3068, [art] high above H5945 all the earth H0776: thou art exalted H5927 (8738) far above H3966 all gods H0430.
097:010 Ye that love H0157 (8802) the LORD H3068, hate H8130 (8798) evil H7451: he preserveth H8104 (8802) the souls H5315 of his saints H2623; he delivereth H5337 (8686) them out of the hand H3027 of the wicked H7563.
097:011 Light H0216 is sown H2232 (8803) for the righteous H6662, and gladness H8057 for the upright H3477 in heart H3820.
097:012 Rejoice H8055 (8798) in the LORD H3068, ye righteous H6662; and give thanks H3034 (8685) at the remembrance H2143 of his holiness H6944.
098:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210.» O sing H7891 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 a new H2319 song H7892; for he hath done H6213 (8804) marvellous things H6381 (8737): his right hand H3225, and his holy H6944 arm H2220, hath gotten him the victory H3467 (8689).
098:002 The LORD H3068 hath made known H3045 (8689) his salvation H3444: his righteousness H6666 hath he openly shewed H1540 (8765) in the sight H5869 of the heathen H1471.
098:003 He hath remembered H2142 (8804) his mercy H2617 and his truth H0530 toward the house H1004 of Israel H3478: all the ends H0657 of the earth H0776 have seen H7200 (8804) the salvation H3444 of our God H0430.
098:004 Make a joyful noise H7321 (8685) unto the LORD H3068, all the earth H0776: make a loud noise H6476 (8798), and rejoice H7442 (8761), and sing H2167 (8761) praise.
098:005 Sing H2167 (8761) unto the LORD H3068 with the harp H3658; with the harp H3658, and the voice H6963 of a psalm H2172.
098:006 With trumpets H2689 and sound H6963 of cornet H7782 make a joyful noise H7321 (8685) before H6440 the LORD H3068, the King H4428.
098:007 Let the sea H3220 roar H7481 (8799), and the fulness H4393 thereof; the world H8398, and they that dwell H3427 (8802) therein.
098:008 Let the floods H5104 clap H4222 (8799) [their] hands H3709: let the hills H2022 be joyful H7442 (8762) together H3162
098:009 Before H6440 the LORD H3068; for he cometh H0935 (8804) to judge H8199 (8800) the earth H0776: with righteousness H6664 shall he judge H8199 (8799) the world H8398, and the people H5971 with equity H4339.
099:001 ¶  The LORD H3068 reigneth H4427 (8804); let the people H5971 tremble H7264 (8799): he sitteth H3427 (8802) [between] the cherubims H3742; let the earth H0776 be moved H5120 (8799).
099:002 The LORD H3068 [is] great H1419 in Zion H6726; and he [is] high H7311 (8804) above all the people H5971.
099:003 Let them praise H3034 (8686) thy great H1419 and terrible H3372 (8737) name H8034; [for] it [is] holy H6918.
099:004 The king’s H4428 strength H5797 also loveth H0157 (8804) judgment H4941; thou dost establish H3559 (8790) equity H4339, thou executest H6213 (8804) judgment H4941 and righteousness H6666 in Jacob H3290.
099:005 Exalt H7311 (8786) ye the LORD H3068 our God H0430, and worship H7812 (8690) at his footstool H7272 H1916; [for] he [is] holy H6918.
099:006 Moses H4872 and Aaron H0175 among his priests H3548, and Samuel H8050 among them that call H7121 (8802) upon his name H8034; they called H7121 (8802) upon the LORD H3068, and he answered H6030 (8799) them.
099:007 He spake H1696 (8762) unto them in the cloudy H6051 pillar H5982: they kept H8104 (8804) his testimonies H5713, and the ordinance H2706 [that] he gave H5414 (8804) them.
099:008 Thou answeredst H6030 (8804) them, O LORD H3068 our God H0430: thou wast a God H0410 that forgavest H5375 (8802) them, though thou tookest vengeance H5358 (8802) of their inventions H5949.
099:009 Exalt H7311 (8786) the LORD H3068 our God H0430, and worship H7812 (8690) at his holy H6944 hill H2022; for the LORD H3068 our God H0430 [is] holy H6918.
100:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of praise H8426.» Make a joyful noise H7321 (8685) unto the LORD H3068, all ye lands H0776.
100:002 Serve H5647 (8798) the LORD H3068 with gladness H8057: come H0935 (8798) before his presence H6440 with singing H7445.
100:003 Know H3045 (8798) ye that the LORD H3068 he [is] God H0430: [it is] he [that] hath made H6213 (8804) us, and not we ourselves; [we are] his people H5971, and the sheep H6629 of his pasture H4830.
100:004 Enter H0935 (8798) into his gates H8179 with thanksgiving H8426, [and] into his courts H2691 with praise H8416: be thankful H3034 (8685) unto him, [and] bless H1288 (8761) his name H8034.
100:005 For the LORD H3068 [is] good H2896; his mercy H2617 [is] everlasting H5769; and his truth H0530 [endureth] to all H1755 generations H1755.
101:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» I will sing H7891 (8799) of mercy H2617 and judgment H4941: unto thee, O LORD H3068, will I sing H2167 (8762).
101:002 I will behave myself wisely H7919 (8686) in a perfect H8549 way H1870. O when wilt thou come H0935 (8799) unto me? I will walk H1980 (8691) within H7130 my house H1004 with a perfect H8537 heart H3824.
101:003 I will set H7896 (8799) no wicked H1100 thing H1697 before mine eyes H5869: I hate H8130 (8804) the work H6213 (8800) of them that turn aside H7750; [it] shall not cleave H1692 (8799) to me.
101:004 A froward H6141 heart H3824 shall depart H5493 (8799) from me: I will not know H3045 (8799) a wicked H7451 [person].
101:005 Whoso privily H5643 slandereth H3960 (8764) (8675) H3960 (8781) his neighbour H7453, him will I cut off H6789 (8686): him that hath an high H1362 look H5869 and a proud H7342 heart H3824 will not I suffer H3201 (8799).
101:006 Mine eyes H5869 [shall be] upon the faithful H0539 (8737) of the land H0776, that they may dwell H3427 (8800) with me: he that walketh H1980 (8802) in a perfect H8549 way H1870, he shall serve H8334 (8762) me.
101:007 He that worketh H6213 (8802) deceit H7423 shall not dwell H3427 (8799) within H7130 my house H1004: he that telleth H1696 (8802) lies H8267 shall not tarry H3559 (8735) in my sight H5869.
101:008 I will early H1242 destroy H6789 (8686) all the wicked H7563 of the land H0776; that I may cut off H3772 (8687) all wicked H0205 doers H6466 (8802) from the city H5892 of the LORD H3068.
102:001 ¶  «A Prayer H8605 of the afflicted H6041, when he is overwhelmed H5848 (8799), and poureth out H8210 (8799) his complaint H7879 before H6440 the LORD H3068.» Hear H8085 (8798) my prayer H8605, O LORD H3068, and let my cry H7775 come H0935 (8799) unto thee.
102:002 Hide H5641 (8686) not thy face H6440 from me in the day H3117 [when] I am in trouble H6862; incline H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241 unto me: in the day H3117 [when] I call H7121 (8799) answer H6030 (8798) me speedily H4118.
102:003 For my days H3117 are consumed H3615 (8804) like smoke H6227, and my bones H6106 are burned H2787 (8738) as an hearth H4168.
102:004 My heart H3820 is smitten H5221 (8717), and withered H3001 (8799) like grass H6212; so that I forget H7911 (8804) to eat H0398 (8800) my bread H3899.
102:005 By reason of the voice H6963 of my groaning H0585 my bones H6106 cleave H1692 (8804) to my skin H1320.
102:006 I am like H1819 (8804) a pelican H6893 of the wilderness H4057: I am like an owl H3563 of the desert H2723.
102:007 I watch H8245 (8804), and am as a sparrow H6833 alone H0909 (8802) upon the house top H1406.
102:008 Mine enemies H0341 (8802) reproach H2778 (8765) me all the day H3117; [and] they that are mad H1984 (8781) against me are sworn H7650 (8738) against me.
102:009 For I have eaten H0398 (8804) ashes H0665 like bread H3899, and mingled H4537 (8804) my drink H8249 with weeping H1065,
102:010 Because H6440 of thine indignation H2195 and thy wrath H7110: for thou hast lifted me up H5375 (8804), and cast me down H7993 (8686).
102:011 My days H3117 [are] like a shadow H6738 that declineth H5186 (8803); and I am withered H3001 (8799) like grass H6212.
102:012 But thou, O LORD H3068, shalt endure H3427 (8799) for ever H5769; and thy remembrance H2143 unto all H1755 generations H1755.
102:013 Thou shalt arise H6965 (8799), [and] have mercy H7355 (8762) upon Zion H6726: for the time H6256 to favour H2603 (8800) her, yea, the set time H4150, is come H0935 (8804).
102:014 For thy servants H5650 take pleasure H7521 (8804) in her stones H0068, and favour H2603 (8779) the dust H6083 thereof.
102:015 So the heathen H1471 shall fear H3372 (8799) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, and all the kings H4428 of the earth H0776 thy glory H3519.
102:016 When the LORD H3068 shall build up H1129 (8804) Zion H6726, he shall appear H7200 (8738) in his glory H3519.
102:017 He will regard H6437 (8804) the prayer H8605 of the destitute H6199, and not despise H0959 (8804) their prayer H8605.
102:018 This shall be written H3789 (8735) for the generation H1755 to come H0314: and the people H5971 which shall be created H1254 (8737) shall praise H1984 (8762) the LORD H3050.
102:019 For he hath looked down H8259 (8689) from the height H4791 of his sanctuary H6944; from heaven H8064 did the LORD H3068 behold H5027 (8689) the earth H0776;
102:020 To hear H8085 (8800) the groaning H0603 of the prisoner H0615; to loose H6605 (8763) those that are appointed H1121 to death H8546;
102:021 To declare H5608 (8763) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 in Zion H6726, and his praise H8416 in Jerusalem H3389;
102:022 When the people H5971 are gathered H6908 (8736) together H3162, and the kingdoms H4467, to serve H5647 (8800) the LORD H3068.
102:023 He weakened H6031 (8765) my strength H3581 in the way H1870; he shortened H7114 (8765) my days H3117.
102:024 I said H0559 (8799), O my God H0410, take me not away H5927 (8686) in the midst H2677 of my days H3117: thy years H8141 [are] throughout all H1755 generations H1755.
102:025 Of old H6440 hast thou laid the foundation H3245 (8804) of the earth H0776: and the heavens H8064 [are] the work H4639 of thy hands H3027.
102:026 They shall perish H0006 (8799), but thou shalt endure H5975 (8799): yea, all of them shall wax old H1086 (8799) like a garment H0899; as a vesture H3830 shalt thou change H2498 (8686) them, and they shall be changed H2498 (8799):
102:027 But thou [art] the same, and thy years H8141 shall have no end H8552 (8735).
102:028 The children H1121 of thy servants H5650 shall continue H7931 (8799), and their seed H2233 shall be established H3559 (8735) before H6440 thee.
103:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732.» Bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068, O my soul H5315: and all that is within H7130 me, [bless] his holy H6944 name H8034.
103:002 Bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068, O my soul H5315, and forget H7911 (8799) not all his benefits H1576:
103:003 Who forgiveth H5545 (8802) all thine iniquities H5771; who healeth H7495 (8802) all thy diseases H8463;
103:004 Who redeemeth H1350 (8802) thy life H2416 from destruction H7845; who crowneth H5849 (8764) thee with lovingkindness H2617 and tender mercies H7356;
103:005 Who satisfieth H7646 (8688) thy mouth H5716 with good H2896 [things; so that] thy youth H5271 is renewed H2318 (8691) like the eagle’s H5404.
103:006 The LORD H3068 executeth H6213 (8802) righteousness H6666 and judgment H4941 for all that are oppressed H6231 (8803).
103:007 He made known H3045 (8686) his ways H1870 unto Moses H4872, his acts H5949 unto the children H1121 of Israel H3478.
103:008 The LORD H3068 [is] merciful H7349 and gracious H2587, slow H0750 to anger H0639, and plenteous H7227 in mercy H2617.
103:009 He will not always H5331 chide H7378 (8799): neither will he keep H5201 (8799) [his anger] for ever H5769.
103:010 He hath not dealt H6213 (8804) with us after our sins H2399; nor rewarded H1580 (8804) us according to our iniquities H5771.
103:011 For as the heaven H8064 is high above H1361 (8800) the earth H0776, [so] great H1396 (8804) is his mercy H2617 toward them that fear H3373 him.
103:012 As far as H7368 (8800) the east H4217 is from the west H4628, [so] far hath he removed H7368 (8689) our transgressions H6588 from us.
103:013 Like as a father H0001 pitieth H7355 (8763) [his] children H1121, [so] the LORD H3068 pitieth H7355 (8765) them that fear H3373 him.
103:014 For he knoweth H3045 (8804) our frame H3336; he remembereth H2142 (8803) that we [are] dust H6083.
103:015 [As for] man H0582, his days H3117 [are] as grass H2682: as a flower H6731 of the field H7704, so he flourisheth H6692 (8686).
103:016 For the wind H7307 passeth over H5674 (8804) it, and it is gone; and the place H4725 thereof shall know H5234 (8686) it no more.
103:017 But the mercy H2617 of the LORD H3068 [is] from everlasting H5769 to H5704 everlasting H5769 upon them that fear H3373 him, and his righteousness H6666 unto children’s H1121 children H1121;
103:018 To such as keep H8104 (8802) his covenant H1285, and to those that remember H2142 (8802) his commandments H6490 to do H6213 (8800) them.
103:019 The LORD H3068 hath prepared H3559 (8689) his throne H3678 in the heavens H8064; and his kingdom H4438 ruleth H4910 (8804) over all.
103:020 Bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068, ye his angels H4397, that excel H1368 in strength H3581, that do H6213 (8802) his commandments H1697, hearkening H8085 (8800) unto the voice H6963 of his word H1697.
103:021 Bless H1288 (8761) ye the LORD H3068, all [ye] his hosts H6635; [ye] ministers H8334 (8764) of his, that do H6213 (8802) his pleasure H7522.
103:022 Bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068, all his works H4639 in all places H4725 of his dominion H4475: bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068, O my soul H5315.
104:001 ¶  Bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068, O my soul H5315. O LORD H3068 my God H0430, thou art very H3966 great H1431 (8804); thou art clothed H3847 (8804) with honour H1935 and majesty H1926.
104:002 Who coverest H5844 (8802) [thyself] with light H0216 as [with] a garment H8008: who stretchest out H5186 (8802) the heavens H8064 like a curtain H3407:
104:003 Who layeth the beams H7136 (8764) of his chambers H5944 in the waters H4325: who maketh H7760 (8802) the clouds H5645 his chariot H7398: who walketh H1980 (8764) upon the wings H3671 of the wind H7307:
104:004 Who maketh H6213 (8802) his angels H4397 spirits H7307; his ministers H8334 (8764) a flaming H3857 (8802) fire H0784:
104:005 [Who] laid H3245 (8804) the foundations H4349 of the earth H0776, [that] it should not be removed H4131 (8735) for ever H5769 H5703.
104:006 Thou coveredst H3680 (8765) it with the deep H8415 as [with] a garment H3830: the waters H4325 stood H5975 (8799) above the mountains H2022.
104:007 At H4480 thy rebuke H1606 they fled H5127 (8799); at the voice H6963 of thy thunder H7482 they hasted H2648 (8735) away.
104:008 They go up H5927 (8799) by the mountains H2022; they go down H3381 (8799) by the valleys H1237 unto the place H4725 which H2088 thou hast founded H3245 (8804) for them.
104:009 Thou hast set H7760 (8804) a bound H1366 that they may not pass over H5674 (8799); that they turn not again H7725 (8799) to cover H3680 (8763) the earth H0776.
104:010 He sendeth H7971 (8764) the springs H4599 into the valleys H5158, [which] run H1980 (8762) among the hills H2022.
104:011 They give drink H8248 (8686) to every beast H2416 of the field H7704: the wild asses H6501 quench H7665 (8799) their thirst H6772.
104:012 By them shall the fowls H5775 of the heaven H8064 have their habitation H7931 (8799), [which] sing H5414 (8799) H6963 among H0996 the branches H6073.
104:013 He watereth H8248 (8688) the hills H2022 from his chambers H5944: the earth H0776 is satisfied H7646 (8799) with the fruit H6529 of thy works H4639.
104:014 He causeth the grass H2682 to grow H6779 (8688) for the cattle H0929, and herb H6212 for the service H5656 of man H0120: that he may bring forth H3318 (8687) food H3899 out of the earth H0776;
104:015 And wine H3196 [that] maketh glad H8055 (8762) the heart H3824 of man H0582, [and] oil H8081 to make [his] face H6440 to shine H6670 (8687), and bread H3899 [which] strengtheneth H5582 (8799) man’s H0582 heart H3824.
104:016 The trees H6086 of the LORD H3068 are full H7646 (8799) [of sap]; the cedars H0730 of Lebanon H3844, which he hath planted H5193 (8804);
104:017 Where the birds H6833 make their nests H7077 (8762): [as for] the stork H2624, the fir trees H1265 [are] her house H1004.
104:018 The high H1364 hills H2022 [are] a refuge H4268 for the wild goats H3277; [and] the rocks H5553 for the conies H8227.
104:019 He appointed H6213 (8804) the moon H3394 for seasons H4150: the sun H8121 knoweth H3045 (8804) his going down H3996.
104:020 Thou makest H7896 (8799) darkness H2822, and it is night H3915: wherein all the beasts H2416 of the forest H3293 do creep H7430 (8799) [forth].
104:021 The young lions H3715 roar H7580 (8802) after their prey H2964, and seek H1245 (8763) their meat H0400 from God H0410.
104:022 The sun H8121 ariseth H2224 (8799), they gather themselves together H0622 (8735), and lay them down H7257 (8799) in their dens H4585.
104:023 Man H0120 goeth forth H3318 (8799) unto his work H6467 and to his labour H5656 until the evening H6153.
104:024 O LORD H3068, how manifold H7231 (8804) are thy works H4639! in wisdom H2451 hast thou made H6213 (8804) them all: the earth H0776 is full H4390 (8804) of thy riches H7075.
104:025 [So is] this great H1419 and wide H7342 H3027 sea H3220, wherein [are] things creeping H7431 innumerable H4557, both small H6996 and great H1419 beasts H2416.
104:026 There go H1980 (8762) the ships H0591: [there is] that leviathan H3882, [whom] thou hast made H3335 (8804) to play H7832 (8763) therein.
104:027 These wait H7663 (8762) all upon thee; that thou mayest give H5414 (8800) [them] their meat H0400 in due season H6256.
104:028 [That] thou givest H5414 (8799) them they gather H3950 (8799): thou openest H6605 (8799) thine hand H3027, they are filled H7646 (8799) with good H2896.
104:029 Thou hidest H5641 (8686) thy face H6440, they are troubled H0926 (8735): thou takest away H0622 (8799) their breath H7307, they die H1478 (8799), and return H7725 (8799) to their dust H6083.
104:030 Thou sendest H7971 (8762) forth thy spirit H7307, they are created H1254 (8735): and thou renewest H2318 (8762) the face H6440 of the earth H0127.
104:031 The glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 shall endure for ever H5769: the LORD H3068 shall rejoice H8055 (8799) in his works H4639.
104:032 He looketh H5027 (8688) on the earth H0776, and it trembleth H7460 (8799): he toucheth H5060 (8799) the hills H2022, and they smoke H6225 (8799).
104:033 I will sing H7891 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 as long as I live H2416: I will sing H2167 (8762) praise to my God H0430 while I have my being H5750.
104:034 My meditation H7879 of him shall be sweet H6149 (8799): I will be glad H8055 (8799) in the LORD H3068.
104:035 Let the sinners H2400 be consumed H8552 (8735) out of the earth H0776, and let the wicked H7563 be no more. Bless H1288 (8761) thou the LORD H3068, O my soul H5315. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.
105:001 ¶  O give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the LORD H3068; call H7121 (8798) upon his name H8034: make known H3045 (8685) his deeds H5949 among the people H5971.
105:002 Sing H7891 (8798) unto him, sing psalms H2167 (8761) unto him: talk H7878 (8798) ye of all his wondrous works H6381 (8737).
105:003 Glory H1984 (8690) ye in his holy H6944 name H8034: let the heart H3820 of them rejoice H8055 (8799) that seek H1245 (8764) the LORD H3068.
105:004 Seek H1875 (8798) the LORD H3068, and his strength H5797: seek H1245 (8761) his face H6440 evermore H8548.
105:005 Remember H2142 (8798) his marvellous works H6381 (8737) that he hath done H6213 (8804); his wonders H4159, and the judgments H4941 of his mouth H6310;
105:006 O ye seed H2233 of Abraham H0085 his servant H5650, ye children H1121 of Jacob H3290 his chosen H0972.
105:007 He [is] the LORD H3068 our God H0430: his judgments H4941 [are] in all the earth H0776.
105:008 He hath remembered H2142 (8804) his covenant H1285 for ever H5769, the word H1697 [which] he commanded H6680 (8765) to a thousand H0505 generations H1755.
105:009 Which [covenant] he made H3772 (8804) with Abraham H0085, and his oath H7621 unto Isaac H3446;
105:010 And confirmed H5975 (8686) the same unto Jacob H3290 for a law H2706, [and] to Israel H3478 [for] an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285:
105:011 Saying H0559 (8800), Unto thee will I give H5414 (8799) the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, the lot H2256 of your inheritance H5159:
105:012 When they were [but] a few men H4962 in number H4557; yea, very few H4592, and strangers H1481 (8802) in it.
105:013 When they went H1980 (8691) from one nation H1471 to another, from [one] kingdom H4467 to another H0312 people H5971;
105:014 He suffered H3240 (8689) no man H0120 to do them wrong H6231 (8800): yea, he reproved H3198 (8686) kings H4428 for their sakes;
105:015 [Saying], Touch H5060 (8799) not mine anointed H4899, and do my prophets H5030 no harm H7489 (8686).
105:016 Moreover he called H7121 (8799) for a famine H7458 upon the land H0776: he brake H7665 (8804) the whole staff H4294 of bread H3899.
105:017 He sent H7971 (8804) a man H0376 before H6440 them, [even] Joseph H3130, [who] was sold H4376 (8738) for a servant H5650:
105:018 Whose feet H7272 they hurt H6031 (8765) with fetters H3525: he H5315 was laid H0935 (8804) in iron H1270:
105:019 Until the time H6256 that his word H1697 came H0935 (8800): the word H0565 of the LORD H3068 tried H6884 (8804) him.
105:020 The king H4428 sent H7971 (8804) and loosed H5425 (8686) him; [even] the ruler H4910 (8802) of the people H5971, and let him go free H6605 (8762).
105:021 He made H7760 (8804) him lord H0113 of his house H1004, and ruler H4910 (8802) of all his substance H7075:
105:022 To bind H0631 (8800) his princes H8269 at his pleasure H5315; and teach his senators H2205 wisdom H2449 (8762).
105:023 Israel H3478 also came H0935 (8799) into Egypt H4714; and Jacob H3290 sojourned H1481 (8804) in the land H0776 of Ham H2526.
105:024 And he increased H6509 (8686) his people H5971 greatly H3966; and made them stronger H6105 (8686) than their enemies H6862.
105:025 He turned H2015 (8804) their heart H3820 to hate H8130 (8800) his people H5971, to deal subtilly H5230 (8692) with his servants H5650.
105:026 He sent H7971 (8804) Moses H4872 his servant H5650; [and] Aaron H0175 whom he had chosen H0977 (8804).
105:027 They shewed H7760 (8804) his signs H0226 H1697 among them, and wonders H4159 in the land H0776 of Ham H2526.
105:028 He sent H7971 (8804) darkness H2822, and made it dark H2821 (8686); and they rebelled H4784 (8804) not against his word H1697.
105:029 He turned H2015 (8804) their waters H4325 into blood H1818, and slew H4191 (8686) their fish H1710.
105:030 Their land H0776 brought forth H8317 frogs H6854 in abundance H8317 (8804), in the chambers H2315 of their kings H4428.
105:031 He spake H0559 (8804), and there came H0935 (8799) divers sorts of flies H6157, [and] lice H3654 in all their coasts H1366.
105:032 He gave H5414 (8804) them hail H1259 for rain H1653, [and] flaming H3852 fire H0784 in their land H0776.
105:033 He smote H5221 (8686) their vines H1612 also and their fig trees H8384; and brake H7665 (8762) the trees H6086 of their coasts H1366.
105:034 He spake H0559 (8804), and the locusts H0697 came H0935 (8799), and caterpillers H3218, and that without number H4557,
105:035 And did eat up H0398 (8799) all the herbs H6212 in their land H0776, and devoured H0398 (8799) the fruit H6529 of their ground H0127.
105:036 He smote H5221 (8686) also all the firstborn H1060 in their land H0776, the chief H7225 of all their strength H0202.
105:037 He brought them forth H3318 (8686) also with silver H3701 and gold H2091: and [there was] not one feeble H3782 (8802) [person] among their tribes H7626.
105:038 Egypt H4714 was glad H8055 (8804) when they departed H3318 (8800): for the fear H6343 of them fell H5307 (8804) upon them.
105:039 He spread H6566 (8804) a cloud H6051 for a covering H4539; and fire H0784 to give light H0215 (8687) in the night H3915.
105:040 [The people] asked H7592 (8804), and he brought H0935 (8686) quails H7958, and satisfied H7646 (8686) them with the bread H3899 of heaven H8064.
105:041 He opened H6605 (8804) the rock H6697, and the waters H4325 gushed out H2100 (8799); they ran H1980 (8804) in the dry places H6723 [like] a river H5104.
105:042 For he remembered H2142 (8804) his holy H6944 promise H1697, [and] Abraham H0085 his servant H5650.
105:043 And he brought forth H3318 (8686) his people H5971 with joy H8342, [and] his chosen H0972 with gladness H7440:
105:044 And gave H5414 (8799) them the lands H0776 of the heathen H1471: and they inherited H3423 (8799) the labour H5999 of the people H3816;
105:045 That they might observe H8104 (8799) his statutes H2706, and keep H5341 (8799) his laws H8451. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.
106:001 ¶  Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050. O give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the LORD H3068; for [he is] good H2896: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
106:002 Who can utter H4448 (8762) the mighty acts H1369 of the LORD H3068? [who] can shew forth H8085 (8686) all his praise H8416?
106:003 Blessed H0835 [are] they that keep H8104 (8802) judgment H4941, [and] he that doeth H6213 (8802) righteousness H6666 at all times H6256.
106:004 Remember H2142 (8798) me, O LORD H3068, with the favour H7522 [that thou bearest unto] thy people H5971: O visit H6485 (8798) me with thy salvation H3444;
106:005 That I may see H7200 (8800) the good H2896 of thy chosen H0972, that I may rejoice H8055 (8800) in the gladness H8057 of thy nation H1471, that I may glory H1984 (8692) with thine inheritance H5159.
106:006 We have sinned H2398 (8804) with our fathers H0001, we have committed iniquity H5753 (8689), we have done wickedly H7561 (8689).
106:007 Our fathers H0001 understood H7919 (8689) not thy wonders H6381 (8737) in Egypt H4714; they remembered H2142 (8804) not the multitude H7230 of thy mercies H2617; but provoked H4784 (8686) [him] at the sea H3220, [even] at the Red H5488 sea H3220.
106:008 Nevertheless he saved H3467 (8686) them for his name’s H8034 sake, that he might make his mighty power H1369 to be known H3045 (8687).
106:009 He rebuked H1605 (8799) the Red H5488 sea H3220 also, and it was dried up H2717 (8799): so he led H3212 (8686) them through the depths H8415, as through the wilderness H4057.
106:010 And he saved H3467 (8686) them from the hand H3027 of him that hated H8130 (8802) [them], and redeemed H1350 (8799) them from the hand H3027 of the enemy H0341 (8802).
106:011 And the waters H4325 covered H3680 (8762) their enemies H6862: there was not one H0259 of them left H3498 (8738).
106:012 Then believed H0539 (8686) they his words H1697; they sang H7891 (8799) his praise H8416.
106:013 They soon H4116 (8765) forgat H7911 (8804) his works H4639; they waited H2442 (8765) not for his counsel H6098:
106:014 But lusted H0183 (8691) exceedingly H8378 in the wilderness H4057, and tempted H5254 (8762) God H0410 in the desert H3452.
106:015 And he gave H5414 (8799) them their request H7596; but sent H7971 (8762) leanness H7332 into their soul H5315.
106:016 They envied H7065 (8762) Moses H4872 also in the camp H4264, [and] Aaron H0175 the saint H6918 of the LORD H3068.
106:017 The earth H0776 opened H6605 (8799) and swallowed up H1104 (8799) Dathan H1885, and covered H3680 (8762) the company H5712 of Abiram H0048.
106:018 And a fire H0784 was kindled H1197 (8799) in their company H5712; the flame H3852 burned up H3857 (8762) the wicked H7563.
106:019 They made H6213 (8799) a calf H5695 in Horeb H2722, and worshipped H7812 (8691) the molten image H4541.
106:020 Thus they changed H4171 (8686) their glory H3519 into the similitude H8403 of an ox H7794 that eateth H0398 (8802) grass H6212.
106:021 They forgat H7911 (8804) God H0410 their saviour H3467 (8688), which had done H6213 (8802) great things H1419 in Egypt H4714;
106:022 Wondrous works H6381 (8737) in the land H0776 of Ham H2526, [and] terrible things H3372 (8737) by the Red H5488 sea H3220.
106:023 Therefore he said H0559 (8799) that he would destroy H8045 (8687) them, had not H3884 Moses H4872 his chosen H0972 stood H5975 (8804) before H6440 him in the breach H6556, to turn away H7725 (8687) his wrath H2534, lest he should destroy H7843 (8687) [them].
106:024 Yea, they despised H3988 (8799) the pleasant H2532 land H0776, they believed H0539 (8689) not his word H1697:
106:025 But murmured H7279 (8735) in their tents H0168, [and] hearkened H8085 (8804) not unto the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068.
106:026 Therefore he lifted up H5375 (8799) his hand H3027 against them, to overthrow H5307 (8687) them in the wilderness H4057:
106:027 To overthrow H5307 (8687) their seed H2233 also among the nations H1471, and to scatter H2219 (8763) them in the lands H0776.
106:028 They joined H6775 (8735) themselves also unto Baalpeor H1187, and ate H0398 (8799) the sacrifices H2077 of the dead H4191 (8801).
106:029 Thus they provoked [him] to anger H3707 (8686) with their inventions H4611: and the plague H4046 brake in H6555 (8799) upon them.
106:030 Then stood up H5975 (8799) Phinehas H6372, and executed judgment H6419 (8762): and [so] the plague H4046 was stayed H6113 (8735).
106:031 And that was counted H2803 (8735) unto him for righteousness H6666 unto all H1755 generations H1755 for H5704 evermore H5769.
106:032 They angered H7107 (8686) [him] also at the waters H4325 of strife H4808 (8677) H4809, so that it went ill H3415 (8799) with Moses H4872 for their sakes:
106:033 Because they provoked H4784 (8689) his spirit H7307, so that he spake unadvisedly H0981 (8762) with his lips H8193.
106:034 They did not destroy H8045 (8689) the nations H5971, concerning whom the LORD H3068 commanded H0559 (8804) them:
106:035 But were mingled H6148 (8691) among the heathen H1471, and learned H3925 (8799) their works H4639.
106:036 And they served H5647 (8799) their idols H6091: which were a snare H4170 unto them.
106:037 Yea, they sacrificed H2076 (8799) their sons H1121 and their daughters H1323 unto devils H7700,
106:038 And shed H8210 (8799) innocent H5355 blood H1818, [even] the blood H1818 of their sons H1121 and of their daughters H1323, whom they sacrificed H2076 (8765) unto the idols H6091 of Canaan H3667: and the land H0776 was polluted H2610 (8799) with blood H1818.
106:039 Thus were they defiled H2930 (8799) with their own works H4639, and went a whoring H2181 (8799) with their own inventions H4611.
106:040 Therefore was the wrath H0639 of the LORD H3068 kindled H2734 (8799) against his people H5971, insomuch that he abhorred H8581 (8762) his own inheritance H5159.
106:041 And he gave H5414 (8799) them into the hand H3027 of the heathen H1471; and they that hated H8130 (8802) them ruled H4910 (8799) over them.
106:042 Their enemies H0341 (8802) also oppressed H3905 (8799) them, and they were brought into subjection H3665 (8735) under their hand H3027.
106:043 Many H7227 times H6471 did he deliver H5337 (8686) them; but they provoked H4784 (8686) [him] with their counsel H6098, and were brought low H4355 (8799) for their iniquity H5771.
106:044 Nevertheless he regarded H7200 (8799) their affliction H6862, when he heard H8085 (8800) their cry H7440:
106:045 And he remembered H2142 (8799) for them his covenant H1285, and repented H5162 (8735) according to the multitude H7230 of his mercies H2617.
106:046 He made H5414 (8799) them also to be pitied H7356 of H6440 all those that carried them captives H7617 (8802).
106:047 Save H3467 (8685) us, O LORD H3068 our God H0430, and gather H6908 (8761) us from among the heathen H1471, to give thanks H3034 (8687) unto thy holy H6944 name H8034, [and] to triumph H7623 (8692) in thy praise H8416.
106:048 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 from everlasting H5769 to everlasting H5769: and let all the people H5971 say H0559 (8804), Amen H0543. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.
107:001 ¶  O give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the LORD H3068, for [he is] good H2896: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
107:002 Let the redeemed H1350 (8803) of the LORD H3068 say H0559 (8799) [so], whom he hath redeemed H1350 (8804) from the hand H3027 of the enemy H6862;
107:003 And gathered H6908 (8765) them out of the lands H0776, from the east H4217, and from the west H4628, from the north H6828, and from the south H3220.
107:004 They wandered H8582 (8804) in the wilderness H4057 in a solitary H3452 way H1870; they found H4672 (8804) no city H5892 to dwell H4186 in.
107:005 Hungry H7457 and thirsty H6771, their soul H5315 fainted H5848 (8691) in them.
107:006 Then they cried H6817 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 in their trouble H6862, [and] he delivered H5337 (8686) them out of their distresses H4691.
107:007 And he led them forth H1869 (8686) by the right H3477 way H1870, that they might go H3212 (8800) to a city H5892 of habitation H4186.
107:008 Oh that [men] would praise H3034 (8686) the LORD H3068 [for] his goodness H2617, and [for] his wonderful works H6381 (8737) to the children H1121 of men H0120!
107:009 For he satisfieth H7646 (8689) the longing H8264 (8802) soul H5315, and filleth H4390 (8765) the hungry H7457 soul H5315 with goodness H2896.
107:010 Such as sit H3427 (8802) in darkness H2822 and in the shadow of death H6757, [being] bound H0615 in affliction H6040 and iron H1270;
107:011 Because they rebelled H4784 (8689) against the words H0561 of God H0410, and contemned H5006 (8804) the counsel H6098 of the most High H5945:
107:012 Therefore he brought down H3665 (8686) their heart H3820 with labour H5999; they fell down H3782 (8804), and [there was] none to help H5826 (8802).
107:013 Then they cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 in their trouble H6862, [and] he saved H3467 (8686) them out of their distresses H4691.
107:014 He brought them out H3318 (8686) of darkness H2822 and the shadow of death H6757, and brake H5423 their bands H4147 in sunder H5423 (8762).
107:015 Oh that [men] would praise H3034 (8686) the LORD H3068 [for] his goodness H2617, and [for] his wonderful works H6381 (8737) to the children H1121 of men H0120!
107:016 For he hath broken H7665 (8765) the gates H1817 of brass H5178, and cut H1438 the bars H1280 of iron H1270 in sunder H1438 (8765).
107:017 Fools H0191 because H1870 of their transgression H6588, and because of their iniquities H5771, are afflicted H6031 (8691).
107:018 Their soul H5315 abhorreth H8581 (8762) all manner of meat H0400; and they draw near H5060 (8686) unto the gates H8179 of death H4194.
107:019 Then they cry H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 in their trouble H6862, [and] he saveth H3467 (8686) them out of their distresses H4691.
107:020 He sent H7971 (8799) his word H1697, and healed H7495 (8799) them, and delivered H4422 (8762) [them] from their destructions H7825.
107:021 Oh that [men] would praise H3034 (8686) the LORD H3068 [for] his goodness H2617, and [for] his wonderful works H6381 (8737) to the children H1121 of men H0120!
107:022 And let them sacrifice H2076 (8799) the sacrifices H2077 of thanksgiving H8426, and declare H5608 (8762) his works H4639 with rejoicing H7440.
107:023 They that go down H3381 (8802) to the sea H3220 in ships H0591, that do H6213 (8802) business H4399 in great H7227 waters H4325;
107:024 These see H7200 (8804) the works H4639 of the LORD H3068, and his wonders H6381 (8737) in the deep H4688.
107:025 For he commandeth H0559 (8799), and raiseth H5975 (8686) the stormy H5591 wind H7307, which lifteth up H7311 (8787) the waves H1530 thereof.
107:026 They mount up H5927 (8799) to the heaven H8064, they go down H3381 (8799) again to the depths H8415: their soul H5315 is melted H4127 (8709) because of trouble H7451.
107:027 They reel to and fro H2287 (8799), and stagger H5128 (8799) like a drunken man H7910, and are at their wits H2451 ’ end H1104 (8691).
107:028 Then they cry H6817 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 in their trouble H6862, and he bringeth them out H3318 (8686) of their distresses H4691.
107:029 He maketh H6965 (8686) the storm H5591 a calm H1827, so that the waves H1530 thereof are still H2814 (8799).
107:030 Then are they glad H8055 (8799) because they be quiet H8367 (8799); so he bringeth H5148 (8686) them unto their desired H2656 haven H4231.
107:031 Oh that [men] would praise H3034 (8686) the LORD H3068 [for] his goodness H2617, and [for] his wonderful works H6381 (8737) to the children H1121 of men H0120!
107:032 Let them exalt H7311 (8787) him also in the congregation H6951 of the people H5971, and praise H1984 (8762) him in the assembly H4186 of the elders H2205.
107:033 He turneth H7760 (8799) rivers H5104 into a wilderness H4057, and the watersprings H4325 H4161 into dry ground H6774;
107:034 A fruitful H6529 land H0776 into barrenness H4420, for the wickedness H7451 of them that dwell H3427 (8802) therein.
107:035 He turneth H7760 (8799) the wilderness H4057 into a standing H0098 water H4325, and dry H6723 ground H0776 into watersprings H4325 H4161.
107:036 And there he maketh the hungry H7457 to dwell H3427 (8686), that they may prepare H3559 (8787) a city H5892 for habitation H4186;
107:037 And sow H2232 (8799) the fields H7704, and plant H5193 (8799) vineyards H3754, which may yield H6213 (8799) fruits H6529 of increase H8393.
107:038 He blesseth H1288 (8762) them also, so that they are multiplied H7235 (8799) greatly H3966; and suffereth H4591 not their cattle H0929 to decrease H4591 (8686).
107:039 Again, they are minished H4591 (8799) and brought low H7817 (8799) through oppression H6115, affliction H7451, and sorrow H3015.
107:040 He poureth H8210 (8802) contempt H0937 upon princes H5081, and causeth them to wander H8582 (8686) in the wilderness H8414, [where there is] no way H1870.
107:041 Yet setteth he the poor H0034 on high H7682 (8762) from affliction H6040, and maketh H7760 (8799) [him] families H4940 like a flock H6629.
107:042 The righteous H3477 shall see H7200 (8799) [it], and rejoice H8055 (8799): and all iniquity H5766 shall stop H7092 (8804) her mouth H6310.
107:043 Whoso [is] wise H2450, and will observe H8104 (8799) these [things], even they shall understand H0995 (8709) the lovingkindness H2617 of the LORD H3068.
108:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 [or] Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» O God H0430, my heart H3820 is fixed H3559 (8737); I will sing H7891 (8799) and give praise H2167 (8762), even with my glory H3519.
108:002 Awake H5782 (8798), psaltery H5035 and harp H3658: I [myself] will awake H5782 (8686) early H7837.
108:003 I will praise H3034 (8686) thee, O LORD H3068, among the people H5971: and I will sing praises H2167 (8762) unto thee among the nations H3816.
108:004 For thy mercy H2617 [is] great H1419 above the heavens H8064: and thy truth H0571 [reacheth] unto the clouds H7834.
108:005 Be thou exalted H7311 (8798), O God H0430, above the heavens H8064: and thy glory H3519 above all the earth H0776;
108:006 That thy beloved H3039 may be delivered H2502 (8735): save H3467 (8685) [with] thy right hand H3225, and answer H6030 (8798) me.
108:007 God H0430 hath spoken H1696 (8765) in his holiness H6944; I will rejoice H5937 (8799), I will divide H2505 (8762) Shechem H7927, and mete out H4058 (8762) the valley H6010 of Succoth H5523.
108:008 Gilead H1568 [is] mine; Manasseh H4519 [is] mine; Ephraim H0669 also [is] the strength H4581 of mine head H7218; Judah H3063 [is] my lawgiver H2710 (8781);
108:009 Moab H4124 [is] my washpot H7366 H5518; over Edom H0123 will I cast out H7993 (8686) my shoe H5275; over Philistia H6429 will I triumph H7321 (8709).
108:010 Who will bring H2986 (8686) me into the strong H4013 city H5892? who will lead H5148 (8804) me into Edom H0123?
108:011 [Wilt] not [thou], O God H0430, [who] hast cast us off H2186 (8804)? and wilt not thou, O God H0430, go forth H3318 (8799) with our hosts H6635?
108:012 Give H3051 (8798) us help H5833 from trouble H6862: for vain H7723 [is] the help H8668 of man H0120.
108:013 Through God H0430 we shall do H6213 (8799) valiantly H2428: for he [it is that] shall tread down H0947 (8799) our enemies H6862.
109:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Hold not thy peace H2790 (8799), O God H0430 of my praise H8416;
109:002 For the mouth H6310 of the wicked H7563 and the mouth H6310 of the deceitful H4820 are opened H6605 (8804) against me: they have spoken H1696 (8765) against me with a lying H8267 tongue H3956.
109:003 They compassed H5437 (8804) me about also with words H1697 of hatred H8135; and fought H3898 (8735) against me without a cause H2600.
109:004 For my love H0160 they are my adversaries H7853 (8799): but I [give myself unto] prayer H8605.
109:005 And they have rewarded H7760 (8799) me evil H7451 for good H2896, and hatred H8135 for my love H0160.
109:006 Set H6485 (8685) thou a wicked man H7563 over him: and let Satan H7854 stand H5975 (8799) at his right hand H3225.
109:007 When he shall be judged H8199 (8736), let him be H3318 (8799) condemned H7563: and let his prayer H8605 become sin H2401.
109:008 Let his days H3117 be few H4592; [and] let another H0312 take H3947 (8799) his office H6486.
109:009 Let his children H1121 be fatherless H3490, and his wife H0802 a widow H0490.
109:010 Let his children H1121 be continually H5128 (8800) vagabonds H5128 (8799), and beg H7592 (8765): let them seek H1875 (8804) [their bread] also out of their desolate places H2723.
109:011 Let the extortioner H5383 (8802) catch H5367 (8762) all that he hath; and let the strangers H2114 (8801) spoil H0962 (8799) his labour H3018.
109:012 Let there be none to extend H4900 (8802) mercy H2617 unto him: neither let there be any to favour H2603 (8802) his fatherless children H3490.
109:013 Let his posterity H0319 be cut off H3772 (8687); [and] in the generation H1755 following H0312 let their name H8034 be blotted out H4229 (8735).
109:014 Let the iniquity H5771 of his fathers H0001 be remembered H2142 (8735) with the LORD H3068; and let not the sin H2403 of his mother H0517 be blotted out H4229 (8735).
109:015 Let them be before the LORD H3068 continually H8548, that he may cut off H3772 (8686) the memory H2143 of them from the earth H0776.
109:016 Because that he remembered H2142 (8804) not to shew H6213 (8800) mercy H2617, but persecuted H7291 (8799) the poor H6041 and needy H0034 man H0376, that he might even slay H4191 (8788) the broken H3512 (8737) in heart H3824.
109:017 As he loved H0157 (8799) cursing H7045, so let it come H0935 (8799) unto him: as he delighted H2654 (8804) not in blessing H1293, so let it be far H7368 (8799) from him.
109:018 As he clothed H3847 (8799) himself with cursing H7045 like as with his garment H4055, so let it come H0935 (8799) into his bowels H7130 like water H4325, and like oil H8081 into his bones H6106.
109:019 Let it be unto him as the garment H0899 [which] covereth H5844 (8799) him, and for a girdle H4206 wherewith he is girded H2296 (8799) continually H8548.
109:020 [Let] this [be] the reward H6468 of mine adversaries H7853 (8802) from the LORD H3068, and of them that speak H1696 (8802) evil H7451 against my soul H5315.
109:021 But do H6213 (8798) thou for me, O GOD H3069 the Lord H0136, for thy name’s H8034 sake: because thy mercy H2617 [is] good H2896, deliver H5337 (8685) thou me.
109:022 For I [am] poor H6041 and needy H0034, and my heart H3820 is wounded H2490 (8804) within H7130 me.
109:023 I am gone H1980 (8738) like the shadow H6738 when it declineth H5186 (8800): I am tossed up and down H5287 (8738) as the locust H0697.
109:024 My knees H1290 are weak H3782 (8804) through fasting H6685; and my flesh H1320 faileth H3584 (8804) of fatness H8081.
109:025 I became also a reproach H2781 unto them: [when] they looked H7200 (8799) upon me they shaked H5128 (8686) their heads H7218.
109:026 Help H5826 (8798) me, O LORD H3068 my God H0430: O save H3467 (8685) me according to thy mercy H2617:
109:027 That they may know H3045 (8799) that this [is] thy hand H3027; [that] thou, LORD H3068, hast done H6213 (8804) it.
109:028 Let them curse H7043 (8762), but bless H1288 (8762) thou: when they arise H6965 (8804), let them be ashamed H0954 (8799); but let thy servant H5650 rejoice H8055 (8799).
109:029 Let mine adversaries H7853 (8802) be clothed H3847 (8799) with shame H3639, and let them cover H5844 (8799) themselves with their own confusion H1322, as with a mantle H4598.
109:030 I will greatly H3966 praise H3034 (8686) the LORD H3068 with my mouth H6310; yea, I will praise H1984 (8762) him among H8432 the multitude H7227.
109:031 For he shall stand H5975 (8799) at the right hand H3225 of the poor H0034, to save H3467 (8687) [him] from those that condemn H8199 (8802) his soul H5315.
110:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» The LORD H3068 said H5002 (8803) unto my Lord H0113, Sit H3427 (8798) thou at my right hand H3225, until I make H7896 (8799) thine enemies H0341 (8802) thy footstool H1916 H7272.
110:002 The LORD H3068 shall send H7971 (8799) the rod H4294 of thy strength H5797 out of Zion H6726: rule H7287 (8798) thou in the midst H7130 of thine enemies H0341 (8802).
110:003 Thy people H5971 [shall be] willing H5071 in the day H3117 of thy power H2428, in the beauties H1926 of holiness H6944 from the womb H7358 of the morning H4891: thou hast the dew H2919 of thy youth H3208.
110:004 The LORD H3068 hath sworn H7650 (8738), and will not repent H5162 (8735), Thou [art] a priest H3548 for ever H5769 after the order H1700 of Melchizedek H4442.
110:005 The Lord H0136 at thy right hand H3225 shall strike H4272 (8804) through kings H4428 in the day H3117 of his wrath H0639.
110:006 He shall judge H1777 (8799) among the heathen H1471, he shall fill H4390 (8804) [the places] with the dead bodies H1472; he shall wound H4272 (8804) the heads H7218 over many H7227 countries H0776.
110:007 He shall drink H8354 (8799) of the brook H5158 in the way H1870: therefore shall he lift up H7311 (8686) the head H7218.
111:001 ¶  Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050. I will praise H3034 (8686) the LORD H3068 with [my] whole heart H3824, in the assembly H5475 of the upright H3477, and [in] the congregation H5712.
111:002 The works H4639 of the LORD H3068 [are] great H1419, sought out H1875 (8803) of all them that have pleasure H2656 therein.
111:003 His work H6467 [is] honourable H1935 and glorious H1926: and his righteousness H6666 endureth H5975 (8802) for ever H5703.
111:004 He hath made H6213 (8804) his wonderful works H6381 (8737) to be remembered H2143: the LORD H3068 [is] gracious H2587 and full of compassion H7349.
111:005 He hath given H5414 (8804) meat H2964 unto them that fear H3373 him: he will ever H5769 be mindful H2142 (8799) of his covenant H1285.
111:006 He hath shewed H5046 (8689) his people H5971 the power H3581 of his works H4639, that he may give H5414 (8800) them the heritage H5159 of the heathen H1471.
111:007 The works H4639 of his hands H3027 [are] verity H0571 and judgment H4941; all his commandments H6490 [are] sure H0539 (8737).
111:008 They stand fast H5564 (8803) for ever H5703 and ever H5769, [and are] done H6213 (8803) in truth H0571 and uprightness H3477.
111:009 He sent H7971 (8804) redemption H6304 unto his people H5971: he hath commanded H6680 (8765) his covenant H1285 for ever H5769: holy H6918 and reverend H3372 (8737) [is] his name H8034.
111:010 The fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [is] the beginning H7225 of wisdom H2451: a good H2896 understanding H7922 have all they that do H6213 (8802) [his commandments]: his praise H8416 endureth H5975 (8802) for ever H5703.
112:001 ¶  Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050. Blessed H0835 [is] the man H0376 [that] feareth H3372 (8804) the LORD H3068, [that] delighteth H2654 (8804) greatly H3966 in his commandments H4687.
112:002 His seed H2233 shall be mighty H1368 upon earth H0776: the generation H1755 of the upright H3477 shall be blessed H1288 (8792).
112:003 Wealth H1952 and riches H6239 [shall be] in his house H1004: and his righteousness H6666 endureth H5975 (8802) for ever H5703.
112:004 Unto the upright H3477 there ariseth H2224 (8804) light H0216 in the darkness H2822: [he is] gracious H2587, and full of compassion H7349, and righteous H6662.
112:005 A good H2896 man H0376 sheweth favour H2603 (8802), and lendeth H3867 (8688): he will guide H3557 (8770) his affairs H1697 with discretion H4941.
112:006 Surely he shall not be moved H4131 (8735) for ever H5769: the righteous H6662 shall be in everlasting H5769 remembrance H2143.
112:007 He shall not be afraid H3372 (8799) of evil H7451 tidings H8052: his heart H3820 is fixed H3559 (8737), trusting H0982 (8803) in the LORD H3068.
112:008 His heart H3820 [is] established H5564 (8803), he shall not be afraid H3372 (8799), until he see H7200 (8799) [his desire] upon his enemies H6862.
112:009 He hath dispersed H6340 (8765), he hath given H5414 (8804) to the poor H0034; his righteousness H6666 endureth H5975 (8802) for ever H5703; his horn H7161 shall be exalted H7311 (8799) with honour H3519.
112:010 The wicked H7563 shall see H7200 (8799) [it], and be grieved H3707 (8804); he shall gnash H2786 (8799) with his teeth H8127, and melt away H4549 (8738): the desire H8378 of the wicked H7563 shall perish H0006 (8799).
113:001 ¶  Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050. Praise H1984 (8761), O ye servants H5650 of the LORD H3068, praise H1984 (8761) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
113:002 Blessed H1288 (8794) be the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 from this time forth H6258 and for H5704 evermore H5769.
113:003 From the rising H4217 of the sun H8121 unto the going down H3996 of the same the LORD’S H3068 name H8034 [is] to be praised H1984 (8794).
113:004 The LORD H3068 [is] high H7311 (8802) above all nations H1471, [and] his glory H3519 above the heavens H8064.
113:005 Who [is] like unto the LORD H3068 our God H0430, who dwelleth H3427 (8800) on high H1361 (8688),
113:006 Who humbleth H8213 (8688) [himself] to behold H7200 (8800) [the things that are] in heaven H8064, and in the earth H0776!
113:007 He raiseth up H6965 (8688) the poor H1800 out of the dust H6083, [and] lifteth H7311 (8686) the needy H0034 out of the dunghill H0830;
113:008 That he may set H3427 (8687) [him] with princes H5081, [even] with the princes H5081 of his people H5971.
113:009 He maketh the barren woman H6135 to keep H3427 (8688) house H1004, [and to be] a joyful H8056 mother H0517 of children H1121. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.
114:001 ¶  When Israel H3478 went out H3318 (8800) of Egypt H4714, the house H1004 of Jacob H3290 from a people H5971 of strange language H3937 (8802);
114:002 Judah H3063 was his sanctuary H6944, [and] Israel H3478 his dominion H4475.
114:003 The sea H3220 saw H7200 (8804) [it], and fled H5127 (8799): Jordan H3383 was driven H5437 (8735) back H0268.
114:004 The mountains H2022 skipped H7540 (8804) like rams H0352, [and] the little hills H1389 like lambs H1121 H6629.
114:005 What [ailed] thee, O thou sea H3220, that thou fleddest H5127 (8799)? thou Jordan H3383, [that] thou wast driven H5437 (8735) back H0268?
114:006 Ye mountains H2022, [that] ye skipped H7540 (8799) like rams H0352; [and] ye little hills H1389, like lambs H1121 H6629?
114:007 Tremble H2342 (8798), thou earth H0776, at the presence H6440 of the Lord H0113, at the presence H6440 of the God H0433 of Jacob H3290;
114:008 Which turned H2015 (8802) the rock H6697 [into] a standing H0098 water H4325, the flint H2496 into a fountain H4599 of waters H4325.
115:001 ¶  Not unto us, O LORD H3068, not unto us, but unto thy name H8034 give H5414 (8798) glory H3519, for thy mercy H2617, [and] for thy truth’s H0571 sake.
115:002 Wherefore should the heathen H1471 say H0559 (8799), Where [is] now their God H0430?
115:003 But our God H0430 [is] in the heavens H8064: he hath done H6213 (8804) whatsoever he hath pleased H2654 (8804).
115:004 Their idols H6091 [are] silver H3701 and gold H2091, the work H4639 of men’s H0120 hands H3027.
115:005 They have mouths H6310, but they speak H1696 (8762) not: eyes H5869 have they, but they see H7200 (8799) not:
115:006 They have ears H0241, but they hear H8085 (8799) not: noses H0639 have they, but they smell H7306 (8686) not:
115:007 They have hands H3027, but they handle H4184 (8686) not: feet H7272 have they, but they walk H1980 (8762) not: neither speak H1897 (8799) they through their throat H1627.
115:008 They that make H6213 (8802) them are like unto them; [so is] every one that trusteth H0982 (8802) in them.
115:009 O Israel H3478, trust H0982 (8798) thou in the LORD H3068: he [is] their help H5828 and their shield H4043.
115:010 O house H1004 of Aaron H0175, trust H0982 (8798) in the LORD H3068: he [is] their help H5828 and their shield H4043.
115:011 Ye that fear H3373 the LORD H3068, trust H0982 (8798) in the LORD H3068: he [is] their help H5828 and their shield H4043.
115:012 The LORD H3068 hath been mindful H2142 (8804) of us: he will bless H1288 (8762) [us]; he will bless H1288 (8762) the house H1004 of Israel H3478; he will bless H1288 (8762) the house H1004 of Aaron H0175.
115:013 He will bless H1288 (8762) them that fear H3373 the LORD H3068, [both] small H6996 and great H1419.
115:014 The LORD H3068 shall increase H3254 (8686) you more and more, you and your children H1121.
115:015 Ye [are] blessed H1288 (8803) of the LORD H3068 which made H6213 (8802) heaven H8064 and earth H0776.
115:016 The heaven H8064, [even] the heavens H8064, [are] the LORD’S H3068: but the earth H0776 hath he given H5414 (8804) to the children H1121 of men H0120.
115:017 The dead H4191 (8801) praise H1984 (8762) not the LORD H3050, neither any that go down H3381 (8802) into silence H1745.
115:018 But we will bless H1288 (8762) the LORD H3050 from this time forth and for H5704 evermore H5769. Praise H1984 (8761) the LORD H3050.
116:001 ¶  I love H0157 (8804) the LORD H3068, because he hath heard H8085 (8799) my voice H6963 [and] my supplications H8469.
116:002 Because he hath inclined H5186 (8689) his ear H0241 unto me, therefore will I call H7121 (8799) upon [him] as long as I live H3117.
116:003 The sorrows H2256 of death H4194 compassed H0661 (8804) me, and the pains H4712 of hell H7585 gat hold H4672 (8804) upon me: I found H4672 (8799) trouble H6869 and sorrow H3015.
116:004 Then called H7121 (8799) I upon the name H8034 of the LORD H3068; O LORD H3068, I beseech H0577 thee, deliver H4422 (8761) my soul H5315.
116:005 Gracious H2587 [is] the LORD H3068, and righteous H6662; yea, our God H0430 [is] merciful H7355 (8764).
116:006 The LORD H3068 preserveth H8104 (8802) the simple H6612: I was brought low H1809 (8804), and he helped H3467 (8686) me.
116:007 Return H7725 (8798) unto thy rest H4494, O my soul H5315; for the LORD H3068 hath dealt bountifully H1580 (8804) with thee.
116:008 For thou hast delivered H2502 (8765) my soul H5315 from death H4194, mine eyes H5869 from tears H1832, [and] my feet H7272 from falling H1762.
116:009 I will walk H1980 (8691) before H6440 the LORD H3068 in the land H0776 of the living H2416.
116:010 I believed H0539 (8689), therefore have I spoken H1696 (8762): I was greatly H3966 afflicted H6031 (8804):
116:011 I said H0559 (8804) in my haste H2648 (8800), All men H0120 [are] liars H3576 (8802).
116:012 What shall I render H7725 (8686) unto the LORD H3068 [for] all his benefits H8408 toward me?
116:013 I will take H5375 (8799) the cup H3563 of salvation H3444, and call H7121 (8799) upon the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
116:014 I will pay H7999 (8762) my vows H5088 unto the LORD H3068 now in the presence of all his people H5971.
116:015 Precious H3368 in the sight H5869 of the LORD H3068 [is] the death H4194 of his saints H2623.
116:016 O LORD H3068, truly H0577 I [am] thy servant H5650; I [am] thy servant H5650, [and] the son H1121 of thine handmaid H0519: thou hast loosed H6605 (8765) my bonds H4147.
116:017 I will offer H2076 (8799) to thee the sacrifice H2077 of thanksgiving H8426, and will call H7121 (8799) upon the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
116:018 I will pay H7999 (8762) my vows H5088 unto the LORD H3068 now in the presence of all his people H5971,
116:019 In the courts H2691 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004, in the midst H8432 of thee, O Jerusalem H3389. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.
117:001 ¶  O praise H1984 (8761) the LORD H3068, all ye nations H1471: praise H7623 (8761) him, all ye people H0523.
117:002 For his merciful H2617 kindness H2617 is great H1396 (8804) toward us: and the truth H0571 of the LORD H3068 [endureth] for ever H5769. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.
118:001 ¶  O give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the LORD H3068; for [he is] good H2896: because his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
118:002 Let Israel H3478 now say H0559 (8799), that his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
118:003 Let the house H1004 of Aaron H0175 now say H0559 (8799), that his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
118:004 Let them now that fear H3373 the LORD H3068 say H0559 (8799), that his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
118:005 I called H7121 (8804) upon the LORD H3050 in distress H4712: the LORD H3050 answered H6030 (8804) me, [and set me] in a large place H4800.
118:006 The LORD H3068 [is] on my side; I will not fear H3372 (8799): what can H6213 man H0120 do H6213 (8799) unto me?
118:007 The LORD H3068 taketh my part with them that help H5826 (8802) me: therefore shall I see H7200 (8799) [my desire] upon them that hate H8130 (8802) me.
118:008 [It is] better H2896 to trust H2620 (8800) in the LORD H3068 than to put confidence H0982 (8800) in man H0120.
118:009 [It is] better H2896 to trust H2620 (8800) in the LORD H3068 than to put confidence H0982 (8800) in princes H5081.
118:010 All nations H1471 compassed me about H5437 (8804): but in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 will I destroy H4135 (8686) them.
118:011 They compassed me about H5437 (8804); yea, they compassed me about H5437 (8804): but in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 I will destroy H4135 (8686) them.
118:012 They compassed me about H5437 (8804) like bees H1682; they are quenched H1846 (8795) as the fire H0784 of thorns H6975: for in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 I will destroy H4135 (8686) them.
118:013 Thou hast thrust H1760 (8804) sore H1760 (8800) at me that I might fall H5307 (8800): but the LORD H3068 helped H5826 (8804) me.
118:014 The LORD H3050 [is] my strength H5797 and song H2176, and is become my salvation H3444.
118:015 The voice H6963 of rejoicing H7440 and salvation H3444 [is] in the tabernacles H0168 of the righteous H6662: the right hand H3225 of the LORD H3068 doeth H6213 (8802) valiantly H2428.
118:016 The right hand H3225 of the LORD H3068 is exalted H7426 (8802): the right hand H3225 of the LORD H3068 doeth H6213 (8802) valiantly H2428.
118:017 I shall not die H4191 (8799), but live H2421 (8799), and declare H5608 (8762) the works H4639 of the LORD H3050.
118:018 The LORD H3050 hath chastened H3256 (8765) me sore H3256 (8763): but he hath not given me over H5414 (8804) unto death H4194.
118:019 Open H6605 (8798) to me the gates H8179 of righteousness H6664: I will go H0935 (8799) into them, [and] I will praise H3034 (8686) the LORD H3050:
118:020 This gate H8179 of the LORD H3068, into which the righteous H6662 shall enter H0935 (8799).
118:021 I will praise H3034 (8686) thee: for thou hast heard H6030 (8804) me, and art become my salvation H3444.
118:022 The stone H0068 [which] the builders H1129 (8802) refused H3988 (8804) is become the head H7218 [stone] of the corner H6438.
118:023 This is the LORD’S H3068 doing; it [is] marvellous H6381 (8738) in our eyes H5869.
118:024 This [is] the day H3117 [which] the LORD H3068 hath made H6213 (8804); we will rejoice H1523 (8799) and be glad H8055 (8799) in it.
118:025 Save H3467 (8685) now, I beseech H0577 thee, O LORD H3068: O LORD H3068, I beseech H0577 thee, send now prosperity H6743 (8685).
118:026 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] he that cometh H0935 (8802) in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068: we have blessed H1288 (8765) you out of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
118:027 God H0410 [is] the LORD H3068, which hath shewed us light H0215 (8686): bind H0631 (8798) the sacrifice H2282 with cords H5688, [even] unto the horns H7161 of the altar H4196.
118:028 Thou [art] my God H0410, and I will praise H3034 (8686) thee: [thou art] my God H0430, I will exalt H7311 (8787) thee.
118:029 O give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the LORD H3068; for [he is] good H2896: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
119:001 ¶  ALEPH. Blessed H0835 [are] the undefiled H8549 in the way H1870, who walk H1980 (8802) in the law H8451 of the LORD H3068.
119:002 Blessed H0835 [are] they that keep H5341 (8802) his testimonies H5713, [and that] seek H1875 (8799) him with the whole heart H3820.
119:003 They also do H6466 (8804) no iniquity H5766: they walk H1980 (8804) in his ways H1870.
119:004 Thou hast commanded H6680 (8765) [us] to keep H8104 (8800) thy precepts H6490 diligently H3966.
119:005 O that H0305 my ways H1870 were directed H3559 (8735) to keep H8104 (8800) thy statutes H2706!
119:006 Then shall I not be ashamed H0954 (8799), when I have respect H5027 (8687) unto all thy commandments H4687.
119:007 I will praise H3034 (8686) thee with uprightness H3476 of heart H3824, when I shall have learned H3925 (8800) thy righteous H6664 judgments H4941.
119:008 I will keep H8104 (8799) thy statutes H2706: O forsake H5800 (8799) me not utterly H3966.
119:009 BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man H5288 cleanse H2135 (8762) his way H0734? by taking heed H8104 (8800) [thereto] according to thy word H1697.
119:010 With my whole heart H3820 have I sought H1875 (8804) thee: O let me not wander H7686 (8686) from thy commandments H4687.
119:011 Thy word H0565 have I hid H6845 (8804) in mine heart H3820, that I might not sin H2398 (8799) against thee.
119:012 Blessed H1288 (8803) [art] thou, O LORD H3068: teach H3925 (8761) me thy statutes H2706.
119:013 With my lips H8193 have I declared H5608 (8765) all the judgments H4941 of thy mouth H6310.
119:014 I have rejoiced H7797 (8804) in the way H1870 of thy testimonies H5715, as [much as] in H5921 all riches H1952.
119:015 I will meditate H7878 (8799) in thy precepts H6490, and have respect H5027 (8686) unto thy ways H0734.
119:016 I will delight H8173 (8698) myself in thy statutes H2708: I will not forget H7911 (8799) thy word H1697.
119:017 GIMEL. Deal bountifully H1580 (8798) with thy servant H5650, [that] I may live H2421 (8799), and keep H8104 (8799) thy word H1697.
119:018 Open H1540 (8761) thou mine eyes H5869, that I may behold H5027 (8686) wondrous things H6381 (8737) out of thy law H8451.
119:019 I [am] a stranger H1616 in the earth H0776: hide H5641 (8686) not thy commandments H4687 from me.
119:020 My soul H5315 breaketh H1638 (8804) for the longing H8375 [that it hath] unto thy judgments H4941 at all times H6256.
119:021 Thou hast rebuked H1605 (8804) the proud H2086 [that are] cursed H0779 (8803), which do err H7686 (8802) from thy commandments H4687.
119:022 Remove H1556 (8798) from me reproach H2781 and contempt H0937; for I have kept H5341 (8804) thy testimonies H5713.
119:023 Princes H8269 also did sit H3427 (8804) [and] speak H1696 (8738) against me: [but] thy servant H5650 did meditate H7878 (8799) in thy statutes H2706.
119:024 Thy testimonies H5713 also [are] my delight H8191 [and] my counsellors H0582 H6098.
119:025 DALETH. My soul H5315 cleaveth H1692 (8804) unto the dust H6083: quicken H2421 (8761) thou me according to thy word H1697.
119:026 I have declared H5608 (8765) my ways H1870, and thou heardest H6030 (8799) me: teach H3925 (8761) me thy statutes H2706.
119:027 Make me to understand H0995 (8685) the way H1870 of thy precepts H6490: so shall I talk H7878 (8799) of thy wondrous works H6381 (8737).
119:028 My soul H5315 melteth H1811 (8804) for heaviness H8424: strengthen H6965 (8761) thou me according unto thy word H1697.
119:029 Remove H5493 (8685) from me the way H1870 of lying H8267: and grant me thy law H8451 graciously H2603 (8798).
119:030 I have chosen H0977 (8804) the way H1870 of truth H0530: thy judgments H4941 have I laid H7737 (8765) [before me].
119:031 I have stuck H1692 (8804) unto thy testimonies H5715: O LORD H3068, put me not to shame H0954 (8686).
119:032 I will run H7323 (8799) the way H1870 of thy commandments H4687, when thou shalt enlarge H7337 (8686) my heart H3820.
119:033 HE. Teach H3384 (8685) me, O LORD H3068, the way H1870 of thy statutes H2706; and I shall keep H5341 (8799) it [unto] the end H6118.
119:034 Give me understanding H0995 (8685), and I shall keep H5341 (8799) thy law H8451; yea, I shall observe H8104 (8799) it with [my] whole heart H3820.
119:035 Make me to go H1869 (8685) in the path H5410 of thy commandments H4687; for therein do I delight H2654 (8804).
119:036 Incline H5186 (8685) my heart H3820 unto thy testimonies H5715, and not to covetousness H1215.
119:037 Turn away H5674 (8685) mine eyes H5869 from beholding H7200 (8800) vanity H7723; [and] quicken H2421 (8761) thou me in thy way H1870.
119:038 Stablish H6965 (8685) thy word H0565 unto thy servant H5650, who [is devoted] to thy fear H3374.
119:039 Turn away H5674 (8685) my reproach H2781 which I fear H3025 (8804): for thy judgments H4941 [are] good H2896.
119:040 Behold, I have longed H8373 (8804) after thy precepts H6490: quicken H2421 (8761) me in thy righteousness H6666.
119:041 VAU. Let thy mercies H2617 come H0935 (8799) also unto me, O LORD H3068, [even] thy salvation H8668, according to thy word H0565.
119:042 So shall I have wherewith H1697 to answer H6030 (8799) him that reproacheth H2778 (8802) me: for I trust H0982 (8804) in thy word H1697.
119:043 And take H5337 (8686) not the word H1697 of truth H0571 utterly H3966 out of my mouth H6310; for I have hoped H3176 (8765) in thy judgments H4941.
119:044 So shall I keep H8104 (8799) thy law H8451 continually H8548 for ever H5769 and ever H5703.
119:045 And I will walk H1980 (8691) at liberty H7342: for I seek H1875 (8804) thy precepts H6490.
119:046 I will speak H1696 (8762) of thy testimonies H5713 also before kings H4428, and will not be ashamed H0954 (8799).
119:047 And I will delight H8173 (8698) myself in thy commandments H4687, which I have loved H0157 (8804).
119:048 My hands H3709 also will I lift up H5375 (8799) unto thy commandments H4687, which I have loved H0157 (8804); and I will meditate H7878 (8799) in thy statutes H2706.
119:049 ZAIN. Remember H2142 (8798) the word H1697 unto thy servant H5650, upon which thou hast caused me to hope H3176 (8765).
119:050 This [is] my comfort H5165 in my affliction H6040: for thy word H0565 hath quickened H2421 (8765) me.
119:051 The proud H2086 have had me greatly H3966 in derision H3887 (8689): [yet] have I not declined H5186 (8804) from thy law H8451.
119:052 I remembered H2142 (8804) thy judgments H4941 of old H5769, O LORD H3068; and have comforted H5162 (8691) myself.
119:053 Horror H2152 hath taken hold H0270 (8804) upon me because of the wicked H7563 that forsake H5800 (8802) thy law H8451.
119:054 Thy statutes H2706 have been my songs H2158 in the house H1004 of my pilgrimage H4033.
119:055 I have remembered H2142 (8804) thy name H8034, O LORD H3068, in the night H3915, and have kept H8104 (8799) thy law H8451.
119:056 This I had, because I kept H5341 (8804) thy precepts H6490.
119:057 CHETH. [Thou art] my portion H2506, O LORD H3068: I have said H0559 (8804) that I would keep H8104 (8800) thy words H1697.
119:058 I intreated H2470 (8765) thy favour H6440 with [my] whole heart H3820: be merciful H2603 (8798) unto me according to thy word H0565.
119:059 I thought H2803 (8765) on my ways H1870, and turned H7725 (8686) my feet H7272 unto thy testimonies H5713.
119:060 I made haste H2363 (8804), and delayed H4102 (8701) not to keep H8104 (8800) thy commandments H4687.
119:061 The bands H2256 of the wicked H7563 have robbed H5749 (8765) me: [but] I have not forgotten H7911 (8804) thy law H8451.
119:062 At midnight H2676 H3915 I will rise H6965 (8799) to give thanks H3034 (8687) unto thee because of thy righteous H6664 judgments H4941.
119:063 I [am] a companion H2270 of all [them] that fear H3372 (8804) thee, and of them that keep H8104 (8802) thy precepts H6490.
119:064 The earth H0776, O LORD H3068, is full H4390 (8804) of thy mercy H2617: teach H3925 (8761) me thy statutes H2706.
119:065 TETH. Thou hast dealt H6213 (8804) well H2896 with thy servant H5650, O LORD H3068, according unto thy word H1697.
119:066 Teach H3925 (8761) me good H2898 judgment H2940 and knowledge H1847: for I have believed H0539 (8689) thy commandments H4687.
119:067 Before I was afflicted H6031 (8799) I went astray H7683 (8802): but now have I kept H8104 (8804) thy word H0565.
119:068 Thou [art] good H2896, and doest good H2895 (8688); teach H3925 (8761) me thy statutes H2706.
119:069 The proud H2086 have forged H2950 (8804) a lie H8267 against me: [but] I will keep H5341 (8799) thy precepts H6490 with [my] whole heart H3820.
119:070 Their heart H3820 is as fat H2954 (8804) as grease H2459; [but] I delight H8173 (8773) in thy law H8451.
119:071 [It is] good H2896 for me that I have been afflicted H6031 (8795); that I might learn H3925 (8799) thy statutes H2706.
119:072 The law H8451 of thy mouth H6310 [is] better H2896 unto me than thousands H0505 of gold H2091 and silver H3701.
119:073 JOD. Thy hands H3027 have made H6213 (8804) me and fashioned H3559 (8787) me: give me understanding H0995 (8685), that I may learn H3925 (8799) thy commandments H4687.
119:074 They that fear H3373 thee will be glad H8055 (8799) when they see H7200 (8799) me; because I have hoped H3176 (8765) in thy word H1697.
119:075 I know H3045 (8804), O LORD H3068, that thy judgments H4941 [are] right H6664, and [that] thou in faithfulness H0530 hast afflicted H6031 (8765) me.
119:076 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness H2617 be for my comfort H5162 (8763), according to thy word H0565 unto thy servant H5650.
119:077 Let thy tender mercies H7356 come H0935 (8799) unto me, that I may live H2421 (8799): for thy law H8451 [is] my delight H8191.
119:078 Let the proud H2086 be ashamed H0954 (8799); for they dealt perversely H5791 (8765) with me without a cause H8267: [but] I will meditate H7878 (8799) in thy precepts H6490.
119:079 Let those that fear H3373 thee turn H7725 (8799) unto me, and those that have known H3045 (8802) (8675) H3045 (8804) thy testimonies H5713.
119:080 Let my heart H3820 be sound H8549 in thy statutes H2706; that I be not ashamed H0954 (8799).
119:081 CAPH. My soul H5315 fainteth H3615 (8804) for thy salvation H8668: [but] I hope H3176 (8765) in thy word H1697.
119:082 Mine eyes H5869 fail H3615 (8804) for thy word H0565, saying H0559 (8800), When wilt thou comfort H5162 (8762) me?
119:083 For I am become like a bottle H4997 in the smoke H7008; [yet] do I not forget H7911 (8804) thy statutes H2706.
119:084 How many [are] the days H3117 of thy servant H5650? when wilt thou execute H6213 (8799) judgment H4941 on them that persecute H7291 (8802) me?
119:085 The proud H2086 have digged H3738 (8804) pits H7882 for me, which [are] not after thy law H8451.
119:086 All thy commandments H4687 [are] faithful H0530: they persecute H7291 (8804) me wrongfully H8267; help H5826 (8798) thou me.
119:087 They had almost H4592 consumed H3615 (8765) me upon earth H0776; but I forsook H5800 (8804) not thy precepts H6490.
119:088 Quicken H2421 (8761) me after thy lovingkindness H2617; so shall I keep H8104 (8799) the testimony H5715 of thy mouth H6310.
119:089 LAMED. For ever H5769, O LORD H3068, thy word H1697 is settled H5324 (8737) in heaven H8064.
119:090 Thy faithfulness H0530 [is] unto all H1755 generations H1755: thou hast established H3559 (8790) the earth H0776, and it abideth H5975 (8799).
119:091 They continue H5975 (8804) this day H3117 according to thine ordinances H4941: for all [are] thy servants H5650.
119:092 Unless H3884 thy law H8451 [had been] my delights H8191, I should then have perished H0006 (8804) in mine affliction H6040.
119:093 I will never H5769 forget H7911 (8799) thy precepts H6490: for with them thou hast quickened H2421 (8765) me.
119:094 I [am] thine, save H3467 (8685) me; for I have sought H1875 (8804) thy precepts H6490.
119:095 The wicked H7563 have waited H6960 (8765) for me to destroy H0006 (8763) me: [but] I will consider H0995 (8709) thy testimonies H5713.
119:096 I have seen H7200 (8804) an end H7093 of all perfection H8502: [but] thy commandment H4687 [is] exceeding H3966 broad H7342.
119:097 MEM. O how love I H0157 (8804) thy law H8451! it [is] my meditation H7881 all the day H3117.
119:098 Thou through thy commandments H4687 hast made me wiser H2449 (8762) than mine enemies H0341 (8802): for they [are] ever H5769 with me.
119:099 I have more understanding H7919 (8689) than all my teachers H3925 (8764): for thy testimonies H5715 [are] my meditation H7881.
119:100 I understand H0995 (8709) more than the ancients H2205, because I keep H5341 (8804) thy precepts H6490.
119:101 I have refrained H3607 (8804) my feet H7272 from every evil H7451 way H0734, that I might keep H8104 (8799) thy word H1697.
119:102 I have not departed H5493 (8804) from thy judgments H4941: for thou hast taught H3384 (8689) me.
119:103 How sweet H4452 (8738) are thy words H0565 unto my taste H2441! [yea, sweeter] than honey H1706 to my mouth H6310!
119:104 Through thy precepts H6490 I get understanding H0995 (8709): therefore I hate H8130 (8804) every false H8267 way H0734.
119:105 NUN. Thy word H1697 [is] a lamp H5216 unto my feet H7272, and a light H0216 unto my path H5410.
119:106 I have sworn H7650 (8738), and I will perform H6965 (8762) [it], that I will keep H8104 (8800) thy righteous H6664 judgments H4941.
119:107 I am afflicted H6031 (8738) very much H3966: quicken H2421 (8761) me, O LORD H3068, according unto thy word H1697.
119:108 Accept H7521 (8798), I beseech thee, the freewill offerings H5071 of my mouth H6310, O LORD H3068, and teach H3925 (8761) me thy judgments H4941.
119:109 My soul H5315 [is] continually H8548 in my hand H3709: yet do I not forget H7911 (8804) thy law H8451.
119:110 The wicked H7563 have laid H5414 (8804) a snare H6341 for me: yet I erred H8582 (8804) not from thy precepts H6490.
119:111 Thy testimonies H5715 have I taken as an heritage H5157 (8804) for ever H5769: for they [are] the rejoicing H8342 of my heart H3820.
119:112 I have inclined H5186 (8804) mine heart H3820 to perform H6213 (8800) thy statutes H2706 alway H5769, [even unto] the end H6118.
119:113 SAMECH. I hate H8130 (8804) [vain] thoughts H5588: but thy law H8451 do I love H0157 (8804).
119:114 Thou [art] my hiding place H5643 and my shield H4043: I hope H3176 (8765) in thy word H1697.
119:115 Depart H5493 (8798) from me, ye evildoers H7489 (8688): for I will keep H5341 (8799) the commandments H4687 of my God H0430.
119:116 Uphold H5564 (8798) me according unto thy word H0565, that I may live H2421 (8799): and let me not be ashamed H0954 (8686) of my hope H7664.
119:117 Hold thou me up H5582 (8798), and I shall be safe H3467 (8735): and I will have respect H8159 (8799) unto thy statutes H2706 continually H8548.
119:118 Thou hast trodden down H5541 (8804) all them that err H7686 (8802) from thy statutes H2706: for their deceit H8649 [is] falsehood H8267.
119:119 Thou puttest away H7673 (8689) all the wicked H7563 of the earth H0776 [like] dross H5509: therefore I love H0157 (8804) thy testimonies H5713.
119:120 My flesh H1320 trembleth H5568 (8804) for fear H6343 of thee; and I am afraid H3372 (8804) of thy judgments H4941.
119:121 AIN. I have done H6213 (8804) judgment H4941 and justice H6664: leave H3240 (8686) me not to mine oppressors H6231 (8802).
119:122 Be surety H6148 (8798) for thy servant H5650 for good H2896: let not the proud H2086 oppress H6231 (8799) me.
119:123 Mine eyes H5869 fail H3615 (8804) for thy salvation H3444, and for the word H0565 of thy righteousness H6664.
119:124 Deal H6213 (8798) with thy servant H5650 according unto thy mercy H2617, and teach H3925 (8761) me thy statutes H2706.
119:125 I [am] thy servant H5650; give me understanding H0995 (8685), that I may know H3045 (8799) thy testimonies H5713.
119:126 [It is] time H6256 for [thee], LORD H3068, to work H6213 (8800): [for] they have made void H6565 (8689) thy law H8451.
119:127 Therefore I love H0157 (8804) thy commandments H4687 above gold H2091; yea, above fine gold H6337.
119:128 Therefore I esteem all [thy] precepts H6490 [concerning] all [things to be] right H3474 (8765); [and] I hate H8130 (8804) every false H8267 way H0734.
119:129 PE. Thy testimonies H5715 [are] wonderful H6382: therefore doth my soul H5315 keep H5341 (8804) them.
119:130 The entrance H6608 of thy words H1697 giveth light H0215 (8686); it giveth understanding H0995 (8688) unto the simple H6612.
119:131 I opened H6473 (8804) my mouth H6310, and panted H7602 (8799): for I longed H2968 (8804) for thy commandments H4687.
119:132 Look H6437 (8798) thou upon me, and be merciful H2603 (8798) unto me, as thou usest H4941 to do unto those that love H0157 (8802) thy name H8034.
119:133 Order H3559 (8685) my steps H6471 in thy word H0565: and let not any iniquity H0205 have dominion H7980 (8686) over me.
119:134 Deliver H6299 (8798) me from the oppression H6233 of man H0120: so will I keep H8104 (8799) thy precepts H6490.
119:135 Make thy face H6440 to shine H0215 (8685) upon thy servant H5650; and teach H3925 (8761) me thy statutes H2706.
119:136 Rivers H6388 of waters H4325 run down H3381 (8804) mine eyes H5869, because they keep H8104 (8804) not thy law H8451.
119:137 TZADDI. Righteous H6662 [art] thou, O LORD H3068, and upright H3477 [are] thy judgments H4941.
119:138 Thy testimonies H5713 [that] thou hast commanded H6680 (8765) [are] righteous H6664 and very H3966 faithful H0530.
119:139 My zeal H7068 hath consumed H6789 (8765) me, because mine enemies H6862 have forgotten H7911 (8804) thy words H1697.
119:140 Thy word H0565 [is] very H3966 pure H6884 (8803): therefore thy servant H5650 loveth H0157 (8804) it.
119:141 I [am] small H6810 and despised H0959 (8737): [yet] do not I forget H7911 (8804) thy precepts H6490.
119:142 Thy righteousness H6666 [is] an everlasting H5769 righteousness H6664, and thy law H8451 [is] the truth H0571.
119:143 Trouble H6862 and anguish H4689 have taken hold H4672 (8804) on me: [yet] thy commandments H4687 [are] my delights H8191.
119:144 The righteousness H6664 of thy testimonies H5715 [is] everlasting H5769: give me understanding H0995 (8685), and I shall live H2421 (8799).
119:145 KOPH. I cried H7121 (8804) with [my] whole heart H3820; hear H6030 (8798) me, O LORD H3068: I will keep H5341 (8799) thy statutes H2706.
119:146 I cried H7121 (8804) unto thee; save H3467 (8685) me, and I shall keep H8104 (8799) thy testimonies H5713.
119:147 I prevented H6923 (8765) the dawning of the morning H5399, and cried H7768 (8762): I hoped H3176 (8765) in thy word H1697.
119:148 Mine eyes H5869 prevent H6923 (8765) the [night] watches H0821, that I might meditate H7878 (8800) in thy word H0565.
119:149 Hear H8085 (8798) my voice H6963 according unto thy lovingkindness H2617: O LORD H3068, quicken H2421 (8761) me according to thy judgment H4941.
119:150 They draw nigh H7126 (8804) that follow H7291 (8802) after mischief H2154: they are far H7368 (8804) from thy law H8451.
119:151 Thou [art] near H7138, O LORD H3068; and all thy commandments H4687 [are] truth H0571.
119:152 Concerning thy testimonies H5713, I have known H3045 (8804) of old H6924 that thou hast founded H3245 (8804) them for ever H5769.
119:153 RESH. Consider H7200 (8798) mine affliction H6040, and deliver H2502 (8761) me: for I do not forget H7911 (8804) thy law H8451.
119:154 Plead H7378 (8798) my cause H7379, and deliver H1350 (8798) me: quicken H2421 (8761) me according to thy word H0565.
119:155 Salvation H3444 [is] far H7350 from the wicked H7563: for they seek H1875 (8804) not thy statutes H2706.
119:156 Great H7227 [are] thy tender mercies H7356, O LORD H3068: quicken H2421 (8761) me according to thy judgments H4941.
119:157 Many H7227 [are] my persecutors H7291 (8802) and mine enemies H6862; [yet] do I not decline H5186 (8804) from thy testimonies H5715.
119:158 I beheld H7200 (8804) the transgressors H0898 (8802), and was grieved H6962 (8709); because they kept H8104 (8804) not thy word H0565.
119:159 Consider H7200 (8798) how I love H0157 (8804) thy precepts H6490: quicken H2421 (8761) me, O LORD H3068, according to thy lovingkindness H2617.
119:160 Thy word H1697 [is] true H0571 [from] the beginning H7218: and every one of thy righteous H6664 judgments H4941 [endureth] for ever H5769.
119:161 SCHIN. Princes H8269 have persecuted H7291 (8804) me without a cause H2600: but my heart H3820 standeth in awe H6342 (8804) of thy word H1697.
119:162 I rejoice H7797 (8801) at thy word H0565, as one that findeth H4672 (8802) great H7227 spoil H7998.
119:163 I hate H8130 (8804) and abhor H8581 (8762) lying H8267: [but] thy law H8451 do I love H0157 (8804).
119:164 Seven times H7651 a day H3117 do I praise H1984 (8765) thee because of thy righteous H6664 judgments H4941.
119:165 Great H7227 peace H7965 have they which love H0157 (8802) thy law H8451: and nothing shall offend H4383 them.
119:166 LORD H3068, I have hoped H7663 (8765) for thy salvation H3444, and done H6213 (8804) thy commandments H4687.
119:167 My soul H5315 hath kept H8104 (8804) thy testimonies H5713; and I love H0157 (8799) them exceedingly H3966.
119:168 I have kept H8104 (8804) thy precepts H6490 and thy testimonies H5713: for all my ways H1870 [are] before thee.
119:169 TAU. Let my cry H7440 come near H7126 (8799) before H6440 thee, O LORD H3068: give me understanding H0995 (8685) according to thy word H1697.
119:170 Let my supplication H8467 come H0935 (8799) before H6440 thee: deliver H5337 (8685) me according to thy word H0565.
119:171 My lips H8193 shall utter H5042 (8686) praise H8416, when thou hast taught H3925 (8762) me thy statutes H2706.
119:172 My tongue H3956 shall speak H6030 (8799) of thy word H0565: for all thy commandments H4687 [are] righteousness H6664.
119:173 Let thine hand H3027 help H5826 (8800) me; for I have chosen H0977 (8804) thy precepts H6490.
119:174 I have longed H8373 (8804) for thy salvation H3444, O LORD H3068; and thy law H8451 [is] my delight H8191.
119:175 Let my soul H5315 live H2421 (8799), and it shall praise H1984 (8762) thee; and let thy judgments H4941 help H5826 (8799) me.
119:176 I have gone astray H8582 (8804) like a lost H0006 (8802) sheep H7716; seek H1245 (8761) thy servant H5650; for I do not forget H7911 (8804) thy commandments H4687.
120:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609.» In my distress H6869 I cried H7121 (8804) unto the LORD H3068, and he heard H6030 (8799) me.
120:002 Deliver H5337 (8685) my soul H5315, O LORD H3068, from lying H8267 lips H8193, [and] from a deceitful H7423 tongue H3956.
120:003 What shall be given H5414 (8799) unto thee? or what shall be done H3254 (8686) unto thee, thou false H7423 tongue H3956?
120:004 Sharp H8150 (8802) arrows H2671 of the mighty H1368, with coals H1513 of juniper H7574.
120:005 Woe H0190 is me, that I sojourn H1481 (8804) in Mesech H4902, [that] I dwell H7931 (8804) in the tents H0168 of Kedar H6938!
120:006 My soul H5315 hath long H7227 dwelt H7931 (8804) with him that hateth H8130 (8802) peace H7965.
120:007 I [am for] peace H7965: but when I speak H1696 (8762), they [are] for war H4421.
121:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609.» I will lift up H5375 (8799) mine eyes H5869 unto the hills H2022, from whence H0370 cometh H0935 (8799) my help H5828.
121:002 My help H5828 [cometh] from the LORD H3068, which made H6213 (8802) heaven H8064 and earth H0776.
121:003 He will not suffer H5414 (8799) thy foot H7272 to be moved H4132: he that keepeth H8104 (8802) thee will not slumber H5123 (8799).
121:004 Behold, he that keepeth H8104 (8802) Israel H3478 shall neither slumber H5123 (8799) nor sleep H3462 (8799).
121:005 The LORD H3068 [is] thy keeper H8104 (8802): the LORD H3068 [is] thy shade H6738 upon thy right H3225 hand H3027.
121:006 The sun H8121 shall not smite H5221 (8686) thee by day H3119, nor the moon H3394 by night H3915.
121:007 The LORD H3068 shall preserve H8104 (8799) thee from all evil H7451: he shall preserve H8104 (8799) thy soul H5315.
121:008 The LORD H3068 shall preserve H8104 (8799) thy going out H3318 (8800) and thy coming in H0935 (8800) from this time forth, and even for H5704 evermore H5769.
122:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609 of David H1732.» I was glad H8055 (8804) when they said H0559 (8802) unto me, Let us go H3212 (8799) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
122:002 Our feet H7272 shall stand H5975 (8802) within thy gates H8179, O Jerusalem H3389.
122:003 Jerusalem H3389 is builded H1129 (8803) as a city H5892 that is compact H2266 (8795) together H3162:
122:004 Whither H8033 the tribes H7626 go up H5927 (8804), the tribes H7626 of the LORD H3050, unto the testimony H5715 of Israel H3478, to give thanks H3034 (8687) unto the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
122:005 For there are set H3427 (8804) thrones H3678 of judgment H4941, the thrones H3678 of the house H1004 of David H1732.
122:006 Pray H7592 (8798) for the peace H7965 of Jerusalem H3389: they shall prosper H7951 (8799) that love H0157 (8802) thee.
122:007 Peace H7965 be within thy walls H2426, [and] prosperity H7962 within thy palaces H0759.
122:008 For my brethren H0251 and companions H7453 ’ sakes, I will now say H1696 (8762), Peace H7965 [be] within thee.
122:009 Because of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 our God H0430 I will seek H1245 (8762) thy good H2896.
123:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609.» Unto thee lift I up H5375 (8804) mine eyes H5869, O thou that dwellest H3427 (8802) in the heavens H8064.
123:002 Behold, as the eyes H5869 of servants H5650 [look] unto the hand H3027 of their masters H0113, [and] as the eyes H5869 of a maiden H8198 unto the hand H3027 of her mistress H1404; so our eyes H5869 [wait] upon the LORD H3068 our God H0430, until that he have mercy H2603 (8799) upon us.
123:003 Have mercy H2603 (8798) upon us, O LORD H3068, have mercy H2603 (8798) upon us: for we are exceedingly H7227 filled H7646 (8804) with contempt H0937.
123:004 Our soul H5315 is exceedingly H7227 filled H7646 (8804) with the scorning H3933 of those that are at ease H7600, [and] with the contempt H0937 of the proud H3238 (8802) (8678) H1343 (8675) H1349.
124:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609 of David H1732.» If H3884 [it had not been] the LORD H3068 who was on our side, now may Israel H3478 say H0559 (8799);
124:002 If H3884 [it had not been] the LORD H3068 who was on our side, when men H0120 rose up H6965 (8800) against us:
124:003 Then H0233 they had swallowed us up H1104 (8804) quick H2416, when their wrath H0639 was kindled H2734 (8800) against us:
124:004 Then H0233 the waters H4325 had overwhelmed H7857 (8804) us, the stream H5158 had gone over H5674 (8804) our soul H5315:
124:005 Then H0233 the proud H2121 waters H4325 had gone over H5674 (8804) our soul H5315.
124:006 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068, who hath not given H5414 (8804) us [as] a prey H2964 to their teeth H8127.
124:007 Our soul H5315 is escaped H4422 (8738) as a bird H6833 out of the snare H6341 of the fowlers H3369 (8802): the snare H6341 is broken H7665 (8738), and we are escaped H4422 (8738).
124:008 Our help H5828 [is] in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, who made H6213 (8802) heaven H8064 and earth H0776.
125:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609.» They that trust H0982 (8802) in the LORD H3068 [shall be] as mount H2022 Zion H6726, [which] cannot be removed H4131 (8735), [but] abideth H3427 (8799) for ever H5769.
125:002 As the mountains H2022 [are] round about H5439 Jerusalem H3389, so the LORD H3068 [is] round about H5439 his people H5971 from henceforth even for H5704 ever H5769.
125:003 For the rod H7626 of the wicked H7562 shall not rest H5117 (8799) upon the lot H1486 of the righteous H6662; lest H4616 the righteous H6662 put forth H7971 (8799) their hands H3027 unto iniquity H5766.
125:004 Do good H2895 (8685), O LORD H3068, unto [those that be] good H2896, and [to them that are] upright H3477 in their hearts H3826.
125:005 As for such as turn aside H5186 (8688) unto their crooked ways H6128, the LORD H3068 shall lead them forth H3212 (8686) with the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205: [but] peace H7965 [shall be] upon Israel H3478.
126:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609.» When the LORD H3068 turned again H7725 (8800) the captivity H7870 of Zion H6726, we were like them that dream H2492 (8802).
126:002 Then was our mouth H6310 filled H4390 (8735) with laughter H7814, and our tongue H3956 with singing H7440: then said H0559 (8799) they among the heathen H1471, The LORD H3068 hath done H6213 (8800) great things H1431 (8689) for them.
126:003 The LORD H3068 hath done H6213 (8800) great things H1431 (8689) for us; [whereof] we are glad H8056.
126:004 Turn again H7725 (8798) our captivity H7622 (8675) H7622, O LORD H3068, as the streams H0650 in the south H5045.
126:005 They that sow H2232 (8802) in tears H1832 shall reap H7114 (8799) in joy H7440.
126:006 He that goeth H3212 (8799) forth H1980 (8800) and weepeth H1058 (8800), bearing H5375 (8802) precious H4901 seed H2233, shall doubtless H0935 (8800) come H0935 (8799) again with rejoicing H7440, bringing H5375 (8802) his sheaves H0485 [with him].
127:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609 for Solomon H8010.» Except the LORD H3068 build H1129 (8799) the house H1004, they labour H5998 (8804) in vain H7723 that build H1129 (8802) it: except the LORD H3068 keep H8104 (8799) the city H5892, the watchman H8104 (8802) waketh H8245 (8804) [but] in vain H7723.
127:002 [It is] vain H7723 for you to rise up H6965 (8800) early H7925 (8688), to sit up H3427 (8800) late H0309 (8764), to eat H0398 (8802) the bread H3899 of sorrows H6089: [for] so he giveth H5414 (8799) his beloved H3039 sleep H8142.
127:003 Lo, children H1121 [are] an heritage H5159 of the LORD H3068: [and] the fruit H6529 of the womb H0990 [is his] reward H7939.
127:004 As arrows H2671 [are] in the hand H3027 of a mighty man H1368; so [are] children H1121 of the youth H5271.
127:005 Happy H0835 [is] the man H1397 that hath his quiver H0827 full H4390 (8765) of them: they shall not be ashamed H0954 (8799), but they shall speak H1696 (8762) with the enemies H0341 (8802) in the gate H8179.
128:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609.» Blessed H0835 [is] every one that feareth H3373 the LORD H3068; that walketh H1980 (8802) in his ways H1870.
128:002 For thou shalt eat H0398 (8799) the labour H3018 of thine hands H3709: happy H0835 [shalt] thou [be], and [it shall be] well H2896 with thee.
128:003 Thy wife H0802 [shall be] as a fruitful H6509 (8802) vine H1612 by the sides H3411 of thine house H1004: thy children H1121 like olive H2132 plants H8363 round about H5439 thy table H7979.
128:004 Behold, that thus shall the man H1397 be blessed H1288 (8792) that feareth H3373 the LORD H3068.
128:005 The LORD H3068 shall bless H1288 (8762) thee out of Zion H6726: and thou shalt see H7200 (8798) the good H2898 of Jerusalem H3389 all the days H3117 of thy life H2416.
128:006 Yea, thou shalt see H7200 (8798) thy children’s H1121 children H1121, [and] peace H7965 upon Israel H3478.

129:002 Many a time H7227 have they afflicted H6887 (8804) me from my youth H5271: yet they have not prevailed H3201 (8804) against me.
129:003 The plowers H2790 (8802) plowed H2790 (8804) upon my back H1354: they made long H0748 (8689) their furrows H4618 (8675) H4618.
129:004 The LORD H3068 [is] righteous H6662: he hath cut asunder H7112 (8765) the cords H5688 of the wicked H7563.
129:005 Let them all be confounded H0954 (8799) and turned H5472 (8735) back H0268 that hate H8130 (8802) Zion H6726.
129:006 Let them be as the grass H2682 [upon] the housetops H1406, which withereth H3001 (8804) afore H6927 it groweth up H8025 (8804):
129:007 Wherewith the mower H7114 (8802) filleth H4390 (8765) not his hand H3709; nor he that bindeth sheaves H6014 (8764) his bosom H2683.
129:008 Neither do they which go by H5674 (8802) say H0559 (8804), The blessing H1293 of the LORD H3068 [be] upon you: we bless H1288 (8765) you in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
130:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609.» Out of the depths H4615 have I cried H7121 (8804) unto thee, O LORD H3068.
130:002 Lord H0136, hear H8085 (8798) my voice H6963: let thine ears H0241 be attentive H7183 to the voice H6963 of my supplications H8469.
130:003 If thou, LORD H3050, shouldest mark H8104 (8799) iniquities H5771, O Lord H0136, who shall stand H5975 (8799)?
130:004 But [there is] forgiveness H5547 with thee, that thou mayest be feared H3372 (8735).
130:005 I wait H6960 (8765) for the LORD H3068, my soul H5315 doth wait H6960 (8765), and in his word H1697 do I hope H3176 (8689).
130:006 My soul H5315 [waiteth] for the Lord H0136 more than they that watch H8104 (8802) for the morning H1242: [I say, more than] they that watch H8104 (8802) for the morning H1242.
130:007 Let Israel H3478 hope H3176 (8761) in the LORD H3068: for with the LORD H3068 [there is] mercy H2617, and with him [is] plenteous H7235 (8687) redemption H6304.
130:008 And he shall redeem H6299 (8799) Israel H3478 from all his iniquities H5771.
131:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609 of David H1732.» LORD H3068, my heart H3820 is not haughty H1361 (8804), nor mine eyes H5869 lofty H7311 (8804): neither do I exercise H1980 (8765) myself in great matters H1419, or in things too high H6381 (8737) for me.
131:002 Surely I have behaved H7737 (8765) and quieted H1826 (8776) myself H5315, as a child that is weaned H1580 (8803) of his mother H0517: my soul H5315 [is] even as a weaned child H1580 (8803).

132:002 How he sware H7650 (8738) unto the LORD H3068, [and] vowed H5087 (8804) unto the mighty H0046 [God] of Jacob H3290;
132:003 Surely I will not come H0935 (8799) into the tabernacle H0168 of my house H1004, nor go up H5927 (8799) into my bed H6210 H3326;
132:004 I will not give H5414 (8799) sleep H8153 to mine eyes H5869, [or] slumber H8572 to mine eyelids H6079,
132:005 Until I find out H4672 (8799) a place H4725 for the LORD H3068, an habitation H4908 for the mighty H0046 [God] of Jacob H3290.
132:006 Lo, we heard H8085 (8804) of it at Ephratah H0672: we found H4672 (8804) it in the fields H7704 of the wood H3293.
132:007 We will go H0935 (8799) into his tabernacles H4908: we will worship H7812 (8691) at his footstool H1916 H7272.
132:008 Arise H6965 (8798), O LORD H3068, into thy rest H4496; thou, and the ark H0727 of thy strength H5797.
132:009 Let thy priests H3548 be clothed H3847 (8799) with righteousness H6664; and let thy saints H2623 shout for joy H7442 (8762).
132:010 For thy servant H5650 David’s H1732 sake turn not away H7725 (8686) the face H6440 of thine anointed H4899.
132:011 The LORD H3068 hath sworn H7650 (8738) [in] truth H0571 unto David H1732; he will not turn H7725 (8799) from it; Of the fruit H6529 of thy body H0990 will I set H7896 (8799) upon thy throne H3678.
132:012 If thy children H1121 will keep H8104 (8799) my covenant H1285 and my testimony H5713 that H2090 (8675) H2097 I shall teach H3925 (8762) them, their children H1121 shall also sit H3427 (8799) upon thy throne H3678 for evermore H5703.
132:013 For the LORD H3068 hath chosen H0977 (8804) Zion H6726; he hath desired H0183 (8765) [it] for his habitation H4186.
132:014 This [is] my rest H4496 for ever H5703: here will I dwell H3427 (8799); for I have desired H0183 (8765) it.
132:015 I will abundantly H1288 (8763) bless H1288 (8762) her provision H6718: I will satisfy H7646 (8686) her poor H0034 with bread H3899.
132:016 I will also clothe H3847 (8686) her priests H3548 with salvation H3468: and her saints H2623 shall shout aloud H7442 (8762) for joy H7444 (8763).
132:017 There will I make H6779 the horn H7161 of David H1732 to bud H6779 (8686): I have ordained H6186 (8804) a lamp H5216 for mine anointed H4899.
132:018 His enemies H0341 (8802) will I clothe H3847 (8686) with shame H1322: but upon himself shall his crown H5145 flourish H6692 (8686).
133:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609 of David H1732.» Behold, how good H2896 and how pleasant H5273 [it is] for brethren H0251 to dwell H3427 (8800) together H3162 in unity H3162!
133:002 [It is] like the precious H2896 ointment H8081 upon the head H7218, that ran down H3381 (8802) upon the beard H2206, [even] Aaron’s H0175 beard H2206: that went down H3381 (8802) to the skirts H6310 of his garments H4060;
133:003 As the dew H2919 of Hermon H2768, [and as the dew] that descended H3381 (8802) upon the mountains H2042 of Zion H6726: for there the LORD H3068 commanded H6680 (8765) the blessing H1293, [even] life H2416 for evermore H5769.
134:001 ¶  «A Song H7892 of degrees H4609.» Behold, bless H1288 (8761) ye the LORD H3068, all [ye] servants H5650 of the LORD H3068, which by night H3915 stand H5975 (8802) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
134:002 Lift up H5375 (8798) your hands H3027 [in] the sanctuary H6944, and bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068.
134:003 The LORD H3068 that made H6213 (8802) heaven H8064 and earth H0776 bless H1288 (8762) thee out of Zion H6726.
135:001 ¶  Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the name H8034 of the LORD H3068; praise H1984 (8761) [him], O ye servants H5650 of the LORD H3068.
135:002 Ye that stand H5975 (8802) in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, in the courts H2691 of the house H1004 of our God H0430,
135:003 Praise H1984 (8761) the LORD H3050; for the LORD H3068 [is] good H2896: sing praises H2167 (8761) unto his name H8034; for [it is] pleasant H5273.
135:004 For the LORD H3050 hath chosen H0977 (8804) Jacob H3290 unto himself, [and] Israel H3478 for his peculiar treasure H5459.
135:005 For I know H3045 (8804) that the LORD H3068 [is] great H1419, and [that] our Lord H0113 [is] above all gods H0430.
135:006 Whatsoever the LORD H3068 pleased H2654 (8804), [that] did H6213 (8804) he in heaven H8064, and in earth H0776, in the seas H3220, and all deep places H8415.
135:007 He causeth the vapours H5387 to ascend H5927 (8688) from the ends H7097 of the earth H0776; he maketh H6213 (8804) lightnings H1300 for the rain H4306; he bringeth H3318 (8688) the wind H7307 out of his treasuries H0214.
135:008 Who smote H5221 (8689) the firstborn H1060 of Egypt H4714, both of man H0120 and beast H0929.
135:009 [Who] sent H7971 (8804) tokens H0226 and wonders H4159 into the midst H8432 of thee, O Egypt H4714, upon Pharaoh H6547, and upon all his servants H5650.
135:010 Who smote H5221 (8689) great H7227 nations H1471, and slew H2026 (8804) mighty H6099 kings H4428;
135:011 Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567, and Og H5747 king H4428 of Bashan H1316, and all the kingdoms H4467 of Canaan H3667:
135:012 And gave H5414 (8804) their land H0776 [for] an heritage H5159, an heritage H5159 unto Israel H3478 his people H5971.
135:013 Thy name H8034, O LORD H3068, [endureth] for ever H5769; [and] thy memorial H2143, O LORD H3068, throughout all H1755 generations H1755.
135:014 For the LORD H3068 will judge H1777 (8799) his people H5971, and he will repent H5162 (8691) himself concerning his servants H5650.
135:015 The idols H6091 of the heathen H1471 [are] silver H3701 and gold H2091, the work H4639 of men’s H0120 hands H3027.
135:016 They have mouths H6310, but they speak H1696 (8762) not; eyes H5869 have they, but they see H7200 (8799) not;
135:017 They have ears H0241, but they hear H0238 (8686) not; neither is there H3426 [any] breath H7307 in their mouths H6310.
135:018 They that make H6213 (8802) them are like unto them: [so is] every one that trusteth H0982 (8802) in them.
135:019 Bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068, O house H1004 of Israel H3478: bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068, O house H1004 of Aaron H0175:
135:020 Bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068, O house H1004 of Levi H3878: ye that fear H3373 the LORD H3068, bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068.
135:021 Blessed H1288 (8803) be the LORD H3068 out of Zion H6726, which dwelleth H7931 (8802) at Jerusalem H3389. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.
136:001 ¶  O give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the LORD H3068; for [he is] good H2896: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:002 O give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the God H0430 of gods H0430: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:003 O give thanks H3034 (8685) to the Lord H0113 of lords H0113: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:004 To him who alone doeth H6213 (8802) great H1419 wonders H6381 (8737): for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:005 To him that by wisdom H8394 made H6213 (8802) the heavens H8064: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:006 To him that stretched out H7554 (8802) the earth H0776 above the waters H4325: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:007 To him that made H6213 (8802) great H1419 lights H0216: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:008 The sun H8121 to rule H4475 by day H3117: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:009 The moon H3394 and stars H3556 to rule H4475 by night H3915: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:010 To him that smote H5221 (8688) Egypt H4714 in their firstborn H1060: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:011 And brought out H3318 (8686) Israel H3478 from among H8432 them: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:012 With a strong H2389 hand H3027, and with a stretched out H5186 (8803) arm H2220: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:013 To him which divided H1504 (8802) the Red H5488 sea H3220 into parts H1506: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:014 And made Israel H3478 to pass through H5674 (8689) the midst H8432 of it: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:015 But overthrew H5287 (8765) Pharaoh H6547 and his host H2428 in the Red H5488 sea H3220: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:016 To him which led H3212 (8688) his people H5971 through the wilderness H4057: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:017 To him which smote H5221 (8688) great H1419 kings H4428: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:018 And slew H2026 (8799) famous H0117 kings H4428: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:019 Sihon H5511 king H4428 of the Amorites H0567: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:020 And Og H5747 the king H4428 of Bashan H1316: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:021 And gave H5414 (8804) their land H0776 for an heritage H5159: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:022 [Even] an heritage H5159 unto Israel H3478 his servant H5650: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:023 Who remembered H2142 (8804) us in our low estate H8216: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769:
136:024 And hath redeemed H6561 (8799) us from our enemies H6862: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:025 Who giveth H5414 (8802) food H3899 to all flesh H1320: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
136:026 O give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the God H0410 of heaven H8064: for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
137:001 ¶  By the rivers H5104 of Babylon H0894, there we sat down H3427 (8804), yea, we wept H1058 (8804), when we remembered H2142 (8800) Zion H6726.
137:002 We hanged H8518 (8804) our harps H3658 upon the willows H6155 in the midst H8432 thereof.
137:003 For there they that carried us away captive H7617 (8802) required H7592 (8804) of us a song H1697 H7892; and they that wasted H8437 us [required of us] mirth H8057, [saying], Sing H7891 (8798) us [one] of the songs H7892 of Zion H6726.
137:004 How shall we sing H7891 (8799) the LORD’S H3068 song H7892 in a strange H5236 land H0127?
137:005 If I forget H7911 (8799) thee, O Jerusalem H3389, let my right hand H3225 forget H7911 (8799) [her cunning].
137:006 If I do not remember H2142 (8799) thee, let my tongue H3956 cleave H1692 (8799) to the roof of my mouth H2441; if I prefer H5927 (8686) not Jerusalem H3389 above my chief H7218 joy H8057.
137:007 Remember H2142 (8798), O LORD H3068, the children H1121 of Edom H0123 in the day H3117 of Jerusalem H3389; who said H0559 (8802), Rase H6168 (8761) [it], rase H6168 (8761) [it, even] to the foundation H3247 thereof.
137:008 O daughter H1323 of Babylon H0894, who art to be destroyed H7703 (8803); happy H0835 [shall he be], that rewardeth H7999 (8762) thee as thou hast served H1580 (8804) H1576 us.
137:009 Happy H0835 [shall he be], that taketh H0270 (8799) and dasheth H5310 (8765) thy little ones H5768 against the stones H5553.
138:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732.» I will praise H3034 (8686) thee with my whole heart H3820: before the gods H0430 will I sing praise H2167 (8762) unto thee.
138:002 I will worship H7812 (8691) toward thy holy H6944 temple H1964, and praise H3034 (8686) thy name H8034 for thy lovingkindness H2617 and for thy truth H0571: for thou hast magnified H1431 (8689) thy word H0565 above all thy name H8034.
138:003 In the day H3117 when I cried H7121 (8804) thou answeredst H6030 (8799) me, [and] strengthenedst H7292 (8686) me [with] strength H5797 in my soul H5315.
138:004 All the kings H4428 of the earth H0776 shall praise H3034 (8686) thee, O LORD H3068, when they hear H8085 (8804) the words H0561 of thy mouth H6310.
138:005 Yea, they shall sing H7891 (8799) in the ways H1870 of the LORD H3068: for great H1419 [is] the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068.
138:006 Though the LORD H3068 [be] high H7311 (8802), yet hath he respect H7200 (8799) unto the lowly H8217: but the proud H1364 he knoweth H3045 (8799) afar off H4801.
138:007 Though I walk H3212 (8799) in the midst H7130 of trouble H6869, thou wilt revive H2421 (8762) me: thou shalt stretch forth H7971 (8799) thine hand H3027 against the wrath H0639 of mine enemies H0341 (8802), and thy right hand H3225 shall save H3467 (8686) me.
138:008 The LORD H3068 will perfect H1584 (8799) [that which] concerneth me: thy mercy H2617, O LORD H3068, [endureth] for ever H5769: forsake H7503 (8686) not the works H4639 of thine own hands H3027.
139:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» O LORD H3068, thou hast searched H2713 (8804) me, and known H3045 (8799) [me].
139:002 Thou knowest H3045 (8804) my downsitting H3427 (8800) and mine uprising H6965 (8800), thou understandest H0995 (8804) my thought H7454 afar off H7350.
139:003 Thou compassest H2219 (8765) my path H0734 and my lying down H7252, and art acquainted H5532 (8689) [with] all my ways H1870.
139:004 For [there is] not a word H4405 in my tongue H3956, [but], lo, O LORD H3068, thou knowest H3045 (8804) it altogether.
139:005 Thou hast beset H6696 (8804) me behind H0268 and before H6924, and laid H7896 (8799) thine hand H3709 upon me.
139:006 [Such] knowledge H1847 [is] too wonderful H6383 (8675) H6383 for me; it is high H7682 (8738), I cannot H3201 (8799) [attain] unto it.
139:007 Whither shall I go H3212 (8799) from thy spirit H7307? or whither shall I flee H1272 (8799) from thy presence H6440?
139:008 If I ascend up H5266 (8799) into heaven H8064, thou [art] there: if I make my bed H3331 (8686) in hell H7585, behold, thou [art there].
139:009 [If] I take H5375 (8799) the wings H3671 of the morning H7837, [and] dwell H7931 (8799) in the uttermost parts H0319 of the sea H3220;
139:010 Even there shall thy hand H3027 lead H5148 (8686) me, and thy right hand H3225 shall hold H0270 (8799) me.
139:011 If I say H0559 (8799), Surely the darkness H2822 shall cover H7779 (8799) me; even the night H3915 shall be light H0216 about me H1157.
139:012 Yea, the darkness H2822 hideth H2821 (8686) not from thee; but the night H3915 shineth H0215 (8686) as the day H3117: the darkness H2825 and the light H0219 [are] both alike [to thee].
139:013 For thou hast possessed H7069 (8804) my reins H3629: thou hast covered H5526 (8799) me in my mother’s H0517 womb H0990.
139:014 I will praise H3034 (8686) thee; for I am fearfully H3372 (8737) [and] wonderfully made H6395 (8738): marvellous H6381 (8737) [are] thy works H4639; and [that] my soul H5315 knoweth H3045 (8802) right well H3966.
139:015 My substance H6108 was not hid H3582 (8738) from thee, when I was made H6213 (8795) in secret H5643, [and] curiously wrought H7551 (8795) in the lowest parts H8482 of the earth H0776.
139:016 Thine eyes H5869 did see H7200 (8804) my substance, yet being unperfect H1564; and in thy book H5612 all [my members] were written H3789 (8735), [which] in continuance H3117 were fashioned H3335 (8795), when [as yet there was] none H0259 of them.
139:017 How precious H3365 (8804) also are thy thoughts H7454 unto me, O God H0410! how great H6105 (8804) is the sum H7218 of them!
139:018 [If] I should count H5608 (8799) them, they are more in number H7235 (8799) than the sand H2344: when I awake H6974 (8689), I am still H5750 with thee.
139:019 Surely thou wilt slay H6991 (8799) the wicked H7563, O God H0433: depart H5493 (8798) from me therefore, ye bloody H1818 men H0582.
139:020 For they speak H0559 (8799) against thee wickedly H4209, [and] thine enemies H6145 take H5375 (8804) [thy name] in vain H7723.
139:021 Do not I hate H8130 (8799) them, O LORD H3068, that hate H8130 (8764) thee? and am not I grieved H6962 (8709) with those that rise up H8618 against thee?
139:022 I hate H8130 (8804) them with perfect H8503 hatred H8135: I count them mine enemies H0341 (8802).
139:023 Search H2713 (8798) me, O God H0410, and know H3045 (8798) my heart H3824: try H0974 (8798) me, and know H3045 (8798) my thoughts H8312:
139:024 And see H7200 (8798) if [there be any] wicked H6090 way H1870 in me, and lead H5148 (8798) me in the way H1870 everlasting H5769.
140:001 ¶  «To the chief Musician H5329 (8764), A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Deliver H2502 (8761) me, O LORD H3068, from the evil H7451 man H0120: preserve H5341 (8799) me from the violent H2555 man H0376;
140:002 Which imagine H2803 (8804) mischiefs H7451 in [their] heart H3820; continually H3117 are they gathered together H1481 (8799) [for] war H4421.
140:003 They have sharpened H8150 (8804) their tongues H3956 like a serpent H5175; adders H5919 ’ poison H2534 [is] under their lips H8193. Selah H5542.
140:004 Keep H8104 (8798) me, O LORD H3068, from the hands H3027 of the wicked H7563; preserve H5341 (8799) me from the violent H2555 man H0376; who have purposed H2803 (8804) to overthrow H1760 (8800) my goings H6471.
140:005 The proud H1343 have hid H2934 (8804) a snare H6341 for me, and cords H2256; they have spread H6566 (8804) a net H7568 by the wayside H3027 H4570; they have set H7896 (8804) gins H4170 for me. Selah H5542.
140:006 I said H0559 (8804) unto the LORD H3068, Thou [art] my God H0410: hear H0238 (8685) the voice H6963 of my supplications H8469, O LORD H3068.
140:007 O GOD H3069 the Lord H0136, the strength H5797 of my salvation H3444, thou hast covered H5526 (8804) my head H7218 in the day H3117 of battle H5402.
140:008 Grant H5414 (8799) not, O LORD H3068, the desires H3970 of the wicked H7563: further H6329 (8686) not his wicked device H2162; [lest] they exalt H7311 (8799) themselves. Selah H5542.
140:009 [As for] the head H7218 of those that compass me about H4524, let the mischief H5999 of their own lips H8193 cover H3680 (8762) them.
140:010 Let burning coals H1513 fall H4131 (8735) (8675) H4131 (8686) upon them: let them be cast H5307 (8686) into the fire H0784; into deep pits H4113, that they rise not up again H6965 (8799).
140:011 Let not an evil speaker H0376 H3956 be established H3559 (8735) in the earth H0776: evil H7451 shall hunt H6679 (8799) the violent H2555 man H0376 to overthrow H4073 [him].
140:012 I know H3045 (8804) that the LORD H3068 will maintain H6213 (8799) the cause H1779 of the afflicted H6041, [and] the right H4941 of the poor H0034.
140:013 Surely the righteous H6662 shall give thanks H3034 (8686) unto thy name H8034: the upright H3477 shall dwell H3427 (8799) in thy presence H6440.
141:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» LORD H3068, I cry H7121 (8804) unto thee: make haste H2363 (8798) unto me; give ear H0238 (8685) unto my voice H6963, when I cry H7121 (8800) unto thee.
141:002 Let my prayer H8605 be set forth H3559 (8735) before H6440 thee [as] incense H7004; [and] the lifting up H4864 of my hands H3709 [as] the evening H6153 sacrifice H4503.
141:003 Set H7896 (8798) a watch H8108, O LORD H3068, before my mouth H6310; keep H5341 (8798) the door H1817 of my lips H8193.
141:004 Incline H5186 (8686) not my heart H3820 to [any] evil H7451 thing H1697, to practise H5953 (8705) wicked H7562 works H5949 with men H0376 that work H6466 (8802) iniquity H0205: and let me not eat H3898 (8799) of their dainties H4516.
141:005 Let the righteous H6662 smite H1986 (8799) me; [it shall be] a kindness H2617: and let him reprove H3198 (8686) me; [it shall be] an excellent H7218 oil H8081, [which] shall not break H5106 (8686) my head H7218: for yet my prayer H8605 also [shall be] in their calamities H7451.
141:006 When their judges H8199 (8802) are overthrown H8058 (8738) in stony H5553 places H3027, they shall hear H8085 (8804) my words H0561; for they are sweet H5276 (8804).
141:007 Our bones H6106 are scattered H6340 (8738) at the grave’s H7585 mouth H6310, as when one cutteth H6398 (8802) and cleaveth H1234 (8802) [wood] upon the earth H0776.
141:008 But mine eyes H5869 [are] unto thee, O GOD H3069 the Lord H0136: in thee is my trust H2620 (8804); leave H6168 not my soul H5315 destitute H6168 (8762).
141:009 Keep H8104 (8798) me from the snares H3027 H6341 [which] they have laid H3369 (8804) for me, and the gins H4170 of the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205.
141:010 Let the wicked H7563 fall H5307 (8799) into their own nets H4364, whilst that I withal H3162 escape H5674 (8799).
142:001 ¶  «Maschil H4905 (8688) of David H1732; A Prayer H8605 when he was in the cave H4631.» I cried H2199 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 with my voice H6963; with my voice H6963 unto the LORD H3068 did I make my supplication H2603 (8691).
142:002 I poured out H8210 (8799) my complaint H7879 before H6440 him; I shewed H5046 (8686) before H6440 him my trouble H6869.
142:003 When my spirit H7307 was overwhelmed H5848 (8692) within me, then thou knewest H3045 (8804) my path H5410. In the way H0734 wherein H2098 I walked H1980 (8762) have they privily laid H2934 (8804) a snare H6341 for me.
142:004 I looked H5027 (8685) on [my] right hand H3225, and beheld H7200 (8798), but [there was] no man that would know H5234 (8688) me: refuge H4498 failed H0006 (8804) me; no man cared H1875 (8802) for my soul H5315.
142:005 I cried H2199 (8804) unto thee, O LORD H3068: I said H0559 (8804), Thou [art] my refuge H4268 [and] my portion H2506 in the land H0776 of the living H2416.
142:006 Attend H7181 (8685) unto my cry H7440; for I am brought H1809 very H3966 low H1809 (8804): deliver H5337 (8685) me from my persecutors H7291 (8802); for they are stronger H0553 (8804) than I.
142:007 Bring H3318 (8685) my soul H5315 out of prison H4525, that I may praise H3034 (8687) thy name H8034: the righteous H6662 shall compass me about H3803 (8686); for thou shalt deal bountifully H1580 (8799) with me.
143:001 ¶  «A Psalm H4210 of David H1732.» Hear H8085 (8798) my prayer H8605, O LORD H3068, give ear H0238 (8685) to my supplications H8469: in thy faithfulness H0530 answer H6030 (8798) me, [and] in thy righteousness H6666.
143:002 And enter H0935 (8799) not into judgment H4941 with thy servant H5650: for in thy sight H6440 shall no man living H2416 be justified H6663 (8799).
143:003 For the enemy H0341 (8802) hath persecuted H7291 (8804) my soul H5315; he hath smitten H1792 my life H2416 down H1792 (8765) to the ground H0776; he hath made me to dwell H3427 (8689) in darkness H4285, as those that have been long H5769 dead H4191 (8801).
143:004 Therefore is my spirit H7307 overwhelmed H5848 (8691) within me; my heart H3820 within H8432 me is desolate H8074 (8709).
143:005 I remember H2142 (8804) the days H3117 of old H6924; I meditate H1897 (8804) on all thy works H6467; I muse H7878 (8787) on the work H4639 of thy hands H3027.
143:006 I stretch forth H6566 (8765) my hands H3027 unto thee: my soul H5315 [thirsteth] after thee, as a thirsty H5889 land H0776. Selah H5542.
143:007 Hear H6030 (8798) me speedily H4118, O LORD H3068: my spirit H7307 faileth H3615 (8804): hide H5641 (8686) not thy face H6440 from me, lest I be like H4911 (8738) unto them that go down H3381 (8802) into the pit H0953.
143:008 Cause me to hear H8085 (8685) thy lovingkindness H2617 in the morning H1242; for in thee do I trust H0982 (8804): cause me to know H3045 (8685) the way H1870 wherein H2098 I should walk H3212 (8799); for I lift up H5375 (8804) my soul H5315 unto thee.
143:009 Deliver H5337 (8685) me, O LORD H3068, from mine enemies H0341 (8802): I flee unto thee to hide H3680 (8765) me.
143:010 Teach H3925 (8761) me to do H6213 (8800) thy will H7522; for thou [art] my God H0430: thy spirit H7307 [is] good H2896; lead H5148 (8686) me into the land H0776 of uprightness H4334.
143:011 Quicken H2421 (8762) me, O LORD H3068, for thy name’s H8034 sake: for thy righteousness H6666 ’ sake bring H3318 (8686) my soul H5315 out of trouble H6869.
143:012 And of thy mercy H2617 cut off H6789 (8686) mine enemies H0341 (8802), and destroy H0006 (8689) all them that afflict H6887 (8802) my soul H5315: for I [am] thy servant H5650.
144:001 ¶  «[A Psalm] of David H1732.» Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 my strength H6697, which teacheth H3925 (8764) my hands H3027 to war H7128, [and] my fingers H0676 to fight H4421:
144:002 My goodness H2617, and my fortress H4686; my high tower H4869, and my deliverer H6403 (8764); my shield H4043, and [he] in whom I trust H2620 (8804); who subdueth H7286 (8802) my people H5971 under me.
144:003 LORD H3068, what [is] man H0120, that thou takest knowledge H3045 (8799) of him! [or] the son H1121 of man H0582, that thou makest account H2803 (8762) of him!
144:004 Man H0120 is like H1819 (8804) to vanity H1892: his days H3117 [are] as a shadow H6738 that passeth away H5674 (8802).
144:005 Bow H5186 (8685) thy heavens H8064, O LORD H3068, and come down H3381 (8799): touch H5060 (8798) the mountains H2022, and they shall smoke H6225 (8799).
144:006 Cast forth H1299 (8798) lightning H1300, and scatter H6327 (8686) them: shoot out H7971 (8798) thine arrows H2671, and destroy H2000 (8799) them.
144:007 Send H7971 (8798) thine hand H3027 from above H4791; rid H6475 (8798) me, and deliver H5337 (8685) me out of great H7227 waters H4325, from the hand H3027 of strange H5236 children H1121;
144:008 Whose mouth H6310 speaketh H1696 (8765) vanity H7723, and their right hand H3225 [is] a right hand H3225 of falsehood H8267.
144:009 I will sing H7891 (8799) a new H2319 song H7892 unto thee, O God H0430: upon a psaltery H5035 [and] an instrument of ten strings H6218 will I sing praises H2167 (8762) unto thee.
144:010 [It is he] that giveth H5414 (8802) salvation H8668 unto kings H4428: who delivereth H6475 (8802) David H1732 his servant H5650 from the hurtful H7451 sword H2719.
144:011 Rid H6475 (8798) me, and deliver H5337 (8685) me from the hand H3027 of strange H5236 children H1121, whose mouth H6310 speaketh H1696 (8765) vanity H7723, and their right hand H3225 [is] a right hand H3225 of falsehood H8267:
144:012 That our sons H1121 [may be] as plants H5195 grown up H1431 (8794) in their youth H5271; [that] our daughters H1323 [may be] as corner stones H2106, polished H2404 (8794) [after] the similitude H8403 of a palace H1964:
144:013 [That] our garners H4200 [may be] full H4392, affording H6329 (8688) all manner of store H2177 H2177: [that] our sheep H6629 may bring forth thousands H0503 (8688) and ten thousands H7231 (8794) in our streets H2351:
144:014 [That] our oxen H0441 [may be] strong to labour H5445 (8794); [that there be] no breaking in H6556, nor going out H3318 (8802); that [there be] no complaining H6682 in our streets H7339.
144:015 Happy H0835 [is that] people H5971, that is in such a case H3602: [yea], happy H0835 [is that] people H5971, whose God H0430 [is] the LORD H3068.
145:001 ¶  «David’s H1732 [Psalm] of praise H8416.» I will extol H7311 (8787) thee, my God H0430, O king H4428; and I will bless H1288 (8762) thy name H8034 for ever H5769 and ever H5703.
145:002 Every day H3117 will I bless H1288 (8762) thee; and I will praise H1984 (8762) thy name H8034 for ever H5769 and ever H5703.
145:003 Great H1419 [is] the LORD H3068, and greatly H3966 to be praised H1984 (8794); and his greatness H1420 [is] unsearchable H2714.
145:004 One H1755 generation H1755 shall praise H7623 (8762) thy works H4639 to another, and shall declare H5046 (8686) thy mighty acts H1369.
145:005 I will speak H7878 (8799) of the glorious H3519 honour H1926 of thy majesty H1935, and of thy wondrous H6381 (8737) works H1697.
145:006 And [men] shall speak H0559 (8799) of the might H5807 of thy terrible acts H3372 (8737): and I will declare H5608 (8762) thy greatness H1420.
145:007 They shall abundantly utter H5042 (8686) the memory H2143 of thy great H7227 goodness H2898, and shall sing H7442 (8762) of thy righteousness H6666.
145:008 The LORD H3068 [is] gracious H2587, and full of compassion H7349; slow H0750 to anger H0639, and of great H1419 mercy H2617.
145:009 The LORD H3068 [is] good H2896 to all: and his tender mercies H7356 [are] over all his works H4639.
145:010 All thy works H4639 shall praise H3034 (8686) thee, O LORD H3068; and thy saints H2623 shall bless H1288 (8762) thee.
145:011 They shall speak H0559 (8799) of the glory H3519 of thy kingdom H4438, and talk H1696 (8762) of thy power H1369;
145:012 To make known H3045 (8687) to the sons H1121 of men H0120 his mighty acts H1369, and the glorious H3519 majesty H1926 of his kingdom H4438.
145:013 Thy kingdom H4438 [is] an everlasting H5769 kingdom H4438, and thy dominion H4475 [endureth] throughout all H1755 generations H1755.
145:014 The LORD H3068 upholdeth H5564 (8802) all that fall H5307 (8802), and raiseth up H2210 (8802) all [those that be] bowed down H3721 (8803).
145:015 The eyes H5869 of all wait H7663 (8762) upon thee; and thou givest H5414 (8802) them their meat H0400 in due season H6256.
145:016 Thou openest H6605 (8802) thine hand H3027, and satisfiest H7646 (8688) the desire H7522 of every living thing H2416.
145:017 The LORD H3068 [is] righteous H6662 in all his ways H1870, and holy H2623 in all his works H4639.
145:018 The LORD H3068 [is] nigh H7138 unto all them that call H7121 (8802) upon him, to all that call H7121 (8799) upon him in truth H0571.
145:019 He will fulfil H6213 (8799) the desire H7522 of them that fear H3373 him: he also will hear H8085 (8799) their cry H7775, and will save H3467 (8686) them.
145:020 The LORD H3068 preserveth H8104 (8802) all them that love H0157 (8802) him: but all the wicked H7563 will he destroy H8045 (8686).
145:021 My mouth H6310 shall speak H1696 (8762) the praise H8416 of the LORD H3068: and let all flesh H1320 bless H1288 (8762) his holy H6944 name H8034 for ever H5769 and ever H5703.
146:001 ¶  Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050. Praise H1984 (8761) the LORD H3068, O my soul H5315.
146:002 While I live H2416 will I praise H1984 (8762) the LORD H3068: I will sing praises H2167 (8762) unto my God H0430 while I have any being.
146:003 Put not your trust H0982 (8799) in princes H5081, [nor] in the son H1121 of man H0120, in whom [there is] no help H8668.
146:004 His breath H7307 goeth forth H3318 (8799), he returneth H7725 (8799) to his earth H0127; in that very day H3117 his thoughts H6250 perish H0006 (8804).
146:005 Happy H0835 [is he] that [hath] the God H0410 of Jacob H3290 for his help H5828, whose hope H7664 [is] in the LORD H3068 his God H0430:
146:006 Which made H6213 (8802) heaven H8064, and earth H0776, the sea H3220, and all that therein [is]: which keepeth H8104 (8802) truth H0571 for ever H5769:
146:007 Which executeth H6213 (8802) judgment H4941 for the oppressed H6231 (8803): which giveth H5414 (8802) food H3899 to the hungry H7457. The LORD H3068 looseth H5425 (8688) the prisoners H0631 (8803):
146:008 The LORD H3068 openeth H6491 (8802) [the eyes of] the blind H5787: the LORD H3068 raiseth H2210 (8802) them that are bowed down H3721 (8803): the LORD H3068 loveth H0157 (8802) the righteous H6662:
146:009 The LORD H3068 preserveth H8104 (8802) the strangers H1616; he relieveth H5749 (8766) the fatherless H3490 and widow H0490: but the way H1870 of the wicked H7563 he turneth upside down H5791 (8762).
146:010 The LORD H3068 shall reign H4427 (8799) for ever H5769, [even] thy God H0430, O Zion H6726, unto all H1755 generations H1755. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.
147:001 ¶  Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050: for [it is] good H2896 to sing praises H2167 (8763) unto our God H0430; for [it is] pleasant H5273; [and] praise H8416 is comely H5000.
147:002 The LORD H3068 doth build up H1129 (8802) Jerusalem H3389: he gathereth together H3664 (8762) the outcasts H1760 (8737) of Israel H3478.
147:003 He healeth H7495 (8802) the broken H7665 (8803) in heart H3820, and bindeth up H2280 (8764) their wounds H6094.
147:004 He telleth H4487 (8802) the number H4557 of the stars H3556; he calleth H7121 (8799) them all by [their] names H8034.
147:005 Great H1419 [is] our Lord H0113, and of great H7227 power H3581: his understanding H8394 [is] infinite H4557.
147:006 The LORD H3068 lifteth up H5749 (8767) the meek H6035: he casteth H8213 the wicked H7563 down H8213 (8688) to the ground H0776.
147:007 Sing H6030 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 with thanksgiving H8426; sing praise H2167 (8761) upon the harp H3658 unto our God H0430:
147:008 Who covereth H3680 (8764) the heaven H8064 with clouds H5645, who prepareth H3559 (8688) rain H4306 for the earth H0776, who maketh grass H2682 to grow H6779 (8688) upon the mountains H2022.
147:009 He giveth H5414 (8802) to the beast H0929 his food H3899, [and] to the young H1121 ravens H6158 which cry H7121 (8799).
147:010 He delighteth H2654 (8799) not in the strength H1369 of the horse H5483: he taketh not pleasure H7521 (8799) in the legs H7785 of a man H0376.
147:011 The LORD H3068 taketh pleasure H7521 (8802) in them that fear H3373 him, in those that hope H3176 (8764) in his mercy H2617.
147:012 Praise H7623 (8761) the LORD H3068, O Jerusalem H3389; praise H1984 (8761) thy God H0430, O Zion H6726.
147:013 For he hath strengthened H2388 (8765) the bars H1280 of thy gates H8179; he hath blessed H1288 (8765) thy children H1121 within H7130 thee.
147:014 He maketh H7760 (8802) peace H7965 [in] thy borders H1366, [and] filleth H7646 (8686) thee with the finest H2459 of the wheat H2406.
147:015 He sendeth forth H7971 (8802) his commandment H0565 [upon] earth H0776: his word H1697 runneth H7323 (8799) very swiftly H4120.
147:016 He giveth H5414 (8802) snow H7950 like wool H6785: he scattereth H6340 (8762) the hoarfrost H3713 like ashes H0665.
147:017 He casteth forth H7993 (8688) his ice H7140 like morsels H6595: who can stand H5975 (8799) before H6440 his cold H7135?
147:018 He sendeth out H7971 (8799) his word H1697, and melteth H4529 (8686) them: he causeth his wind H7307 to blow H5380 (8686), [and] the waters H4325 flow H5140 (8799).
147:019 He sheweth H5046 (8688) his word H1697 (8675) H1697 unto Jacob H3290, his statutes H2706 and his judgments H4941 unto Israel H3478.
147:020 He hath not dealt H6213 (8804) so with any nation H1471: and [as for his] judgments H4941, they have not known H3045 (8804) them. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.

148:006 He hath also stablished H5975 (8686) them for ever H5703 and ever H5769: he hath made H5414 (8804) a decree H2706 which shall not pass H5674 (8799).
148:007 Praise H1984 (8761) the LORD H3068 from the earth H0776, ye dragons H8577, and all deeps H8415:
148:008 Fire H0784, and hail H1259; snow H7950, and vapour H7008; stormy H5591 wind H7307 fulfilling H6213 (8802) his word H1697:
148:009 Mountains H2022, and all hills H1389; fruitful H6529 trees H6086, and all cedars H0730:
148:010 Beasts H2416, and all cattle H0929; creeping things H7431, and flying H3671 fowl H6833:
148:011 Kings H4428 of the earth H0776, and all people H3816; princes H8269, and all judges H8199 (8802) of the earth H0776:
148:012 Both young men H0970, and maidens H1330; old men H2205, and children H5288:
148:013 Let them praise H1984 (8762) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068: for his name H8034 alone is excellent H7682 (8737); his glory H1935 [is] above the earth H0776 and heaven H8064.
148:014 He also exalteth H7311 (8686) the horn H7161 of his people H5971, the praise H8416 of all his saints H2623; [even] of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, a people H5971 near H7138 unto him. Praise H1984 (8761) ye the LORD H3050.

149:004 For the LORD H3068 taketh pleasure H7521 (8802) in his people H5971: he will beautify H6286 (8762) the meek H6035 with salvation H3444.
149:005 Let the saints H2623 be joyful H5937 (8799) in glory H3519: let them sing aloud H7442 (8762) upon their beds H4904.
149:006 [Let] the high H7319 [praises] of God H0410 [be] in their mouth H1627, and a twoedged H6374 sword H2719 in their hand H3027;
149:007 To execute H6213 (8800) vengeance H5360 upon the heathen H1471, [and] punishments H8433 upon the people H3816;
