001:001 ¶  There was a man H0376 in the land H0776 of Uz H5780, whose name H8034 [was] Job H0347; and that man H0376 was perfect H8535 and upright H3477, and one that feared H3373 God H0430, and eschewed H5493 (8802) evil H7451.
001:002 And there were born H3205 (8735) unto him seven H7651 sons H1121 and three H7969 daughters H1323.
001:003 His substance H4735 also was seven H7651 thousand H0505 sheep H6629, and three H7969 thousand H0505 camels H1581, and five H2568 hundred H3967 yoke H6776 of oxen H1241, and five H2568 hundred H3967 she asses H0860, and a very H3966 great H7227 household H5657; so that this man H0376 was the greatest H1419 of all the men H1121 of the east H6924.
001:004 And his sons H1121 went H1980 (8804) and feasted H4960 H6213 (8804) [in their] houses H1004, every one H0376 his day H3117; and sent H7971 (8804) and called H7121 (8804) for their three H7969 sisters H0269 to eat H0398 (8800) and to drink H8354 (8800) with them.
001:005 And it was so, when the days H3117 of [their] feasting H4960 were gone about H5362 (8689), that Job H0347 sent H7971 (8799) and sanctified H6942 (8762) them, and rose up early H7925 (8689) in the morning H1242, and offered H5927 (8689) burnt offerings H5930 [according] to the number H4557 of them all: for Job H0347 said H0559 (8804), It may be H0194 that my sons H1121 have sinned H2398 (8804), and cursed H1288 (8765) God H0430 in their hearts H3824. Thus did H6213 (8799) Job H0347 continually H3117.
001:006 Now there was a day H3117 when the sons H1121 of God H0430 came H0935 (8799) to present H3320 (8692) themselves before the LORD H3068, and Satan H7854 came H0935 (8799) also among H8432 them.
001:007 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Satan H7854, Whence H0370 comest H0935 (8799) thou? Then Satan H7854 answered H6030 (8799) the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), From going to and fro H7751 (8800) in the earth H0776, and from walking up and down H1980 (8692) in it.
001:008 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Satan H7854, Hast thou considered H7760 (8804) H3820 my servant H5650 Job H0347, that [there is] none like him in the earth H0776, a perfect H8535 and an upright H3477 man H0376, one that feareth H3373 God H0430, and escheweth H5493 (8802) evil H7451?
001:009 Then Satan H7854 answered H6030 (8799) the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), Doth Job H0347 fear H3372 (8804) God H0430 for nought H2600?
001:010 Hast not thou made an hedge H7753 (8804) about him, and about H1157 his house H1004, and about all that he hath on every side H5439? thou hast blessed H1288 (8765) the work H4639 of his hands H3027, and his substance H4735 is increased H6555 (8804) in the land H0776.
001:011 But H0199 put forth H7971 (8798) thine hand H3027 now, and touch H5060 (8798) all that he hath, and he will curse H1288 (8762) H3808 thee to thy face H6440.
001:012 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Satan H7854, Behold, all that he hath [is] in thy power H3027; only upon himself put not forth H7971 (8799) thine hand H3027. So Satan H7854 went forth H3318 (8799) from the presence H6440 of the LORD H3068.
001:013 And there was a day H3117 when his sons H1121 and his daughters H1323 [were] eating H0398 (8802) and drinking H8354 (8802) wine H3196 in their eldest H1060 brother’s H0251 house H1004:
001:014 And there came H0935 (8804) a messenger H4397 unto Job H0347, and said H0559 (8799), The oxen H1241 were plowing H2790 (8802), and the asses H0860 feeding H7462 (8802) beside H3027 them:
001:015 And the Sabeans H7614 fell H5307 (8799) [upon them], and took them away H3947 (8799); yea, they have slain H5221 (8689) the servants H5288 with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719; and I only am escaped H4422 (8735) alone to tell H5046 (8687) thee.
001:016 While he [was] yet speaking H1696 (8764), there came H0935 (8802) also another, and said H0559 (8799), The fire H0784 of God H0430 is fallen H5307 (8804) from heaven H8064, and hath burned up H1197 (8799) the sheep H6629, and the servants H5288, and consumed H0398 (8799) them; and I only am escaped H4422 (8735) alone to tell H5046 (8687) thee.
001:017 While he [was] yet speaking H1696 (8764), there came H0935 (8802) also another, and said H0559 (8799), The Chaldeans H3778 made out H7760 (8804) three H7969 bands H7218, and fell H6584 (8799) upon the camels H1581, and have carried them away H3947 (8799), yea, and slain H5221 (8689) the servants H5288 with the edge H6310 of the sword H2719; and I only am escaped H4422 (8735) alone to tell H5046 (8687) thee.
001:018 While he [was] yet speaking H1696 (8764), there came H0935 (8802) also another, and said H0559 (8799), Thy sons H1121 and thy daughters H1323 [were] eating H0398 (8802) and drinking H8354 (8802) wine H3196 in their eldest H1060 brother’s H0251 house H1004:
001:019 And, behold, there came H0935 (8804) a great H1419 wind H7307 from H5676 the wilderness H4057, and smote H5060 (8799) the four H0702 corners H6438 of the house H1004, and it fell H5307 (8799) upon the young men H5288, and they are dead H4191 (8799); and I only am escaped H4422 (8735) alone to tell H5046 (8687) thee.
001:020 Then Job H0347 arose H6965 (8799), and rent H7167 (8799) his mantle H4598, and shaved H1494 (8799) his head H7218, and fell down H5307 (8799) upon the ground H0776, and worshipped H7812 (8691),
001:021 And said H0559 (8799), Naked H6174 came I out H3318 (8804) of my mother’s H0517 womb H0990, and naked H6174 shall I return H7725 (8799) thither: the LORD H3068 gave H5414 (8804), and the LORD H3068 hath taken away H3947 (8804); blessed H1288 (8794) be the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
001:022 In all this Job H0347 sinned H2398 (8804) not, nor charged H5414 (8804) God H0430 foolishly H8604.
002:001 ¶  Again there was a day H3117 when the sons H1121 of God H0430 came H0935 (8799) to present H3320 (8692) themselves before the LORD H3068, and Satan H7854 came H0935 (8799) also among H8432 them to present H3320 (8692) himself before the LORD H3068.
002:002 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Satan H7854, From whence H0335 comest H0935 (8799) thou? And Satan H7854 answered H6030 (8799) the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), From going to and fro H7751 (8800) in the earth H0776, and from walking up and down H1980 (8692) in it.
002:003 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Satan H7854, Hast thou H7760 (8804) considered H3820 my servant H5650 Job H0347, that [there is] none like him in the earth H0776, a perfect H8535 and an upright H3477 man H0376, one that feareth H3373 God H0430, and escheweth H5493 (8802) evil H7451? and still he holdeth fast H2388 (8688) his integrity H8538, although thou movedst H5496 (8686) me against him, to destroy H1104 (8763) him without cause H2600.
002:004 And Satan H7854 answered H6030 (8799) the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), Skin H5785 for skin H5785, yea, all that a man H0376 hath will he give H5414 (8799) for his life H5315.
002:005 But H0199 put forth H7971 (8798) thine hand H3027 now, and touch H5060 (8798) his bone H6106 and his flesh H1320, and he will curse H1288 (8762) thee to thy face H6440.
002:006 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto Satan H7854, Behold, he [is] in thine hand H3027; but save H8104 (8798) his life H5315.
002:007 So went H3318 Satan H7854 forth H3318 (8799) from the presence H6440 of the LORD H3068, and smote H5221 (8686) Job H0347 with sore H7451 boils H7822 from the sole H3709 of his foot H7272 unto his crown H6936.
002:008 And he took H3947 (8799) him a potsherd H2789 to scrape H1623 (8692) himself withal; and he sat down H3427 (8802) among H8432 the ashes H0665.
002:009 Then said H0559 (8799) his wife H0802 unto him, Dost thou still retain H2388 (8688) thine integrity H8538? curse H1288 (8761) God H0430, and die H4191 (8798).
002:010 But he said H0559 (8799) unto her, Thou speakest H1696 (8762) as one H0259 of the foolish women H5036 speaketh H1696 (8763). What H1571? shall we receive H6901 (8762) good H2896 at the hand of God H0430, and shall we not receive H6901 (8762) evil H7451? In all this did not Job H0347 sin H2398 (8804) with his lips H8193.
002:011 Now when Job’s H0347 three H7969 friends H7453 heard H8085 (8799) of all this evil H7451 that was come H0935 (8802) upon him, they came H0935 (8799) every one H0376 from his own place H4725; Eliphaz H0464 the Temanite H8489, and Bildad H1085 the Shuhite H7747, and Zophar H6691 the Naamathite H5284: for they had made an appointment H3259 (8735) together H3162 to come H0935 (8800) to mourn H5110 (8800) with him and to comfort H5162 (8763) him.
002:012 And when they lifted up H5375 (8799) their eyes H5869 afar off H7350, and knew H5234 (8689) him not, they lifted up H5375 (8799) their voice H6963, and wept H1058 (8799); and they rent H7167 (8799) every one H0376 his mantle H4598, and sprinkled H2236 (8799) dust H6083 upon their heads H7218 toward heaven H8064.
002:013 So they sat down H3427 (8799) with him upon the ground H0776 seven H7651 days H3117 and seven H7651 nights H3915, and none spake H1696 (8802) a word H1697 unto him: for they saw H7200 (8804) that [his] grief H3511 was very H3966 great H1431 (8804).
003:001 ¶  After H0310 this opened H6605 (8804) Job H0347 his mouth H6310, and cursed H7043 (8762) his day H3117.
003:002 And Job H0347 spake H6030 (8799), and said H0559 (8799),
003:003 Let the day H3117 perish H0006 (8799) wherein I was born H3205 (8735), and the night H3915 [in which] it was said H0559 (8804), There is a man child H1397 conceived H2029 (8795).
003:004 Let that day H3117 be darkness H2822; let not God H0433 regard H1875 (8799) it from above H4605, neither let the light H5105 shine H3313 (8686) upon it.
003:005 Let darkness H2822 and the shadow of death H6757 stain H1350 (8799) it; let a cloud H6053 dwell H7931 (8799) upon it; let the blackness H3650 of the day H3117 terrify H1204 (8762) it.
003:006 As [for] that night H3915, let darkness H0652 seize H3947 (8799) upon it; let it not be joined H2302 (8799) unto the days H3117 of the year H8141, let it not come H0935 (8799) into the number H4557 of the months H3391.
003:007 Lo, let that night H3915 be solitary H1565, let no joyful voice H7445 come H0935 (8799) therein.
003:008 Let them curse H5344 (8799) it that curse H0779 (8802) the day H3117, who are ready H6264 to raise up H5782 (8788) their mourning H3882.
003:009 Let the stars H3556 of the twilight H5399 thereof be dark H2821 (8799); let it look H6960 (8762) for light H0216, but [have] none; neither let it see H7200 (8799) the dawning H6079 of the day H7837:
003:010 Because it shut not up H5462 (8804) the doors H1817 of my [mother’s] womb H0990, nor hid H5641 (8686) sorrow H5999 from mine eyes H5869.
003:011 Why died H4191 (8799) I not from the womb H7358? [why] did I [not] give up the ghost H1478 (8799) when I came out H3318 (8804) of the belly H0990?
003:012 Why did the knees H1290 prevent H6923 (8765) me? or why the breasts H7699 that I should suck H3243 (8799)?
003:013 For now should I have lain still H7901 (8804) and been quiet H8252 (8799), I should have slept H3462 (8804): then had I been at rest H5117 (8799),
003:014 With kings H4428 and counsellors H3289 (8802) of the earth H0776, which built H1129 (8802) desolate places H2723 for themselves;
003:015 Or with princes H8269 that had gold H2091, who filled H4390 (8764) their houses H1004 with silver H3701:
003:016 Or as an hidden H2934 (8803) untimely birth H5309 I had not been; as infants H5768 [which] never saw H7200 (8804) light H0216.
003:017 There the wicked H7563 cease H2308 (8804) [from] troubling H7267; and there the weary H3019 H3581 be at rest H5117 (8799).
003:018 [There] the prisoners H0615 rest H7599 (8768) together H3162; they hear H8085 (8804) not the voice H6963 of the oppressor H5065 (8802).
003:019 The small H6996 and great H1419 are there; and the servant H5650 [is] free H2670 from his master H0113.
003:020 Wherefore is light H0216 given H5414 (8799) to him that is in misery H6001, and life H2416 unto the bitter H4751 [in] soul H5315;
003:021 Which long H2442 (8764) for death H4194, but it [cometh] not; and dig H2658 (8799) for it more than for hid treasures H4301;
003:022 Which rejoice H8056 exceedingly H1524, [and] are glad H7797 (8799), when they can find H4672 (8799) the grave H6913?
003:023 [Why is light given] to a man H1397 whose way H1870 is hid H5641 (8738), and whom God H0433 hath hedged in H5526 (8686)?
003:024 For my sighing H0585 cometh H0935 (8799) before H6440 I eat H3899, and my roarings H7581 are poured out H5413 (8799) like the waters H4325.
003:025 For the thing which I greatly H6343 feared H6342 (8804) is come H0857 (8799) upon me, and that which I was afraid H3025 (8804) of is come H0935 (8799) unto me.
003:026 I was not in safety H7951 (8804), neither had I rest H8252 (8804), neither was I quiet H5117 (8804); yet trouble H7267 came H0935 (8799).
004:001 ¶  Then Eliphaz H0464 the Temanite H8489 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
004:002 [If] we assay H5254 (8765) to commune H1697 with thee, wilt thou be grieved H3811 (8799)? but who can H3201 (8799) withhold H6113 (8800) himself from speaking H4405?
004:003 Behold, thou hast instructed H3256 (8765) many H7227, and thou hast strengthened H2388 (8762) the weak H7504 hands H3027.
004:004 Thy words H4405 have upholden H6965 (8686) him that was falling H3782 (8802), and thou hast strengthened H0553 (8762) the feeble H3766 (8802) knees H1290.
004:005 But now it is come H0935 (8799) upon thee, and thou faintest H3811 (8799); it toucheth H5060 (8799) thee, and thou art troubled H0926 (8735).
004:006 [Is] not [this] thy fear H3374, thy confidence H3690, thy hope H8615, and the uprightness H8537 of thy ways H1870?
004:007 Remember H2142 (8798), I pray thee, who [ever] perished H0006 (8804), being innocent H5355? or where H0375 were the righteous H3477 cut off H3582 (8738)?
004:008 Even as I have seen H7200 (8804), they that plow H2790 (8802) iniquity H0205, and sow H2232 (8802) wickedness H5999, reap H7114 (8799) the same.
004:009 By the blast H5397 of God H0433 they perish H0006 (8799), and by the breath H7307 of his nostrils H0639 are they consumed H3615 (8799).
004:010 The roaring H7581 of the lion H0738, and the voice H6963 of the fierce lion H7826, and the teeth H8127 of the young lions H3715, are broken H5421 (8738).
004:011 The old lion H3918 perisheth H0006 (8802) for lack H1097 of prey H2964, and the stout lion’s H3833 whelps H1121 are scattered abroad H6504 (8691).
004:012 Now a thing H1697 was secretly brought H1589 (8792) to me, and mine ear H0241 received H3947 (8799) a little H8102 thereof.
004:013 In thoughts H5587 from the visions H2384 of the night H3915, when deep sleep H8639 falleth H5307 (8800) on men H0582,
004:014 Fear H6343 came H7122 (8804) upon me, and trembling H7461, which made all H7230 my bones H6106 to shake H6342 (8689).
004:015 Then a spirit H7307 passed H2498 (8799) before my face H6440; the hair H8185 of my flesh H1320 stood up H5568 (8762):
004:016 It stood still H5975 (8799), but I could not discern H5234 (8686) the form H4758 thereof: an image H8544 [was] before mine eyes H5869, [there was] silence H1827, and I heard H8085 (8799) a voice H6963, [saying],
004:017 Shall mortal man H0582 be more just H6663 (8799) than God H0433? shall a man H1397 be more pure H2891 (8799) than his maker H6213 (8802)?
004:018 Behold, he put no trust H0539 (8686) in his servants H5650; and his angels H4397 he charged H7760 (8799) with folly H8417:
004:019 How much less H0637 [in] them that dwell H7931 (8802) in houses H1004 of clay H2563, whose foundation H3247 [is] in the dust H6083, [which] are crushed H1792 (8762) before H6440 the moth H6211?
004:020 They are destroyed H3807 (8714) from morning H1242 to evening H6153: they perish H0006 (8799) for ever H5331 without any regarding H7760 (8688) [it].
004:021 Doth not their excellency H3499 [which is] in them go away H5265 (8738)? they die H4191 (8799), even without wisdom H2451.
005:001 ¶  Call H7121 (8798) now, if there be H3426 any that will answer H6030 (8802) thee; and to which of the saints H6918 wilt thou turn H6437 (8799)?
005:002 For wrath H3708 killeth H2026 (8799) the foolish man H0191, and envy H7068 slayeth H4191 (8686) the silly one H6601 (8802).
005:003 I have seen H7200 (8804) the foolish H0191 taking root H8327 (8688): but suddenly H6597 I cursed H5344 (8799) his habitation H5116.
005:004 His children H1121 are far H7368 (8799) from safety H3468, and they are crushed H1792 (8691) in the gate H8179, neither [is there] any to deliver H5337 (8688) [them].
005:005 Whose harvest H7105 the hungry H7457 eateth up H0398 (8799), and taketh H3947 (8799) it even out H0413 of the thorns H6791, and the robber H6782 swalloweth up H7602 (8804) their substance H2428.
005:006 Although affliction H0205 cometh not forth H3318 (8799) of the dust H6083, neither doth trouble H5999 spring out H6779 (8799) of the ground H0127;
005:007 Yet man H0120 is born H3205 (8795) unto trouble H5999, as the sparks H1121 H7565 fly H5774 (8800) upward H1361 (8686).
005:008 I would seek H0199 H1875 (8799) unto God H0410, and unto God H0430 would I commit H7760 (8799) my cause H1700:
005:009 Which doeth H6213 (8802) great things H1419 and unsearchable H0369 H2714; marvellous things H6381 (8737) without number H4557:
005:010 Who giveth H5414 (8802) rain H4306 upon H6440 the earth H0776, and sendeth H7971 (8802) waters H4325 upon H6440 the fields H2351:
005:011 To set up H7760 (8800) on high H4791 those that be low H8217; that those which mourn H6937 (8802) may be exalted H7682 (8804) to safety H3468.
005:012 He disappointeth H6565 (8688) the devices H4284 of the crafty H6175, so that their hands H3027 cannot perform H6213 (8799) [their] enterprise H8454.
005:013 He taketh H3920 (8802) the wise H2450 in their own craftiness H6193: and the counsel H6098 of the froward H6617 (8737) is carried headlong H4116 (8737).
005:014 They meet H6298 (8762) with darkness H2822 in the daytime H3119, and grope H4959 (8762) in the noonday H6672 as in the night H3915.
005:015 But he saveth H3467 (8686) the poor H0034 from the sword H2719, from their mouth H6310, and from the hand H3027 of the mighty H2389.
005:016 So the poor H1800 hath hope H8615, and iniquity H5766 stoppeth H7092 (8804) her mouth H6310.
005:017 Behold, happy H0835 [is] the man H0582 whom God H0433 correcteth H3198 (8686): therefore despise H3988 (8799) not thou the chastening H4148 of the Almighty H7706:
005:018 For he maketh sore H3510 (8686), and bindeth up H2280 (8799): he woundeth H4272 (8799), and his hands H3027 make whole H7495 (8799).
005:019 He shall deliver H5337 (8686) thee in six H8337 troubles H6869: yea, in seven H7651 there shall no evil H7451 touch H5060 (8799) thee.
005:020 In famine H7458 he shall redeem H6299 (8804) thee from death H4194: and in war H4421 from the power H3027 of the sword H2719.
005:021 Thou shalt be hid H2244 (8735) from the scourge H7752 of the tongue H3956: neither shalt thou be afraid H3372 (8799) of destruction H7701 when it cometh H0935 (8799).
005:022 At destruction H7701 and famine H3720 thou shalt laugh H7832 (8799): neither shalt thou be afraid H3372 (8799) of the beasts H2416 of the earth H0776.
005:023 For thou shalt be in league H1285 with the stones H0068 of the field H7704: and the beasts H2416 of the field H7704 shall be at peace H7999 (8717) with thee.
005:024 And thou shalt know H3045 (8804) that thy tabernacle H0168 [shall be] in peace H7965; and thou shalt visit H6485 (8804) thy habitation H5116, and shalt not sin H2398 (8799).
005:025 Thou shalt know H3045 (8804) also that thy seed H2233 [shall be] great H7227, and thine offspring H6631 as the grass H6212 of the earth H0776.
005:026 Thou shalt come H0935 (8799) to [thy] grave H6913 in a full age H3624, like as a shock of corn H1430 cometh in H5927 (8800) in his season H6256.
005:027 Lo this, we have searched H2713 (8804) it, so it [is]; hear H8085 (8798) it, and know H3045 (8798) thou [it] for thy good.
006:001 ¶  But Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
006:002 Oh that H3863 my grief H3708 were throughly H8254 (8800) weighed H8254 (8735), and my calamity H1942 (8675) H1962 laid H5375 (8799) in the balances H3976 together H3162!
006:003 For now it would be heavier H3513 (8799) than the sand H2344 of the sea H3220: therefore my words H1697 are swallowed up H3886 (8804).
006:004 For the arrows H2671 of the Almighty H7706 [are] within H5978 me, the poison H2534 whereof drinketh up H8354 (8802) my spirit H7307: the terrors H1161 of God H0433 do set themselves in array H6186 (8799) against me.
006:005 Doth the wild ass H6501 bray H5101 (8799) when he hath grass H1877? or loweth H1600 (8799) the ox H7794 over his fodder H1098?
006:006 Can that which is unsavoury H8602 be eaten H0398 (8735) without salt H4417? or is there H3426 [any] taste H2940 in the white H7388 of an egg H2495?
006:007 The things [that] my soul H5315 refused H3985 (8765) to touch H5060 (8800) [are] as my sorrowful H1741 meat H3899.
006:008 Oh that I might have H0935 (8799) my request H7596; and that God H0433 would grant H5414 (8799) [me] the thing that I long for H8615!
006:009 Even that it would please H2974 (8686) God H0433 to destroy H1792 (8762) me; that he would let loose H5425 (8686) his hand H3027, and cut me off H1214 (8762)!
006:010 Then should I yet have comfort H5165; yea, I would harden H5539 (8762) myself in sorrow H2427: let him not spare H2550 (8799); for I have not concealed H3582 (8765) the words H0561 of the Holy One H6918.
006:011 What [is] my strength H3581, that I should hope H3176 (8762)? and what [is] mine end H7093, that I should prolong H0748 (8686) my life H5315?
006:012 [Is] my strength H3581 the strength H3581 of stones H0068? or [is] my flesh H1320 of brass H5153?
006:013 [Is] not my help H5833 in me? and is wisdom H8454 driven quite H5080 (8738) from me?
006:014 To him that is afflicted H4523 pity H2617 [should be shewed] from his friend H7453; but he forsaketh H5800 (8799) the fear H3374 of the Almighty H7706.
006:015 My brethren H0251 have dealt deceitfully H0898 (8804) as a brook H5158, [and] as the stream H0650 of brooks H5158 they pass away H5674 (8799);
006:016 Which are blackish H6937 (8802) by reason of the ice H7140, [and] wherein the snow H7950 is hid H5956 (8691):
006:017 What time H6256 they wax warm H2215 (8792), they vanish H6789 (8738): when it is hot H2527, they are consumed out H1846 (8738) of their place H4725.
006:018 The paths H0734 of their way H1870 are turned aside H3943 (8735); they go H5927 (8799) to nothing H8414, and perish H0006 (8799).
006:019 The troops H0734 of Tema H8485 looked H5027 (8689), the companies H1979 of Sheba H7614 waited H6960 (8765) for them.
006:020 They were confounded H0954 (8804) because they had hoped H0982 (8804); they came H0935 (8804) thither, and were ashamed H2659 (8799).
006:021 For now ye are nothing; ye see H7200 (8799) [my] casting down H2866, and are afraid H3372 (8799).
006:022 Did I say H0559 (8804), Bring H3051 (8798) unto me? or, Give a reward H7809 (8798) for me of your substance H3581?
006:023 Or, Deliver H4422 (8761) me from the enemy’s H6862 hand H3027? or, Redeem H6299 (8799) me from the hand H3027 of the mighty H6184?
006:024 Teach H3384 (8685) me, and I will hold my tongue H2790 (8686): and cause me to understand H0995 (8685) wherein I have erred H7686 (8804).
006:025 How forcible H4834 (8738) are right H3476 words H0561! but what doth your arguing H3198 (8687) reprove H3198 (8686)?
006:026 Do ye imagine H2803 (8799) to reprove H3198 (8687) words H4405, and the speeches H0561 of one that is desperate H2976 (8737), [which are] as wind H7307?
006:027 Yea, ye overwhelm H5307 (8686) the fatherless H3490, and ye dig H3738 (8799) [a pit] for your friend H7453.
006:028 Now therefore be content H2974 (8685), look H6437 (8798) upon me; for [it is] evident H6440 unto you if I lie H3576 (8762).
006:029 Return H7725 (8798), I pray you, let it not be iniquity H5766; yea, return again H7725 (8798), my righteousness H6664 [is] in it.
006:030 Is there H3426 iniquity H5766 in my tongue H3956? cannot my taste H2441 discern H0995 (8799) perverse things H1942?
007:001 ¶  [Is there] not an appointed time H6635 to man H0582 upon earth H0776? [are not] his days H3117 also like the days H3117 of an hireling H7916?
007:002 As a servant H5650 earnestly desireth H7602 (8799) the shadow H6738, and as an hireling H7916 looketh H6960 (8762) for [the reward of] his work H6467:
007:003 So am I made to possess H5157 (8717) months H3391 of vanity H7723, and wearisome H5999 nights H3915 are appointed H4487 (8765) to me.
007:004 When I lie down H7901 (8804), I say H0559 (8804), When shall I arise H6965 (8799), and the night H6153 be gone H4059? and I am full H7646 (8804) of tossings to and fro H5076 unto the dawning of the day H5399.
007:005 My flesh H1320 is clothed H3847 (8804) with worms H7415 and clods H1487 of dust H6083; my skin H5785 is broken H7280 (8804), and become loathsome H3988 (8735).
007:006 My days H3117 are swifter H7043 (8804) than a weaver’s shuttle H0708, and are spent H3615 (8799) without H0657 hope H8615.
007:007 O remember H2142 (8798) that my life H2416 [is] wind H7307: mine eye H5869 shall no more H7725 (8799) see H7200 (8800) good H2896.
007:008 The eye H5869 of him that hath seen H7210 me shall see H7789 (8799) me no [more]: thine eyes H5869 [are] upon me, and I [am] not.
007:009 [As] the cloud H6051 is consumed H3615 (8804) and vanisheth away H3212 (8799): so he that goeth down H3381 (8802) to the grave H7585 shall come up H5927 (8799) no [more].
007:010 He shall return H7725 (8799) no more to his house H1004, neither shall his place H4725 know H5234 (8686) him any more.
007:011 Therefore I will not refrain H2820 (8799) my mouth H6310; I will speak H1696 (8762) in the anguish H6862 of my spirit H7307; I will complain H7878 (8799) in the bitterness H4751 of my soul H5315.
007:012 [Am] I a sea H3220, or a whale H8577, that thou settest H7760 (8799) a watch H4929 over me?
007:013 When I say H0559 (8804), My bed H6210 shall comfort H5162 (8762) me, my couch H4904 shall ease H5375 (8799) my complaint H7879;
007:014 Then thou scarest H2865 (8765) me with dreams H2472, and terrifiest H1204 (8762) me through visions H2384:
007:015 So that my soul H5315 chooseth H0977 (8799) strangling H4267, [and] death H4194 rather than my life H6106.
007:016 I loathe H3988 (8804) [it]; I would not live H2421 (8799) alway H5769: let me alone H2308 (8798); for my days H3117 [are] vanity H1892.
007:017 What [is] man H0582, that thou shouldest magnify H1431 (8762) him? and that thou shouldest set H7896 (8799) thine heart H3820 upon him?
007:018 And [that] thou shouldest visit H6485 (8799) him every morning H1242, [and] try H0974 (8799) him every moment H7281?
007:019 How long H4100 wilt thou not depart H8159 (8799) from me, nor let me alone H7503 (8686) till I swallow down H1104 (8800) my spittle H7536?
007:020 I have sinned H2398 (8804); what shall I do H6466 (8799) unto thee, O thou preserver H5341 (8802) of men H0120? why hast thou set H7760 (8804) me as a mark H4645 against thee, so that I am a burden H4853 to myself?
007:021 And why dost thou not pardon H5375 (8799) my transgression H6588, and take away H5674 (8686) mine iniquity H5771? for now shall I sleep H7901 (8799) in the dust H6083; and thou shalt seek me in the morning H7836 (8765), but I [shall] not [be].
008:001 ¶  Then answered H6030 (8799) Bildad H1085 the Shuhite H7747, and said H0559 (8799),
008:002 How H0575 long H5704 wilt thou speak H4448 (8762) these [things]? and [how long shall] the words H0561 of thy mouth H6310 [be like] a strong H3524 wind H7307?
008:003 Doth God H0410 pervert H5791 (8762) judgment H4941? or doth the Almighty H7706 pervert H5791 (8762) justice H6664?
008:004 If thy children H1121 have sinned H2398 (8804) against him, and he have cast them away H7971 (8762) for H3027 their transgression H6588;
008:005 If thou wouldest seek H7836 unto God H0410 betimes H7836 (8762), and make thy supplication H2603 (8691) to the Almighty H7706;
008:006 If thou [wert] pure H2134 and upright H3477; surely now he would awake H5782 (8686) for thee, and make the habitation H5116 of thy righteousness H6664 prosperous H7999 (8765).
008:007 Though thy beginning H7225 was small H4705, yet thy latter end H0319 should greatly H3966 increase H7685 (8799).
008:008 For enquire H7592 (8798), I pray thee, of the former H7223 (8675) H7223 age H1755, and prepare H3559 (8786) thyself to the search H2714 of their fathers H0001:
008:009 (For we [are but of] yesterday H8543, and know H3045 (8799) nothing, because our days H3117 upon earth H0776 [are] a shadow H6738:)
008:010 Shall not they teach H3384 (8686) thee, [and] tell H0559 (8799) thee, and utter H3318 (8686) words H4405 out of their heart H3820?
008:011 Can the rush H1573 grow up H1342 (8799) without mire H1207? can H7685 the flag H0260 grow H7685 (8799) without H1097 water H4325?
008:012 Whilst it [is] yet in his greenness H0003, [and] not cut down H6998 (8735), it withereth H3001 (8799) before H6440 any [other] herb H2682.
008:013 So [are] the paths H0734 of all that forget H7911 (8802) God H0410; and the hypocrite’s H2611 hope H8615 shall perish H0006 (8799):
008:014 Whose hope H3689 shall be cut off H6990 (8799), and whose trust H4009 [shall be] a spider’s H5908 web H1004.
008:015 He shall lean H8172 (8735) upon his house H1004, but it shall not stand H5975 (8799): he shall hold H2388 (8686) it fast, but it shall not endure H6965 (8799).
008:016 He [is] green H7373 before H6440 the sun H8121, and his branch H3127 shooteth forth H3318 (8799) in his garden H1593.
008:017 His roots H8328 are wrapped about H5440 (8792) the heap H1530, [and] seeth H2372 (8799) the place H1004 of stones H0068.
008:018 If he destroy H1104 (8762) him from his place H4725, then [it] shall deny H3584 (8765) him, [saying], I have not seen H7200 (8804) thee.
008:019 Behold, this [is] the joy H4885 of his way H1870, and out of the earth H6083 shall others H0312 grow H6779 (8799).
008:020 Behold, God H0410 will not cast away H3988 (8799) a perfect H8535 [man], neither will he help H2388 (8686) H3027 the evil doers H7489 (8688):
008:021 Till he fill H4390 (8762) thy mouth H6310 with laughing H7814, and thy lips H8193 with rejoicing H8643.
008:022 They that hate H8130 (8802) thee shall be clothed H3847 (8799) with shame H1322; and the dwelling H0168 place of the wicked H7563 shall come to nought H0369.
009:001 ¶  Then Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
009:002 I know H3045 (8804) [it is] so of a truth H0551: but how should man H0582 be just H6663 (8799) with God H0410?
009:003 If he will H2654 (8799) contend H7378 (8800) with him, he cannot answer H6030 (8799) him one H0259 of a thousand H0505.
009:004 [He is] wise H2450 in heart H3824, and mighty H0533 in strength H3581: who hath hardened H7185 (8689) [himself] against him, and hath prospered H7999 (8799)?
009:005 Which removeth H6275 (8688) the mountains H2022, and they know H3045 (8804) not: which overturneth H2015 (8804) them in his anger H0639.
009:006 Which shaketh H7264 (8688) the earth H0776 out of her place H4725, and the pillars H5982 thereof tremble H6426 (8691).
009:007 Which commandeth H0559 (8802) the sun H2775, and it riseth H2224 (8799) not; and sealeth up H2856 (8799) the stars H3556.
009:008 Which alone spreadeth out H5186 (8802) the heavens H8064, and treadeth H1869 (8802) upon the waves H1116 of the sea H3220.
009:009 Which maketh H6213 (8802) Arcturus H5906, Orion H3685, and Pleiades H3598, and the chambers H2315 of the south H8486.
009:010 Which doeth H6213 (8802) great things H1419 past H0369 finding out H2714; yea, and wonders H6381 (8737) without number H4557.
009:011 Lo, he goeth H5674 (8799) by me, and I see H7200 (8799) [him] not: he passeth on H2498 (8799) also, but I perceive H0995 (8799) him not.
009:012 Behold, he taketh away H2862 (8799), who can hinder H7725 (8686) him? who will say H0559 (8799) unto him, What doest H6213 (8799) thou?
009:013 [If] God H0433 will not withdraw H7725 (8686) his anger H0639, the proud H7293 helpers H5826 (8802) do stoop H7817 (8804) under him.
009:014 How much less shall I answer H6030 (8799) him, [and] choose out H0977 (8799) my words H1697 [to reason] with him?
009:015 Whom, though I were righteous H6663 (8804), [yet] would I not answer H6030 (8799), [but] I would make supplication H2603 (8691) to my judge H8199 (8781).
009:016 If I had called H7121 (8804), and he had answered H6030 (8799) me; [yet] would I not believe H0539 (8686) that he had hearkened H0238 (8686) unto my voice H6963.
009:017 For he breaketh H7779 (8799) me with a tempest H8183, and multiplieth H7235 (8689) my wounds H6482 without cause H2600.
009:018 He will not suffer H5414 (8799) me to take H7725 (8687) my breath H7307, but filleth H7646 (8686) me with bitterness H4472.
009:019 If [I speak] of strength H3581, lo, [he is] strong H0533: and if of judgment H4941, who shall set H3259 (8686) me a time [to plead]?
009:020 If I justify H6663 (8799) myself, mine own mouth H6310 shall condemn H7561 (8686) me: [if I say], I [am] perfect H8535, it shall also prove me perverse H6140 (8799).
009:021 [Though] I [were] perfect H8535, [yet] would I not know H3045 (8799) my soul H5315: I would despise H3988 (8799) my life H2416.
009:022 This [is] one H0259 [thing], therefore I said H0559 (8804) [it], He destroyeth H3615 (8764) the perfect H8535 and the wicked H7563.
009:023 If the scourge H7752 slay H4191 (8686) suddenly H6597, he will laugh H3932 (8799) at the trial H4531 of the innocent H5355.
009:024 The earth H0776 is given H5414 (8738) into the hand H3027 of the wicked H7563: he covereth H3680 (8762) the faces H6440 of the judges H8199 (8802) thereof; if not, where H0645, [and] who [is] he?
009:025 Now my days H3117 are swifter H7043 (8804) than a post H7323 (8801): they flee away H1272 (8804), they see H7200 (8804) no good H2896.
009:026 They are passed away H2498 (8804) as H5973 the swift H0016 ships H0591: as the eagle H5404 [that] hasteth H2907 (8799) to the prey H0400.
009:027 If I say H0559 (8800), I will forget H7911 (8799) my complaint H7879, I will leave off H5800 (8799) my heaviness H6440, and comfort H1082 (8686) [myself]:
009:028 I am afraid H3025 (8804) of all my sorrows H6094, I know H3045 (8804) that thou wilt not hold me innocent H5352 (8762).
009:029 [If] I be wicked H7561 (8799), why then labour H3021 (8799) I in vain H1892?
009:030 If I wash H7364 (8694) myself with H7950 snow water H4325 H1119, and make my hands H3709 never H1252 (8676) H1253 so clean H2141 (8689);
009:031 Yet H0227 shalt thou plunge H2881 (8799) me in the ditch H7845, and mine own clothes H8008 shall abhor H8581 (8765) me.
009:032 For [he is] not a man H0376, as I [am, that] I should answer H6030 (8799) him, [and] we should come H0935 (8799) together H3162 in judgment H4941.
009:033 Neither is H3426 there any daysman H3198 (8688) betwixt us, [that] might lay H7896 (8799) his hand H3027 upon us both H8147.
009:034 Let him take H5493 his rod H7626 away H5493 (8686) from me, and let not his fear H0367 terrify H1204 (8762) me:
009:035 [Then] would I speak H1696 (8762), and not fear H3372 (8799) him; but [it is] not so with me.
010:001 ¶  My soul H5315 is weary H5354 (8804) of my life H2416; I will leave H5800 (8799) my complaint H7879 upon myself; I will speak H1696 (8762) in the bitterness H4751 of my soul H5315.
010:002 I will say H0559 (8799) unto God H0433, Do not condemn H7561 (8686) me; shew H3045 (8685) me wherefore thou contendest H7378 (8799) with me.
010:003 [Is it] good H2895 (8804) unto thee that thou shouldest oppress H6231 (8799), that thou shouldest despise H3988 (8799) the work H3018 of thine hands H3709, and shine H3313 (8689) upon the counsel H6098 of the wicked H7563?
010:004 Hast thou eyes H5869 of flesh H1320? or seest H7200 (8799) thou as man H0582 seeth H7200 (8800)?
010:005 [Are] thy days H3117 as the days H3117 of man H0582? [are] thy years H8141 as man’s H1397 days H3117,
010:006 That thou enquirest H1245 (8762) after mine iniquity H5771, and searchest H1875 (8799) after my sin H2403?
010:007 Thou knowest H1847 that I am not wicked H7561 (8799); and [there is] none that can deliver H5337 (8688) out of thine hand H3027.
010:008 Thine hands H3027 have made H6087 (8765) me and fashioned H6213 (8799) me together H3162 round about H5439; yet thou dost destroy H1104 (8762) me.
010:009 Remember H2142 (8798), I beseech thee, that thou hast made H6213 (8804) me as the clay H2563; and wilt thou bring H7725 me into dust H6083 again H7725 (8686)?
010:010 Hast thou not poured me out H5413 (8686) as milk H2461, and curdled H7087 (8686) me like cheese H1385?
010:011 Thou hast clothed H3847 (8686) me with skin H5785 and flesh H1320, and hast fenced H7753 (8787) me with bones H6106 and sinews H1517.
010:012 Thou hast granted H6213 (8804) me life H2416 and favour H2617, and thy visitation H6486 hath preserved H8104 (8804) my spirit H7307.
010:013 And these [things] hast thou hid H6845 (8804) in thine heart H3824: I know H3045 (8804) that this [is] with thee.
010:014 If I sin H2398 (8804), then thou markest H8104 (8804) me, and thou wilt not acquit H5352 (8762) me from mine iniquity H5771.
010:015 If I be wicked H7561 (8804), woe H0480 unto me; and [if] I be righteous H6663 (8804), [yet] will I not lift up H5375 (8799) my head H7218. [I am] full H7649 of confusion H7036; therefore see H7202 (8798) (8676) H7200 (8798) thou mine affliction H6040;
010:016 For it increaseth H1342 (8799). Thou huntest H6679 (8799) me as a fierce lion H7826: and again H7725 (8799) thou shewest thyself marvellous H6381 (8691) upon me.
010:017 Thou renewest H2318 (8762) thy witnesses H5707 against me, and increasest H7235 (8686) thine indignation H3708 upon me H5978; changes H2487 and war H6635 [are] against me.
010:018 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth H3318 (8689) out of the womb H7358? Oh that I had given up the ghost H1478 (8799), and no eye H5869 had seen H7200 (8799) me!
010:019 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried H2986 (8714) from the womb H0990 to the grave H6913.
010:020 [Are] not my days H3117 few H4592? cease H2308 (8798) (8675) H2308 (8799) [then, and] let me alone H7896 (8798) (8675) H7896 (8799), that I may take comfort H1082 (8686) a little H4592,
010:021 Before I go H3212 (8799) [whence] I shall not return H7725 (8799), [even] to the land H0776 of darkness H2822 and the shadow of death H6757;
010:022 A land H0776 of darkness H5890, as darkness H0652 [itself; and] of the shadow of death H6757, without any order H5468, and [where] the light H3313 (8686) [is] as darkness H0652.
011:001 ¶  Then answered H6030 (8799) Zophar H6691 the Naamathite H5284, and said H0559 (8799),
011:002 Should not the multitude H7230 of words H1697 be answered H6030 (8735)? and should a man H0376 full of talk H8193 be justified H6663 (8799)?
011:003 Should thy lies H0907 make H2790 men H4962 hold their peace H2790 (8686)? and when thou mockest H3932 (8799), shall no man make thee ashamed H3637 (8688)?
011:004 For thou hast said H0559 (8799), My doctrine H3948 [is] pure H2134, and I am clean H1249 in thine eyes H5869.
011:005 But H0199 oh that H5414 (8799) God H0433 would speak H1696 (8763), and open H6605 (8799) his lips H8193 against thee;
011:006 And that he would shew H5046 (8686) thee the secrets H8587 of wisdom H2451, that [they are] double H3718 to that which is H8454! Know H3045 (8798) therefore that God H0433 exacteth H5382 (8686) of thee [less] than thine iniquity H5771 [deserveth].
011:007 Canst thou by searching H2714 find out H4672 (8799) God H0433? canst thou find H4672 (8799) out the Almighty H7706 unto perfection H8503?
011:008 [It is] as high H1363 as heaven H8064; what canst thou do H6466 (8799)? deeper H6013 than hell H7585; what canst thou know H3045 (8799)?
011:009 The measure H4055 thereof [is] longer H0752 than the earth H0776, and broader H7342 than the sea H3220.
011:010 If he cut off H2498 (8799), and shut up H5462 (8686), or gather together H6950 (8686), then who can hinder H7725 (8686) him?
011:011 For he knoweth H3045 (8804) vain H7723 men H4962: he seeth H7200 (8799) wickedness H0205 also; will he not then consider H0995 (8709) [it]?
011:012 For vain H5014 (8803) man H0376 would be wise H3823 (8735), though man H0120 be born H3205 (8735) [like] a wild ass’s H6501 colt H5895.
011:013 If thou prepare H3559 (8689) thine heart H3820, and stretch H6566 (8804) out thine hands H3709 toward him;
011:014 If iniquity H0205 [be] in thine hand H3027, put it far away H7368 (8685), and let not wickedness H5766 dwell H7931 (8686) in thy tabernacles H0168.
011:015 For then shalt thou lift up H5375 (8799) thy face H6440 without spot H3971; yea, thou shalt be stedfast H3332 (8716), and shalt not fear H3372 (8799):
011:016 Because thou shalt forget H7911 (8799) [thy] misery H5999, [and] remember H2142 (8799) [it] as waters H4325 [that] pass away H5674 (8804):
011:017 And [thine] age H2465 shall be clearer H6965 (8799) than the noonday H6672; thou shalt shine forth H5774 (8799), thou shalt be as the morning H1242.
011:018 And thou shalt be secure H0982 (8804), because there is H3426 hope H8615; yea, thou shalt dig H2658 (8804) [about thee, and] thou shalt take thy rest H7901 (8799) in safety H0983.
011:019 Also thou shalt lie down H7257 (8804), and none shall make [thee] afraid H2729 (8688); yea, many H7227 shall make suit H2470 (8765) unto thee H6440.
011:020 But the eyes H5869 of the wicked H7563 shall fail H3615 (8799), and they shall not escape H0006 (8804) H4498, and their hope H8615 [shall be as] the giving up H4646 of the ghost H5315.
012:001 ¶  And Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
012:002 No doubt H0551 but ye [are] the people H5971, and wisdom H2451 shall die H4191 (8799) with you.
012:003 But H1571 I have understanding H3824 as well as you; I [am] not inferior H5307 (8802) to you: yea, who knoweth not such things H3644 as these?
012:004 I am [as] one mocked H7814 of his neighbour H7453, who calleth H7121 (8802) upon God H0433, and he answereth H6030 (8799) him: the just H6662 upright H8549 [man is] laughed to scorn H7814.
012:005 He that is ready H3559 (8737) to slip H4571 (8802) with [his] feet H7272 [is as] a lamp H3940 despised H0937 in the thought H6248 of him that is at ease H7600.
012:006 The tabernacles H0168 of robbers H7703 (8802) prosper H7951 (8799), and they that provoke H7264 (8688) God H0410 are secure H0987; into whose hand H3027 God H0433 bringeth H0935 (8689) [abundantly].
012:007 But H0199 ask H7592 (8798) now the beasts H0929, and they shall teach H3384 (8686) thee; and the fowls H5775 of the air H8064, and they shall tell H5046 (8686) thee:
012:008 Or speak H7878 (8798) to the earth H0776, and it shall teach H3384 (8686) thee: and the fishes H1709 of the sea H3220 shall declare H5608 (8762) unto thee.
012:009 Who knoweth H3045 (8804) not in all these that the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 hath wrought H6213 (8804) this?
012:010 In whose hand H3027 [is] the soul H5315 of every living thing H2416, and the breath H7307 of all mankind H0376 H1320.
012:011 Doth not the ear H0241 try H0974 (8799) words H4405? and the mouth H2441 taste H2938 (8799) his meat H0400?
012:012 With the ancient H3453 [is] wisdom H2451; and in length H0753 of days H3117 understanding H8394.
012:013 With him [is] wisdom H2451 and strength H1369, he hath counsel H6098 and understanding H8394.
012:014 Behold, he breaketh down H2040 (8799), and it cannot be built again H1129 (8735): he shutteth up H5462 (8799) a man H0376, and there can be no opening H6605 (8735).
012:015 Behold, he withholdeth H6113 (8799) the waters H4325, and they dry up H3001 (8799): also he sendeth them out H7971 (8762), and they overturn H2015 (8799) the earth H0776.
012:016 With him [is] strength H5797 and wisdom H8454: the deceived H7683 (8802) and the deceiver H7686 (8688) [are] his.
012:017 He leadeth H3212 (8688) counsellors H3289 (8802) away spoiled H7758, and maketh the judges H8199 (8802) fools H1984 (8779).
012:018 He looseth H6605 (8765) the bond H4148 of kings H4428, and girdeth H0631 (8799) their loins H4975 with a girdle H0232.
012:019 He leadeth H3212 (8688) princes H3548 away spoiled H7758, and overthroweth H5557 (8762) the mighty H0386.
012:020 He removeth away H5493 (8688) the speech H8193 of the trusty H0539 (8737), and taketh away H3947 (8799) the understanding H2940 of the aged H2205.
012:021 He poureth H8210 (8802) contempt H0937 upon princes H5081, and weakeneth H7503 (8765) the strength H4206 of the mighty H0650.
012:022 He discovereth H1540 (8764) deep things H6013 out of darkness H2822, and bringeth out H3318 (8686) to light H0216 the shadow of death H6757.
012:023 He increaseth H7679 (8688) the nations H1471, and destroyeth H0006 (8762) them: he enlargeth H7849 (8802) the nations H1471, and straiteneth H5148 (8686) them [again].
012:024 He taketh away H5493 (8688) the heart H3820 of the chief H7218 of the people H5971 of the earth H0776, and causeth them to wander H8582 (8686) in a wilderness H8414 [where there is] no way H1870.
012:025 They grope H4959 (8762) in the dark H2822 without light H0216, and he maketh them to stagger H8582 (8686) like [a] drunken H7910 [man].
013:001 ¶  Lo, mine eye H5869 hath seen H7200 (8804) all [this], mine ear H0241 hath heard H8085 (8804) and understood H0995 (8799) it.
013:002 What ye know H1847, [the same] do I know H3045 (8804) also: I [am] not inferior H5307 (8802) unto you.
013:003 Surely H0199 I would speak H1696 (8762) to the Almighty H7706, and I desire H2654 (8799) to reason H3198 (8687) with God H0410.
013:004 But H0199 ye [are] forgers H2950 (8802) of lies H8267, ye [are] all physicians H7495 (8802) of no value H0457.
013:005 O that H5414 (8799) ye would altogether H2790 (8687) hold your peace H2790 (8686)! and it should be your wisdom H2451.
013:006 Hear H8085 (8798) now my reasoning H8433, and hearken H7181 (8685) to the pleadings H7379 of my lips H8193.
013:007 Will ye speak H1696 (8762) wickedly H5766 for God H0410? and talk H1696 (8762) deceitfully H7423 for him?
013:008 Will ye accept H5375 (8799) his person H6440? will ye contend H7378 (8799) for God H0410?
013:009 Is it good H2895 (8804) that he should search you out H2713 (8799)? or as one man H0582 mocketh H2048 (8763) another, do ye [so] mock H2048 (8762) him?
013:010 He will surely H3198 (8687) reprove H3198 (8686) you, if ye do secretly H5643 accept H5375 (8799) persons H6440.
013:011 Shall not his excellency H7613 make you afraid H1204 (8762)? and his dread H6343 fall H5307 (8799) upon you?
013:012 Your remembrances H2146 [are] like H4912 unto ashes H0665, your bodies H1354 to bodies H1354 of clay H2563.
013:013 Hold your peace H2790 (8685), let me alone, that I may speak H1696 (8762), and let come H5674 (8799) on me what [will].
013:014 Wherefore do I take H5375 (8799) my flesh H1320 in my teeth H8127, and put H7760 (8799) my life H5315 in mine hand H3709?
013:015 Though H2005 he slay H6991 (8799) me, yet will I trust H3176 (8762) in him: but I will maintain H3198 (8686) mine own ways H1870 before H6440 him.
013:016 He also [shall be] my salvation H3444: for an hypocrite H2611 shall not come H0935 (8799) before H6440 him.
013:017 Hear H8085 (8798) diligently H8085 (8800) my speech H4405, and my declaration H0262 with your ears H0241.
013:018 Behold now, I have ordered H6186 (8804) [my] cause H4941; I know H3045 (8804) that I shall be justified H6663 (8799).
013:019 Who [is] he [that] will plead H7378 (8799) with me? for now, if I hold my tongue H2790 (8686), I shall give up the ghost H1478 (8799).
013:020 Only do H6213 (8799) not two H8147 [things] unto me: then will I not hide H5641 (8735) myself from thee H6440.
013:021 Withdraw H7368 thine hand H3709 far H7368 (8685) from me: and let not thy dread H0367 make me afraid H1204 (8762).
013:022 Then call H7121 (8798) thou, and I will answer H6030 (8799): or let me speak H1696 (8762), and answer H7725 (8685) thou me.
013:023 How many [are] mine iniquities H5771 and sins H2403? make me to know H3045 (8685) my transgression H6588 and my sin H2403.
013:024 Wherefore hidest H5641 (8686) thou thy face H6440, and holdest H2803 (8799) me for thine enemy H0341 (8802)?
013:025 Wilt thou break H6206 (8799) a leaf H5929 driven to and fro H5086 (8737)? and wilt thou pursue H7291 (8799) the dry H3002 stubble H7179?
013:026 For thou writest H3789 (8799) bitter things H4846 against me, and makest me to possess H3423 (8686) the iniquities H5771 of my youth H5271.
013:027 Thou puttest H7760 (8799) my feet H7272 also in the stocks H5465, and lookest narrowly H8104 (8799) unto all my paths H0734; thou settest a print H2707 (8691) upon the heels H8328 of my feet H7272.
013:028 And he, as a rotten thing H7538, consumeth H1086 (8799), as a garment H0899 that is moth H6211 eaten H0398 (8804).
014:001 ¶  Man H0120 [that is] born H3205 (8803) of a woman H0802 [is] of few H7116 days H3117, and full H7649 of trouble H7267.
014:002 He cometh forth H3318 (8804) like a flower H6731, and is cut down H5243 (8799): he fleeth H1272 (8799) also as a shadow H6738, and continueth H5975 (8799) not.
014:003 And dost thou open H6491 (8804) thine eyes H5869 upon such an one H2088, and bringest H0935 (8686) me into judgment H4941 with thee?
014:004 Who can bring H5414 (8799) a clean H2889 [thing] out of an unclean H2931? not one H0259.
014:005 Seeing H0518 his days H3117 [are] determined H2782 (8803), the number H4557 of his months H2320 [are] with thee, thou hast appointed H6213 (8804) his bounds H2706 that he cannot pass H5674 (8799);
014:006 Turn H8159 (8798) from him, that he may rest H2308 (8799), till he shall accomplish H7521 (8799), as an hireling H7916, his day H3117.
014:007 For there is H3426 hope H8615 of a tree H6086, if it be cut down H3772 (8735), that it will sprout again H2498 (8686), and that the tender branch H3127 thereof will not cease H2308 (8799).
014:008 Though the root H8328 thereof wax old H2204 (8686) in the earth H0776, and the stock H1503 thereof die H4191 (8799) in the ground H6083;
014:009 [Yet] through the scent H7381 of water H4325 it will bud H6524 (8686), and bring forth H6213 (8804) boughs H7105 like a plant H5194.
014:010 But man H1397 dieth H4191 (8799), and wasteth away H2522 (8799): yea, man H0120 giveth up the ghost H1478 (8799), and where [is] he?
014:011 [As] the waters H4325 fail H0235 (8804) from the sea H3220, and the flood H5104 decayeth H2717 (8799) and drieth up H3001 (8804):
014:012 So man H0376 lieth down H7901 (8804), and riseth H6965 (8799) not: till the heavens H8064 [be] no more H1115, they shall not awake H6974 (8686), nor be raised out H5782 (8735) of their sleep H8142.
014:013 O that H5414 (8799) thou wouldest hide H6845 (8686) me in the grave H7585, that thou wouldest keep me secret H5641 (8686), until thy wrath H0639 be past H7725 (8800), that thou wouldest appoint H7896 (8799) me a set time H2706, and remember H2142 (8799) me!
014:014 If a man H1397 die H4191 (8799), shall he live H2421 (8799) [again]? all the days H3117 of my appointed time H6635 will I wait H3176 (8762), till my change H2487 come H0935 (8800).
014:015 Thou shalt call H7121 (8799), and I will answer H6030 (8799) thee: thou wilt have a desire H3700 (8799) to the work H4639 of thine hands H3027.
014:016 For now thou numberest H5608 (8799) my steps H6806: dost thou not watch H8104 (8799) over my sin H2403?
014:017 My transgression H6588 [is] sealed up H2856 (8803) in a bag H6872, and thou sewest up H2950 (8799) mine iniquity H5771.
014:018 And surely H0199 the mountain H2022 falling H5307 (8802) cometh to nought H5034 (8799), and the rock H6697 is removed H6275 (8799) out of his place H4725.
014:019 The waters H4325 wear H7833 (8804) the stones H0068: thou washest away H7857 (8799) the things which grow H5599 [out] of the dust H6083 of the earth H0776; and thou destroyest H0006 (8689) the hope H8615 of man H0582.
014:020 Thou prevailest H8630 (8799) for ever H5331 against him, and he passeth H1980 (8799): thou changest H8138 (8764) his countenance H6440, and sendest him away H7971 (8762).
014:021 His sons H1121 come to honour H3513 (8799), and he knoweth H3045 (8799) [it] not; and they are brought low H6819 (8799), but he perceiveth H0995 (8799) [it] not of them.
014:022 But his flesh H1320 upon him shall have pain H3510 (8799), and his soul H5315 within him shall mourn H0056 (8799).
015:001 ¶  Then answered H6030 (8799) Eliphaz H0464 the Temanite H8489, and said H0559 (8799),
015:002 Should a wise man H2450 utter H6030 (8799) vain H7307 knowledge H1847, and fill H4390 (8762) his belly H0990 with the east wind H6921?
015:003 Should he reason H3198 (8687) with unprofitable H5532 (8799) talk H1697? or with speeches H4405 wherewith he can do no good H3276 (8686)?
015:004 Yea, thou castest off H6565 (8686) fear H3374, and restrainest H1639 (8799) prayer H7881 before H6440 God H0410.
015:005 For thy mouth H6310 uttereth H0502 (8762) thine iniquity H5771, and thou choosest H0977 (8799) the tongue H3956 of the crafty H6175.
015:006 Thine own mouth H6310 condemneth H7561 (8686) thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips H8193 testify H6030 (8799) against thee.
015:007 [Art] thou the first H7223 (8675) H7223 man H0120 [that] was born H3205 (8735)? or wast thou made H2342 (8797) before H6440 the hills H1389?
015:008 Hast thou heard H8085 (8799) the secret H5475 of God H0433? and dost thou restrain H1639 (8799) wisdom H2451 to thyself?
015:009 What knowest H3045 (8804) thou, that we know H3045 (8799) not? [what] understandest H0995 (8799) thou, which [is] not in us?
015:010 With us [are] both the grayheaded H7867 (8802) and very aged H3453 men, much H3524 elder H3117 than thy father H0001.
015:011 [Are] the consolations H8575 of God H0410 small H4592 with thee? is there any secret H0328 thing H1697 with thee?
015:012 Why doth thine heart H3820 carry thee away H3947 (8799)? and what do thy eyes H5869 wink at H7335 (8799),
015:013 That thou turnest H7725 (8686) thy spirit H7307 against God H0410, and lettest [such] words H4405 go out H3318 (8689) of thy mouth H6310?
015:014 What [is] man H0582, that he should be clean H2135 (8799)? and [he which is] born H3205 (8803) of a woman H0802, that he should be righteous H6663 (8799)?
015:015 Behold, he putteth no trust H0539 (8686) in his saints H6918; yea, the heavens H8064 are not clean H2141 (8804) in his sight H5869.
015:016 How much more abominable H8581 (8737) and filthy H0444 (8737) [is] man H0376, which drinketh H8354 (8802) iniquity H5766 (8675) H5766 like water H4325?
015:017 I will shew H2331 (8762) thee, hear H8085 (8798) me; and that [which] I have seen H2372 (8804) I will declare H5608 (8762);
015:018 Which wise H2450 men have told H5046 (8686) from their fathers H0001, and have not hid H3582 (8765) [it]:
015:019 Unto whom alone the earth H0776 was given H5414 (8738), and no stranger H2114 (8801) passed H5674 (8804) among H8432 them.
015:020 The wicked H7563 man travaileth H2342 (8711) with pain all [his] days H3117, and the number H4557 of years H8141 is hidden H6845 (8738) to the oppressor H6184.
015:021 A dreadful H6343 sound H6963 [is] in his ears H0241: in prosperity H7965 the destroyer H7703 (8802) shall come H0935 (8799) upon him.
015:022 He believeth H0539 (8686) not that he shall return H7725 (8800) out of darkness H2822, and he is waited H6822 (8803) for of the sword H2719.
015:023 He wandereth abroad H5074 (8802) for bread H3899, [saying], Where [is it]? he knoweth H3045 (8804) that the day H3117 of darkness H2822 is ready H3559 (8737) at his hand H3027.
015:024 Trouble H6862 and anguish H4691 shall make him afraid H1204 (8762); they shall prevail H8630 (8799) against him, as a king H4428 ready H6264 to the battle H3593.
015:025 For he stretcheth out H5186 (8804) his hand H3027 against God H0410, and strengtheneth H1396 (8691) himself against the Almighty H7706.
015:026 He runneth H7323 (8799) upon him, [even] on [his] neck H6677, upon the thick H5672 bosses H1354 of his bucklers H4043:
015:027 Because he covereth H3680 (8765) his face H6440 with his fatness H2459, and maketh H6213 (8799) collops of fat H6371 on [his] flanks H3689.
015:028 And he dwelleth H7931 (8799) in desolate H3582 (8737) cities H5892, [and] in houses H1004 which no man inhabiteth H3427 (8799), which are ready H6257 (8694) to become heaps H1530.
015:029 He shall not be rich H6238 (8799), neither shall his substance H2428 continue H6965 (8799), neither shall he prolong H5186 (8799) the perfection H4512 thereof upon the earth H0776.
015:030 He shall not depart H5493 (8799) out of darkness H2822; the flame H7957 shall dry up H3001 (8762) his branches H3127, and by the breath H7307 of his mouth H6310 shall he go away H5493 (8799).
015:031 Let not him that is deceived H8582 (8738) trust H0539 (8686) in vanity H7723: for vanity H7723 shall be his recompence H8545.
015:032 It shall be accomplished H4390 (8735) before H3808 his time H3117, and his branch H3712 shall not be green H7488.
015:033 He shall shake off H2554 (8799) his unripe grape H1154 as the vine H1612, and shall cast off H7993 (8686) his flower H5328 as the olive H2132.
015:034 For the congregation H5712 of hypocrites H2611 [shall be] desolate H1565, and fire H0784 shall consume H0398 (8804) the tabernacles H0168 of bribery H7810.
015:035 They conceive H2029 (8800) mischief H5999, and bring forth H3205 (8800) vanity H0205, and their belly H0990 prepareth H3559 (8686) deceit H4820.
016:001 ¶  Then Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
016:002 I have heard H8085 (8804) many such things H7227: miserable H5999 comforters H5162 (8764) [are] ye all.
016:003 Shall vain H7307 words H1697 have an end H7093? or what emboldeneth H4834 (8686) thee that thou answerest H6030 (8799)?
016:004 I also could speak H1696 (8762) as ye [do]: if H3863 your soul H5315 were H3426 in my soul’s H5315 stead, I could heap up H2266 (8686) words H4405 against you, and shake H5128 (8686) mine head H7218 at H1119 you.
016:005 [But] I would strengthen H0553 (8762) you with H1119 my mouth H6310, and the moving H5205 of my lips H8193 should asswage H2820 (8799) [your grief].
016:006 Though I speak H1696 (8762), my grief H3511 is not asswaged H2820 (8735): and [though] I forbear H2308 (8799), what am I eased H1980 (8799)?
016:007 But now he hath made me weary H3811 (8689): thou hast made desolate H8074 (8689) all my company H5712.
016:008 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles H7059 (8799), [which] is a witness H5707 [against me]: and my leanness H3585 rising up H6965 (8799) in me beareth witness H6030 (8799) to my face H6440.
016:009 He teareth H2963 (8804) [me] in his wrath H0639, who hateth H7852 (8799) me: he gnasheth H2786 (8804) upon me with his teeth H8127; mine enemy H6862 sharpeneth H3913 (8799) his eyes H5869 upon me.
016:010 They have gaped H6473 (8804) upon me with their mouth H6310; they have smitten H5221 (8689) me upon the cheek H3895 reproachfully H2781; they have gathered H4390 (8691) themselves together H3162 against me.
016:011 God H0410 hath delivered H5462 (8686) me to the ungodly H5760, and turned me over H3399 (8804) into the hands H3027 of the wicked H7563.
016:012 I was at ease H7961, but he hath broken me asunder H6565 (8770): he hath also taken H0270 (8804) [me] by my neck H6203, and shaken me to pieces H6327 (8770), and set me up H6965 (8686) for his mark H4307.
016:013 His archers H7228 compass me round about H5437 (8799), he cleaveth H6398 my reins H3629 asunder H6398 (8762), and doth not spare H2550 (8799); he poureth out H8210 (8799) my gall H4845 upon the ground H0776.
016:014 He breaketh H6555 (8799) me with breach H6556 upon H6440 breach H6556, he runneth H7323 (8799) upon me like a giant H1368.
016:015 I have sewed H8609 (8804) sackcloth H8242 upon my skin H1539, and defiled H5953 (8782) my horn H7161 in the dust H6083.
016:016 My face H6440 is foul H2560 (8777) with weeping H1065, and on my eyelids H6079 [is] the shadow of death H6757;
016:017 Not for [any] injustice H2555 in mine hands H3709: also my prayer H8605 [is] pure H2134.
016:018 O earth H0776, cover H3680 (8762) not thou my blood H1818, and let my cry H2201 have no place H4725.
016:019 Also now, behold, my witness H5707 [is] in heaven H8064, and my record H7717 [is] on high H4791.
016:020 My friends H7453 scorn H3887 (8688) me: [but] mine eye H5869 poureth out H1811 (8804) [tears] unto God H0433.
016:021 O that one might plead H3198 (8686) for a man H1397 with God H0433, as a man H0120 [pleadeth] for his neighbour H1121 H7453!
016:022 When a few H4557 years H8141 are come H0857 (8799), then I shall go H1980 (8799) the way H0734 [whence] I shall not return H7725 (8799).
017:001 ¶  My breath H7307 is corrupt H2254 (8795), my days H3117 are extinct H2193 (8738), the graves H6913 [are ready] for me.
017:002 [Are there] not mockers H2049 with me? and doth not mine eye H5869 continue H3885 (8799) in their provocation H4784 (8687)?
017:003 Lay down H7760 (8798) now, put me in a surety H6148 (8798) with thee; who [is] he [that] will strike H8628 (8735) hands H3027 with me?
017:004 For thou hast hid H6845 (8804) their heart H3820 from understanding H7922: therefore shalt thou not exalt H7311 (8787) [them].
017:005 He that speaketh H5046 (8686) flattery H2506 to [his] friends H7453, even the eyes H5869 of his children H1121 shall fail H3615 (8799).
017:006 He hath made H3322 (8689) me also a byword H4914 of the people H5971; and aforetime H6440 I was as a tabret H8611.
017:007 Mine eye H5869 also is dim H3543 (8799) by reason of sorrow H3708, and all my members H3338 [are] as a shadow H6738.
017:008 Upright H3477 [men] shall be astonied H8074 (8799) at this, and the innocent H5355 shall stir up H5782 (8709) himself against the hypocrite H2611.
017:009 The righteous H6662 also shall hold H0270 (8799) on his way H1870, and he that hath clean H2890 hands H3027 shall be H3254 (8686) stronger and stronger H0555.
017:010 But H0199 as for you all, do ye return H7725 (8799), and come now H0935 (8798): for I cannot find H4672 (8799) [one] wise H2450 [man] among you.
017:011 My days H3117 are past H5674 (8804), my purposes H2154 are broken off H5423 (8738), [even] the thoughts H4180 of my heart H3824.
017:012 They change H7760 (8799) the night H3915 into day H3117: the light H0216 [is] short H7138 because H6440 of darkness H2822.
017:013 If I wait H6960 (8762), the grave H7585 [is] mine house H1004: I have made H7502 (8765) my bed H3326 in the darkness H2822.
017:014 I have said H7121 (8804) to corruption H7845, Thou [art] my father H0001: to the worm H7415, [Thou art] my mother H0517, and my sister H0269.
017:015 And where [is] now H0645 my hope H8615? as for my hope H8615, who shall see H7789 (8799) it?
017:016 They shall go down H3381 (8799) to the bars H0905 of the pit H7585, when [our] rest H5183 together H3162 [is] in the dust H6083.
018:001 ¶  Then answered H6030 (8799) Bildad H1085 the Shuhite H7747, and said H0559 (8799),
018:002 How long H5704 [will it be ere] ye make H7760 (8799) an end H7078 of words H4405? mark H0995 (8799), and afterwards H0310 we will speak H1696 (8762).
018:003 Wherefore are we counted H2803 (8738) as beasts H0929, [and] reputed vile H2933 (8738) in your sight H5869?
018:004 He teareth H2963 (8802) himself H5315 in his anger H0639: shall the earth H0776 be forsaken H5800 (8735) for thee? and shall the rock H6697 be removed H6275 (8799) out of his place H4725?
018:005 Yea, the light H0216 of the wicked H7563 shall be put out H1846 (8799), and the spark H7632 of his fire H0784 shall not shine H5050 (8799).
018:006 The light H0216 shall be dark H2821 (8804) in his tabernacle H0168, and his candle H5216 shall be put out H1846 (8799) with him.
018:007 The steps H6806 of his strength H0202 shall be straitened H3334 (8799), and his own counsel H6098 shall cast him down H7993 (8686).
018:008 For he is cast H7971 (8795) into a net H7568 by his own feet H7272, and he walketh H1980 (8691) upon a snare H7639.
018:009 The gin H6341 shall take H0270 (8799) [him] by the heel H6119, [and] the robber H6782 shall prevail H2388 (8686) against him.
018:010 The snare H2256 [is] laid H2934 (8803) for him in the ground H0776, and a trap H4434 for him in the way H5410.
018:011 Terrors H1091 shall make him afraid H1204 (8765) on every side H5439, and shall drive H6327 (8689) him to his feet H7272.
018:012 His strength H0202 shall be hungerbitten H7457, and destruction H0343 [shall be] ready H3559 (8737) at his side H6763.
018:013 It shall devour H0398 (8799) the strength H0905 of his skin H5785: [even] the firstborn H1060 of death H4194 shall devour H0398 (8799) his strength H0905.
018:014 His confidence H4009 shall be rooted out H5423 (8735) of his tabernacle H0168, and it shall bring H6805 (8686) him to the king H4428 of terrors H1091.
018:015 It shall dwell H7931 (8799) in his tabernacle H0168, because [it is] none H1097 of his: brimstone H1614 shall be scattered H2219 (8792) upon his habitation H5116.
018:016 His roots H8328 shall be dried up H3001 (8799) beneath, and above H4605 shall his branch H7105 be cut off H5243 (8799).
018:017 His remembrance H2143 shall perish H0006 (8804) from the earth H0776, and he shall have no name H8034 in the street H6440 H2351.
018:018 He shall be driven H1920 (8799) from light H0216 into darkness H2822, and chased H5074 (8686) out of the world H8398.
018:019 He shall neither have son H5209 nor nephew H5220 among his people H5971, nor any remaining H8300 in his dwellings H4033.
018:020 They that come after H0314 [him] shall be astonied H8074 (8738) at his day H3117, as they that went before H6931 were affrighted H0270 (8804) H8178.
018:021 Surely such [are] the dwellings H4908 of the wicked H5767, and this [is] the place H4725 [of him that] knoweth H3045 (8804) not God H0410.
019:001 ¶  Then Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
019:002 How long will ye vex H3013 (8686) my soul H5315, and break H1792 (8762) me in pieces with words H4405?
019:003 These ten H6235 times H6471 have ye reproached H3637 (8686) me: ye are not ashamed H0954 (8799) [that] ye make yourselves strange H1970 (8686) to me.
019:004 And be it indeed H0551 [that] I have erred H7686 (8804), mine error H4879 remaineth H3885 (8799) with myself.
019:005 If indeed H0551 ye will magnify H1431 (8686) [yourselves] against me, and plead H3198 (8686) against me my reproach H2781:
019:006 Know H3045 (8798) now H0645 that God H0433 hath overthrown H5791 (8765) me, and hath compassed H5362 (8689) me with his net H4686.
019:007 Behold, I cry out H6817 (8799) of wrong H2555, but I am not heard H6030 (8735): I cry aloud H7768 (8762), but [there is] no judgment H4941.
019:008 He hath fenced up H1443 (8804) my way H0734 that I cannot pass H5674 (8799), and he hath set H7760 (8799) darkness H2822 in my paths H5410.
019:009 He hath stripped H6584 (8689) me of my glory H3519, and taken H5493 (8686) the crown H5850 [from] my head H7218.
019:010 He hath destroyed H5422 (8799) me on every side H5439, and I am gone H3212 (8799): and mine hope H8615 hath he removed H5265 (8686) like a tree H6086.
019:011 He hath also kindled H2734 (8686) his wrath H0639 against me, and he counteth H2803 (8799) me unto him as [one of] his enemies H6862.
019:012 His troops H1416 come H0935 (8799) together H3162, and raise up H5549 (8799) their way H1870 against me, and encamp H2583 (8799) round about H5439 my tabernacle H0168.
019:013 He hath put H7368 my brethren H0251 far H7368 (8689) from me, and mine acquaintance H3045 (8802) are verily estranged H2114 (8804) from me.
019:014 My kinsfolk H7138 have failed H2308 (8804), and my familiar friends H3045 (8794) have forgotten H7911 (8804) me.
019:015 They that dwell H1481 (8802) in mine house H1004, and my maids H0519, count H2803 (8799) me for a stranger H2114 (8801): I am an alien H5237 in their sight H5869.
019:016 I called H7121 (8804) my servant H5650, and he gave [me] no answer H6030 (8799); I intreated H2603 (8691) him with H1119 my mouth H6310.
019:017 My breath H7307 is strange H2114 (8804) to my wife H0802, though I intreated H2589 (8800) for the children’s H1121 [sake] of mine own body H0990.
019:018 Yea, young children H5759 despised H3988 (8804) me; I arose H6965 (8799), and they spake H1696 (8762) against me.
019:019 All my inward H5475 friends H4962 abhorred H8581 (8765) me: and they whom I loved H0157 (8804) are turned H2015 (8738) against me.
019:020 My bone H6106 cleaveth H1692 (8804) to my skin H5785 and to my flesh H1320, and I am escaped H4422 (8691) with the skin H5785 of my teeth H8127.
019:021 Have pity H2603 (8798) upon me, have pity H2603 (8798) upon me, O ye my friends H7453; for the hand H3027 of God H0433 hath touched H5060 (8804) me.
019:022 Why do ye persecute H7291 (8799) me as God H0410, and are not satisfied H7646 (8799) with my flesh H1320?
019:023 Oh that H5414 (8799) my words H4405 were now H0645 written H3789 (8735)! oh that H5414 (8799) they were printed H2710 (8714) in a book H5612!
019:024 That they were graven H2672 (8735) with an iron H1270 pen H5842 and lead H5777 in the rock H6697 for ever H5703!
019:025 For I know H3045 (8804) [that] my redeemer H1350 (8802) liveth H2416, and [that] he shall stand H6965 (8799) at the latter H0314 [day] upon the earth H6083:
019:026 And [though] after H0310 my skin H5785 [worms] destroy H5362 (8765) this [body], yet in my flesh H1320 shall I see H2372 (8799) God H0433:
019:027 Whom I shall see H2372 (8799) for myself, and mine eyes H5869 shall behold H7200 (8804), and not another H2114 (8801); [though] my reins H3629 be consumed H3615 (8804) within H2436 me.
019:028 But ye should say H0559 (8799), Why persecute H7291 (8799) we him, seeing the root H8328 of the matter H1697 is found H4672 (8738) in me?
019:029 Be ye afraid H1481 (8798) of the sword H2719: for wrath H2534 [bringeth] the punishments H5771 of H6440 the sword H2719, that ye may know H3045 (8799) [there is] a judgment H1779 (8675) H1779.
020:001 ¶  Then answered H6030 (8799) Zophar H6691 the Naamathite H5284, and said H0559 (8799),
020:002 Therefore do my thoughts H5587 cause me to answer H7725 (8686), and for [this] I make haste H2363 (8800).
020:003 I have heard H8085 (8799) the check H4148 of my reproach H3639, and the spirit H7307 of my understanding H0998 causeth me to answer H6030 (8799).
020:004 Knowest H3045 (8804) thou [not] this of old H5703, since man H0120 was placed H7760 (8800) upon earth H0776,
020:005 That the triumphing H7445 of the wicked H7563 [is] short H7138, and the joy H8057 of the hypocrite H2611 [but] for a moment H7281?
020:006 Though his excellency H7863 mount up H5927 (8799) to the heavens H8064, and his head H7218 reach H5060 (8686) unto the clouds H5645;
020:007 [Yet] he shall perish H0006 (8799) for ever H5331 like his own dung H1561: they which have seen H7200 (8802) him shall say H0559 (8799), Where H0335 [is] he?
020:008 He shall fly away H5774 (8799) as a dream H2472, and shall not be found H4672 (8799): yea, he shall be chased away H5074 (8714) as a vision H2384 of the night H3915.
020:009 The eye H5869 also [which] saw H7805 (8804) him shall [see him] no more H3254 (8686); neither shall his place H4725 any more behold H7789 (8799) him.
020:010 His children H1121 shall seek to please H7521 (8762) the poor H1800, and his hands H3027 shall restore H7725 (8686) their goods H0202.
020:011 His bones H6106 are full H4390 (8804) [of the sin] of his youth H5934, which shall lie down H7901 (8799) with him in the dust H6083.
020:012 Though wickedness H7451 be sweet H4985 (8686) in his mouth H6310, [though] he hide H3582 (8686) it under his tongue H3956;
020:013 [Though] he spare H2550 (8799) it, and forsake H5800 (8799) it not; but keep it still H4513 (8799) within H8432 his mouth H2441:
020:014 [Yet] his meat H3899 in his bowels H4578 is turned H2015 (8738), [it is] the gall H4846 of asps H6620 within H7130 him.
020:015 He hath swallowed down H1104 (8804) riches H2428, and he shall vomit them up again H6958 (8686): God H0410 shall cast them out H3423 (8686) of his belly H0990.
020:016 He shall suck H3243 (8799) the poison H7219 of asps H6620: the viper’s H0660 tongue H3956 shall slay H2026 (8799) him.
020:017 He shall not see H7200 (8799) the rivers H6390, the floods H5104, the brooks H5158 of honey H1706 and butter H2529.
020:018 That which he laboured H3022 for shall he restore H7725 (8688), and shall not swallow [it] down H1104 (8799): according to [his] substance H2428 [shall] the restitution H8545 [be], and he shall not rejoice H5965 (8799) [therein].
020:019 Because he hath oppressed H7533 (8765) [and] hath forsaken H5800 (8804) the poor H1800; [because] he hath violently taken away H1497 (8804) an house H1004 which he builded H1129 (8799) not;
020:020 Surely he shall not feel H3045 (8804) quietness H7961 in his belly H0990, he shall not save H4422 (8762) of that which he desired H2530 (8803).
020:021 There shall none of his meat H0400 be left H8300; therefore shall no man look H2342 (8799) for his goods H2898.
020:022 In the fulness H4390 (8800) (8675) H4390 (8763) of his sufficiency H5607 he shall be in straits H3334 (8799): every hand H3027 of the wicked H6001 shall come H0935 (8799) upon him.
020:023 [When] he is about to fill H4390 (8763) his belly H0990, [God] shall cast H7971 (8762) the fury H2740 of his wrath H0639 upon him, and shall rain H4305 (8686) [it] upon him while he is eating H3894.
020:024 He shall flee H1272 (8799) from the iron H1270 weapon H5402, [and] the bow H7198 of steel H5154 shall strike him through H2498 (8799).
020:025 It is drawn H8025 (8804), and cometh out H3318 (8799) of the body H1465; yea, the glittering sword H1300 cometh out H1980 (8799) of his gall H4846: terrors H0367 [are] upon him.
020:026 All darkness H2822 [shall be] hid H2934 (8803) in his secret places H6845 (8803): a fire H0784 not blown H5301 (8795) shall consume H0398 (8762) him; it shall go ill H3415 (8799) with him that is left H8300 in his tabernacle H0168.
020:027 The heaven H8064 shall reveal H1540 (8762) his iniquity H5771; and the earth H0776 shall rise up H6965 (8693) against him.
020:028 The increase H2981 of his house H1004 shall depart H1540 (8799), [and his goods] shall flow away H5064 (8737) in the day H3117 of his wrath H0639.
020:029 This [is] the portion H2506 of a wicked H7563 man H0120 from God H0430, and the heritage H5159 appointed H0561 unto him by God H0410.
021:001 ¶  But Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
021:002 Hear H8085 (8798) diligently H8085 (8800) my speech H4405, and let this be your consolations H8575.
021:003 Suffer H5375 (8798) me that I may speak H1696 (8762); and after H0310 that I have spoken H1696 (8763), mock on H3932 (8686).
021:004 As for me, [is] my complaint H7879 to man H0120? and if [it were so], why should not my spirit H7307 be troubled H7114 (8799)?
021:005 Mark H6437 (8798) me, and be astonished H8074 (8713), and lay H7760 (8798) [your] hand H3027 upon [your] mouth H6310.
021:006 Even when I remember H2142 (8804) I am afraid H0926 (8738), and trembling H6427 taketh hold on H0270 (8804) my flesh H1320.
021:007 Wherefore do the wicked H7563 live H2421 (8799), become old H6275 (8804), yea, are mighty H1396 (8804) in power H2428?
021:008 Their seed H2233 is established H3559 (8737) in their sight H6440 with them, and their offspring H6631 before their eyes H5869.
021:009 Their houses H1004 [are] safe H7965 from fear H6343, neither [is] the rod H7626 of God H0433 upon them.
021:010 Their bull H7794 gendereth H5674 (8765), and faileth H1602 (8686) not; their cow H6510 calveth H6403 (8762), and casteth not her calf H7921 (8762).
021:011 They send forth H7971 (8762) their little ones H5759 like a flock H6629, and their children H3206 dance H7540 (8762).
021:012 They take H5375 (8799) the timbrel H8596 and harp H3658, and rejoice H8055 (8799) at the sound H6963 of the organ H5748.
021:013 They spend H3615 (8762) (8675) H1086 (8762) their days H3117 in wealth H2896, and in a moment H7281 go down H2865 (8735) (8676) H5181 (8799) to the grave H7585.
021:014 Therefore they say H0559 (8799) unto God H0410, Depart H5493 (8798) from us; for we desire H2654 (8804) not the knowledge H1847 of thy ways H1870.
021:015 What [is] the Almighty H7706, that we should serve H5647 (8799) him? and what profit H3276 (8686) should we have, if we pray H6293 (8799) unto him?
021:016 Lo, their good H2898 [is] not in their hand H3027: the counsel H6098 of the wicked H7563 is far H7368 (8804) from me.
021:017 How oft is the candle H5216 of the wicked H7563 put out H1846 (8799)! and [how oft] cometh H0935 (8799) their destruction H0343 upon them! [God] distributeth H2505 (8762) sorrows H2256 in his anger H0639.
021:018 They are as stubble H8401 before H6440 the wind H7307, and as chaff H4671 that the storm H5492 carrieth away H1589 (8804).
021:019 God H0433 layeth up H6845 (8799) his iniquity H0205 for his children H1121: he rewardeth H7999 (8762) him, and he shall know H3045 (8799) [it].
021:020 His eyes H5869 shall see H7200 (8799) his destruction H3589, and he shall drink H8354 (8799) of the wrath H2534 of the Almighty H7706.
021:021 For what pleasure H2656 [hath] he in his house H1004 after H0310 him, when the number H4557 of his months H2320 is cut off in the midst H2686 (8795)?
021:022 Shall [any] teach H3925 (8762) God H0410 knowledge H1847? seeing he judgeth H8199 (8799) those that are high H7311 (8802).
021:023 One dieth H4191 (8799) in his full H8537 strength H6106, being wholly at ease H7946 and quiet H7961.
021:024 His breasts H5845 are full H4390 (8804) of milk H2461, and his bones H6106 are moistened H8248 (8792) with marrow H4221.
021:025 And another dieth H4191 (8799) in the bitterness H4751 of his soul H5315, and never eateth H0398 (8804) with pleasure H2896.
021:026 They shall lie down H7901 (8799) alike H3162 in the dust H6083, and the worms H7415 shall cover H3680 (8762) them.
021:027 Behold, I know H3045 (8804) your thoughts H4284, and the devices H4209 [which] ye wrongfully imagine H2554 (8799) against me.
021:028 For ye say H0559 (8799), Where [is] the house H1004 of the prince H5081? and where [are] the dwelling H4908 places H0168 of the wicked H7563?
021:029 Have ye not asked H7592 (8804) them that go H5674 (8802) by the way H1870? and do ye not know H5234 (8762) their tokens H0226,
021:030 That the wicked H7451 is reserved H2820 (8735) to the day H3117 of destruction H0343? they shall be brought forth H2986 (8714) to the day H3117 of wrath H5678.
021:031 Who shall declare H5046 (8686) his way H1870 to his face H6440? and who shall repay H7999 (8762) him [what] he hath done H6213 (8804)?
021:032 Yet shall he be brought H2986 (8714) to the grave H6913, and shall remain H8245 (8799) in the tomb H1430.
021:033 The clods H7263 of the valley H5158 shall be sweet H4985 (8804) unto him, and every man H0120 shall draw H4900 (8799) after H0310 him, as [there are] innumerable H4557 before H6440 him.
021:034 How then comfort H5162 (8762) ye me in vain H1892, seeing in your answers H8666 there remaineth H7604 (8738) falsehood H4604?
022:001 ¶  Then Eliphaz H0464 the Temanite H8489 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
022:002 Can a man H1397 be profitable H5532 (8799) unto God H0410, as H3588 he that is wise H7919 (8688) may be profitable H5532 (8799) unto himself?
022:003 [Is it] any pleasure H2656 to the Almighty H7706, that thou art righteous H6663 (8799)? or [is it] gain H1215 [to him], that thou makest thy ways H1870 perfect H8552 (8686)?
022:004 Will he reprove H3198 (8686) thee for fear H3374 of thee? will he enter H0935 (8799) with thee into judgment H4941?
022:005 [Is] not thy wickedness H7451 great H7227? and thine iniquities H5771 infinite H7093?
022:006 For thou hast taken a pledge H2254 (8799) from thy brother H0251 for nought H2600, and stripped H6584 (8686) the naked H6174 of their clothing H0899.
022:007 Thou hast not given water H4325 to the weary H5889 to drink H8248 (8686), and thou hast withholden H4513 (8799) bread H3899 from the hungry H7457.
022:008 But [as for] the mighty H2220 man H0376, he had the earth H0776; and the honourable man H5375 (8803) H6440 dwelt H3427 (8799) in it.
022:009 Thou hast sent H7971 (8765) widows H0490 away empty H7387, and the arms H2220 of the fatherless H3490 have been broken H1792 (8792).
022:010 Therefore snares H6341 [are] round about H5439 thee, and sudden H6597 fear H6343 troubleth H0926 (8762) thee;
022:011 Or darkness H2822, [that] thou canst not see H7200 (8799); and abundance H8229 of waters H4325 cover H3680 (8762) thee.
022:012 [Is] not God H0433 in the height H1363 of heaven H8064? and behold H7200 (8798) the height H7218 of the stars H3556, how high H7311 (8804) they are!
022:013 And thou sayest H0559 (8804), How doth God H0410 know H3045 (8804)? can he judge H8199 (8799) through the dark cloud H6205?
022:014 Thick clouds H5645 [are] a covering H5643 to him, that he seeth H7200 (8799) not; and he walketh H1980 (8691) in the circuit H2329 of heaven H8064.
022:015 Hast thou marked H8104 (8799) the old H5769 way H0734 which wicked H0205 men H4962 have trodden H1869 (8804)?
022:016 Which were cut down H7059 (8795) out of time H6256, whose foundation H3247 was overflown H3332 (8714) with a flood H5104:
022:017 Which said H0559 (8802) unto God H0410, Depart H5493 (8798) from us: and what can the Almighty H7706 do H6466 (8799) for them?
022:018 Yet he filled H4390 (8765) their houses H1004 with good H2896 [things]: but the counsel H6098 of the wicked H7563 is far H7368 (8804) from me.
022:019 The righteous H6662 see H7200 (8799) [it], and are glad H8055 (8799): and the innocent H5355 laugh them to scorn H3932 (8799).
022:020 Whereas H0518 our substance H7009 is not cut down H3582 (8738), but the remnant H3499 of them the fire H0784 consumeth H0398 (8804).
022:021 Acquaint H5532 (8685) now thyself with him, and be at peace H7999 (8798): thereby good H2896 shall come H0935 (8799) unto thee.
022:022 Receive H3947 (8798), I pray thee, the law H8451 from his mouth H6310, and lay up H7760 (8798) his words H0561 in thine heart H3824.
022:023 If thou return H7725 (8799) to the Almighty H7706, thou shalt be built up H1129 (8735), thou shalt put away H7368 iniquity H5766 far H7368 (8686) from thy tabernacles H0168.
022:024 Then shalt thou lay up H7896 (8800) gold H1220 as H5921 dust H6083, and the [gold] of Ophir H0211 as the stones H6697 of the brooks H5158.
022:025 Yea, the Almighty H7706 shall be thy defence H1220, and thou shalt have plenty H8443 of silver H3701.
022:026 For then shalt thou have thy delight H6026 (8691) in the Almighty H7706, and shalt lift up H5375 (8799) thy face H6440 unto God H0433.
022:027 Thou shalt make thy prayer H6279 (8686) unto him, and he shall hear H8085 (8799) thee, and thou shalt pay H7999 (8762) thy vows H5088.
022:028 Thou shalt also decree H1504 (8799) a thing H0562, and it shall be established H6965 (8799) unto thee: and the light H0216 shall shine H5050 (8804) upon thy ways H1870.
022:029 When [men] are cast down H8213 (8689), then thou shalt say H0559 (8799), [There is] lifting up H1466; and he shall save H3467 (8686) the humble H7807 person H5869.
022:030 He shall deliver H4422 (8762) the island H0336 of the innocent H5355: and it is delivered H4422 (8738) by the pureness H1252 of thine hands H3709.
023:001 ¶  Then Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
023:002 Even to day H3117 [is] my complaint H7879 bitter H4805: my stroke H3027 is heavier H3513 (8804) than my groaning H0585.
023:003 Oh that H5414 (8799) I knew H3045 (8804) where I might find H4672 (8799) him! [that] I might come H0935 (8799) [even] to his seat H8499!
023:004 I would order H6186 (8799) [my] cause H4941 before H6440 him, and fill H4390 (8762) my mouth H6310 with arguments H8433.
023:005 I would know H3045 (8799) the words H4405 [which] he would answer H6030 (8799) me, and understand H0995 (8799) what he would say H0559 (8799) unto me.
023:006 Will he plead H7378 (8799) against H5978 me with [his] great H7230 power H3581? No; but he would put H7760 (8799) [strength] in me.
023:007 There the righteous H3477 might dispute H3198 (8737) with him; so should I be delivered H6403 (8762) for ever H5331 from my judge H8199 (8802).
023:008 Behold, I go H1980 (8799) forward H6924, but he [is] not [there]; and backward H0268, but I cannot perceive H0995 (8799) him:
023:009 On the left hand H8040, where he doth work H6213 (8800), but I cannot behold H2372 (8799) [him]: he hideth H5848 (8799) himself on the right hand H3225, that I cannot see H7200 (8799) [him]:
023:010 But he knoweth H3045 (8804) the way H1870 that I take H5978: [when] he hath tried H0974 (8804) me, I shall come forth H3318 (8799) as gold H2091.
023:011 My foot H7272 hath held H0270 (8804) his steps H0838, his way H1870 have I kept H8104 (8804), and not declined H5186 (8686).
023:012 Neither have I gone back H4185 (8686) from the commandment H4687 of his lips H8193; I have esteemed H6845 (8804) the words H0561 of his mouth H6310 more than my necessary H2706 [food].
023:013 But he [is] in one H0259 [mind], and who can turn H7725 (8686) him? and [what] his soul H5315 desireth H0183 (8765), even [that] he doeth H6213 (8799).
023:014 For he performeth H7999 (8686) [the thing that is] appointed H2706 for me: and many H7227 such H2007 [things are] with him.
023:015 Therefore am I troubled H0926 (8735) at his presence H6440: when I consider H0995 (8709), I am afraid H6342 (8799) of him.
023:016 For God H0410 maketh my heart H3820 soft H7401 (8689), and the Almighty H7706 troubleth H0926 (8689) me:
023:017 Because I was not cut off H6789 (8738) before H6440 the darkness H2822, [neither] hath he covered H3680 (8765) the darkness H0652 from my face H6440.
024:001 ¶  Why, seeing times H6256 are not hidden H6845 (8738) from the Almighty H7706, do they that know H3045 (8802) him not see H2372 (8804) his days H3117?
024:002 [Some] remove H5381 (8686) the landmarks H1367; they violently take away H1497 (8804) flocks H5739, and feed H7462 (8799) [thereof].
024:003 They drive away H5090 (8799) the ass H2543 of the fatherless H3490, they take H2254 the widow’s H0490 ox H7794 for a pledge H2254 (8799).
024:004 They turn H5186 (8686) the needy H0034 out of the way H1870: the poor H6041 (8675) H6035 of the earth H0776 hide H2244 (8795) themselves together H3162.
024:005 Behold, [as] wild asses H6501 in the desert H4057, go they forth H3318 (8804) to their work H6467; rising betimes H7836 (8764) for a prey H2964: the wilderness H6160 [yieldeth] food H3899 for them [and] for [their] children H5288.
024:006 They reap H7114 (8799) (8675) H7114 (8686) [every one] his corn H1098 in the field H7704: and they gather H3953 (8762) the vintage H3754 of the wicked H7563.
024:007 They cause the naked H6174 to lodge H3885 (8686) without clothing H3830, that [they have] no covering H3682 in the cold H7135.
024:008 They are wet H7372 (8799) with the showers H2230 of the mountains H2022, and embrace H2263 (8765) the rock H6697 for want of a shelter H4268.
024:009 They pluck H1497 (8799) the fatherless H3490 from the breast H7699, and take a pledge H2254 (8799) of the poor H6041.
024:010 They cause [him] to go H1980 (8765) naked H6174 without clothing H3830, and they take away H5375 (8804) the sheaf H6016 [from] the hungry H7457;
024:011 [Which] make oil H6671 (8686) within H0996 their walls H7791, [and] tread H1869 (8804) [their] winepresses H3342, and suffer thirst H6770 (8799).
024:012 Men H4962 groan H5008 (8799) from out of the city H5892, and the soul H5315 of the wounded H2491 crieth out H7768 (8762): yet God H0433 layeth H7760 (8799) not folly H8604 [to them].
024:013 They are of those that rebel H4775 (8802) against the light H0216; they know H5234 (8689) not the ways H1870 thereof, nor abide H3427 (8804) in the paths H5410 thereof.
024:014 The murderer H7523 (8802) rising H6965 (8799) with the light H0216 killeth H6991 (8799) the poor H6041 and needy H0034, and in the night H3915 is as a thief H1590.
024:015 The eye H5869 also of the adulterer H5003 (8802) waiteth H8104 (8804) for the twilight H5399, saying H0559 (8800), No eye H5869 shall see H7789 (8799) me: and disguiseth H5643 H7760 (8799) [his] face H6440.
024:016 In the dark H2822 they dig through H2864 (8804) houses H1004, [which] they had marked H2856 (8765) for themselves in the daytime H3119: they know H3045 (8804) not the light H0216.
024:017 For the morning H1242 [is] to them even as H3162 the shadow of death H6757: if [one] know H5234 (8686) [them, they are in] the terrors H1091 of the shadow of death H6757.
024:018 He [is] swift H7031 as the waters H6440 H4325; their portion H2513 is cursed H7043 (8792) in the earth H0776: he beholdeth H6437 (8799) not the way H1870 of the vineyards H3754.
024:019 Drought H6723 and heat H2527 consume H1497 (8799) the snow H7950 waters H4325: [so doth] the grave H7585 [those which] have sinned H2398 (8804).
024:020 The womb H7358 shall forget H7911 (8799) him; the worm H7415 shall feed sweetly H4988 (8804) on him; he shall be no more remembered H2142 (8735); and wickedness H5766 shall be broken H7665 (8735) as a tree H6086.
024:021 He evil entreateth H7462 (8802) the barren H6135 [that] beareth H3205 (8799) not: and doeth not good H3190 (8686) to the widow H0490.
024:022 He draweth H4900 (8804) also the mighty H0047 with his power H3581: he riseth up H6965 (8799), and no [man] is sure H0539 (8686) of life H2416.
024:023 [Though] it be given H5414 (8799) him [to be] in safety H0983, whereon he resteth H8172 (8735); yet his eyes H5869 [are] upon their ways H1870.
024:024 They are exalted H7426 (8804) for a little while H4592, but are gone and brought low H4355 (8717); they are taken out H7092 (8735) of the way H1870 as all [other], and cut off H5243 (8799) as the tops H7218 of the ears of corn H7641.
024:025 And if [it be] not [so] now H0645, who will make H7760 (8799) me a liar H3576 (8686), and make H7760 (8799) my speech H4405 nothing worth H0408?
025:001 ¶  Then answered H6030 (8799) Bildad H1085 the Shuhite H7747, and said H0559 (8799),
025:002 Dominion H4910 (8687) and fear H6343 [are] with him, he maketh H6213 (8802) peace H7965 in his high places H4791.
025:003 Is there H3426 any number H4557 of his armies H1416? and upon whom doth not his light H0216 arise H6965 (8799)?
025:004 How then can man H0582 be justified H6663 (8799) with God H0410? or how can he be clean H2135 (8799) [that is] born H3205 (8803) of a woman H0802?
025:005 Behold even to the moon H3394, and it shineth H0166 (8686) not; yea, the stars H3556 are not pure H2141 (8804) in his sight H5869.
025:006 How much less man H0582, [that is] a worm H7415? and the son H1121 of man H0120, [which is] a worm H8438?
026:001 ¶  But Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
026:002 How hast thou helped H5826 (8804) [him that is] without power H3581? [how] savest H3467 (8689) thou the arm H2220 [that hath] no H3808 strength H5797?
026:003 How hast thou counselled H3289 (8804) [him that hath] no H3808 wisdom H2451? and [how] hast thou plentifully H7230 declared H3045 (8689) the thing as it is H8454?
026:004 To whom hast thou uttered H5046 (8689) words H4405? and whose spirit H5397 came H3318 (8804) from thee?
026:005 Dead H7496 [things] are formed H2342 (8787) from under the waters H4325, and the inhabitants H7931 (8802) thereof.
026:006 Hell H7585 [is] naked H6174 before him, and destruction H0011 hath no covering H3682.
026:007 He stretcheth out H5186 (8802) the north H6828 over the empty place H8414, [and] hangeth H8518 (8802) the earth H0776 upon nothing H1099.
026:008 He bindeth up H6887 (8802) the waters H4325 in his thick clouds H5645; and the cloud H6051 is not rent H1234 (8738) under them.
026:009 He holdeth back H0270 (8764) the face H6440 of his throne H3678, [and] spreadeth H6576 (8768) his cloud H6051 upon it.
026:010 He hath compassed H2328 (8804) the waters H6440 H4325 with bounds H2706, until the day H0216 and night H2822 come to an end H8503.
026:011 The pillars H5982 of heaven H8064 tremble H7322 (8787) and are astonished H8539 (8799) at his reproof H1606.
026:012 He divideth H7280 (8804) the sea H3220 with his power H3581, and by his understanding H8394 (8675) H8394 he smiteth H4272 (8804) through the proud H7293.
026:013 By his spirit H7307 he hath garnished H8235 (8765) the heavens H8064; his hand H3027 hath formed H2342 (8790) the crooked H1281 serpent H5175.
026:014 Lo, these [are] parts H7098 of his ways H1870: but how little H8102 a portion H1697 is heard H8085 (8738) of him? but the thunder H7482 of his power H1369 who can understand H0995 (8709)?
027:001 ¶  Moreover Job H0347 continued H3254 (8686) H5375 (8800) his parable H4912, and said H0559 (8799),
027:002 [As] God H0410 liveth H2416, [who] hath taken away H5493 (8689) my judgment H4941; and the Almighty H7706, [who] hath vexed H4843 (8689) my soul H5315;
027:003 All the while H5750 my breath H5397 [is] in me, and the spirit H7307 of God H0433 [is] in my nostrils H0639;
027:004 My lips H8193 shall not speak H1696 (8762) wickedness H5766, nor my tongue H3956 utter H1897 (8799) deceit H7423.
027:005 God forbid H2486 that I should justify H6663 (8686) you: till I die H1478 (8799) I will not remove H5493 (8686) mine integrity H8538 from me.
027:006 My righteousness H6666 I hold H2388 (8689) fast, and will not let it go H7503 (8686): my heart H3824 shall not reproach H2778 (8799) [me] so long as I live H3117.
027:007 Let mine enemy H0341 (8802) be as the wicked H7563, and he that riseth up H6965 (8693) against me as the unrighteous H5767.
027:008 For what [is] the hope H8615 of the hypocrite H2611, though he hath gained H1214 (8799), when God H0433 taketh away H7953 (8799) his soul H5315?
027:009 Will God H0410 hear H8085 (8799) his cry H6818 when trouble H6869 cometh H0935 (8799) upon him?
027:010 Will he delight H6026 (8691) himself in the Almighty H7706? will he always H6256 call H7121 (8799) upon God H0433?
027:011 I will teach H3384 (8686) you by the hand H3027 of God H0410: [that] which [is] with the Almighty H7706 will I not conceal H3582 (8762).
027:012 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen H2372 (8804) [it]; why then are ye thus altogether H1892 vain H1891 (8799)?
027:013 This [is] the portion H2506 of a wicked H7563 man H0120 with God H0410, and the heritage H5159 of oppressors H6184, [which] they shall receive H3947 (8799) of the Almighty H7706.
027:014 If his children H1121 be multiplied H7235 (8799), [it is] for H3926 the sword H2719: and his offspring H6631 shall not be satisfied H7646 (8799) with bread H3899.
027:015 Those that remain H8300 of him shall be buried H6912 (8735) in death H4194: and his widows H0490 shall not weep H1058 (8799).
027:016 Though he heap up H6651 (8799) silver H3701 as the dust H6083, and prepare H3559 (8686) raiment H4403 as the clay H2563;
027:017 He may prepare H3559 (8686) [it], but the just H6662 shall put [it] on H3847 (8799), and the innocent H5355 shall divide H2505 (8799) the silver H3701.
027:018 He buildeth H1129 (8804) his house H1004 as a moth H6211, and as a booth H5521 [that] the keeper H5341 (8802) maketh H6213 (8804).
027:019 The rich H6223 man shall lie down H7901 (8799), but he shall not be gathered H0622 (8735): he openeth H6491 (8804) his eyes H5869, and he [is] not.
027:020 Terrors H1091 take hold H5381 (8686) on him as waters H4325, a tempest H5492 stealeth him away H1589 (8804) in the night H3915.
027:021 The east H6921 wind carrieth him away H5375 (8799), and he departeth H3212 (8799): and as a storm hurleth H8175 (8762) him out of his place H4725.
027:022 For [God] shall cast H7993 (8686) upon him, and not spare H2550 (8799): he would fain H1272 (8800) flee H1272 (8799) out of his hand H3027.
027:023 [Men] shall clap H5606 (8799) their hands H3709 at him, and shall hiss H8319 (8799) him out of his place H4725.
028:001 ¶  Surely H3426 there is a vein H4161 for the silver H3701, and a place H4725 for gold H2091 [where] they fine H2212 (8799) [it].
028:002 Iron H1270 is taken H3947 (8714) out of the earth H6083, and brass H5154 [is] molten H6694 (8799) [out of] the stone H0068.
028:003 He setteth H7760 (8804) an end H7093 to darkness H2822, and searcheth out H2713 (8802) all perfection H8503: the stones H0068 of darkness H0652, and the shadow of death H6757.
028:004 The flood H5158 breaketh out H6555 (8804) from the inhabitant H1481 (8802); [even the waters] forgotten H7911 (8737) of the foot H7272: they are dried up H1809 (8804), they are gone away H5128 (8804) from men H0582.
028:005 [As for] the earth H0776, out of it cometh H3318 (8799) bread H3899: and under it is turned up H2015 (8738) as it were fire H0784.
028:006 The stones H0068 of it [are] the place H4725 of sapphires H5601: and it hath dust H6083 of gold H2091.
028:007 [There is] a path H5410 which no fowl H5861 knoweth H3045 (8804), and which the vulture’s H0344 eye H5869 hath not seen H7805 (8804):
028:008 The lion’s H7830 whelps H1121 have not trodden H1869 (8689) it, nor the fierce lion H7826 passed H5710 (8804) by it.
028:009 He putteth forth H7971 (8804) his hand H3027 upon the rock H2496; he overturneth H2015 (8804) the mountains H2022 by the roots H8328.
028:010 He cutteth out H1234 (8765) rivers H2975 among the rocks H6697; and his eye H5869 seeth H7200 (8804) every precious thing H3366.
028:011 He bindeth H2280 (8765) the floods H5104 from overflowing H1065; and [the thing that is] hid H8587 bringeth he forth H3318 (8686) to light H0216.
028:012 But where H0370 shall wisdom H2451 be found H4672 (8735)? and where [is] the place H4725 of understanding H0998?
028:013 Man H0582 knoweth H3045 (8804) not the price H6187 thereof; neither is it found H4672 (8735) in the land H0776 of the living H2416.
028:014 The depth H8415 saith H0559 (8804), It [is] not in me: and the sea H3220 saith H0559 (8804), [It is] not with me.
028:015 It cannot be gotten H5414 (8714) for gold H5458, neither shall silver H3701 be weighed H8254 (8735) [for] the price H4242 thereof.
028:016 It cannot be valued H5541 (8792) with the gold H3800 of Ophir H0211, with the precious H3368 onyx H7718, or the sapphire H5601.
028:017 The gold H2091 and the crystal H2137 cannot equal H6186 (8799) it: and the exchange H8545 of it [shall not be for] jewels H3627 of fine gold H6337.
028:018 No mention H2142 (8735) shall be made of coral H7215, or of pearls H1378: for the price H4901 of wisdom H2451 [is] above rubies H6443.
028:019 The topaz H6357 of Ethiopia H3568 shall not equal H6186 (8799) it, neither shall it be valued H5541 (8792) with pure H2889 gold H3800.
028:020 Whence H0370 then cometh H0935 (8799) wisdom H2451? and where [is] the place H4725 of understanding H0998?
028:021 Seeing it is hid H5956 (8738) from the eyes H5869 of all living H2416, and kept close H5641 (8738) from the fowls H5775 of the air H8064.
028:022 Destruction H0011 and death H4194 say H0559 (8804), We have heard H8085 (8804) the fame H8088 thereof with our ears H0241.
028:023 God H0430 understandeth H0995 (8689) the way H1870 thereof, and he knoweth H3045 (8804) the place H4725 thereof.
028:024 For he looketh H5027 (8686) to the ends H7098 of the earth H0776, [and] seeth H7200 (8799) under the whole heaven H8064;
028:025 To make H6213 (8800) the weight H4948 for the winds H7307; and he weigheth H8505 (8765) the waters H4325 by measure H4060.
028:026 When he made H6213 (8800) a decree H2706 for the rain H4306, and a way H1870 for the lightning H2385 of the thunder H6963:
028:027 Then did he see H7200 (8804) it, and declare H5608 (8762) it; he prepared H3559 (8689) it, yea, and searched it out H2713 (8804).
028:028 And unto man H0120 he said H0559 (8799), Behold, the fear H3374 of the Lord H0136, that [is] wisdom H2451; and to depart H5493 (8800) from evil H7451 [is] understanding H0998.
029:001 ¶  Moreover Job H0347 continued H3254 (8686) H5375 (8800) his parable H4912, and said H0559 (8799),
029:002 Oh that H5414 (8799) I were as [in] months H3391 past H6924, as [in] the days H3117 [when] God H0433 preserved H8104 (8799) me;
029:003 When his candle H5216 shined H1984 (8800) upon my head H7218, [and when] by his light H0216 I walked H3212 (8799) [through] darkness H2822;
029:004 As I was in the days H3117 of my youth H2779, when the secret H5475 of God H0433 [was] upon my tabernacle H0168;
029:005 When the Almighty H7706 [was] yet with me, [when] my children H5288 [were] about H5439 me;
029:006 When I washed H7364 (8800) my steps H1978 with butter H2529, and the rock H6697 poured me out H6694 (8799) rivers H6388 of oil H8081;
029:007 When I went out H3318 (8800) to the gate H8179 through the city H7176, [when] I prepared H3559 (8686) my seat H4186 in the street H7339!
029:008 The young men H5288 saw H7200 (8804) me, and hid H2244 (8738) themselves: and the aged H3453 arose H6965 (8804), [and] stood up H5975 (8804).
029:009 The princes H8269 refrained H6113 (8804) talking H4405, and laid H7760 (8799) [their] hand H3709 on their mouth H6310.
029:010 The nobles H5057 held H2244 (8738) their peace H6963, and their tongue H3956 cleaved H1692 (8804) to the roof of their mouth H2441.
029:011 When the ear H0241 heard H8085 (8804) [me], then it blessed H0833 (8762) me; and when the eye H5869 saw H7200 (8804) [me], it gave witness H5749 (8686) to me:
029:012 Because I delivered H4422 (8762) the poor H6041 that cried H7768 (8764), and the fatherless H3490, and [him that had] none to help H5826 (8802) him.
029:013 The blessing H1293 of him that was ready to perish H0006 (8802) came H0935 (8799) upon me: and I caused the widow’s H0490 heart H3820 to sing for joy H7442 (8686).
029:014 I put H3847 (8804) on righteousness H6664, and it clothed H3847 (8799) me: my judgment H4941 [was] as a robe H4598 and a diadem H6797.
029:015 I was eyes H5869 to the blind H5787, and feet H7272 [was] I to the lame H6455.
029:016 I [was] a father H0001 to the poor H0034: and the cause H7379 [which] I knew H3045 (8804) not I searched out H2713 (8799).
029:017 And I brake H7665 (8762) the jaws H4973 of the wicked H5767, and plucked H7993 (8686) the spoil H2964 out of his teeth H8127.
029:018 Then I said H0559 (8799), I shall die H1478 (8799) in my nest H7064, and I shall multiply H7235 (8686) [my] days H3117 as the sand H2344.
029:019 My root H8328 [was] spread out H6605 (8803) by the waters H4325, and the dew H2919 lay all night H3885 (8799) upon my branch H7105.
029:020 My glory H3519 [was] fresh H2319 in me H5978, and my bow H7198 was renewed H2498 (8686) in my hand H3027.
029:021 Unto me [men] gave ear H8085 (8804), and waited H3176 (8765), and kept silence H1826 (8799) at H3926 my counsel H6098.
029:022 After H0310 my words H1697 they spake not again H8138 (8799); and my speech H4405 dropped H5197 (8799) upon them.
029:023 And they waited H3176 (8765) for me as for the rain H4306; and they opened H6473 (8804) their mouth H6310 wide [as] for the latter rain H4456.
029:024 [If] I laughed H7832 (8799) on them, they believed H0539 (8686) [it] not; and the light H0216 of my countenance H6440 they cast not down H5307 (8686).
029:025 I chose H0977 (8799) out their way H1870, and sat H3427 (8799) chief H7218, and dwelt H7931 (8799) as a king H4428 in the army H1416, as one [that] comforteth H5162 (8762) the mourners H0057.
030:001 ¶  But now [they that are] younger H6810 H3117 than I have me in derision H7832 (8804), whose fathers H0001 I would have disdained H3988 (8804) to have set H7896 (8800) with the dogs H3611 of my flock H6629.
030:002 Yea, whereto H4100 [might] the strength H3581 of their hands H3027 [profit] me, in whom old age H3624 was perished H0006 (8804)?
030:003 For want H2639 and famine H3720 [they were] solitary H1565; fleeing H6207 (8802) into the wilderness H6723 in former time H0570 desolate H7722 and waste H4875.
030:004 Who cut up H6998 (8801) mallows H4408 by the bushes H7880, and juniper H7574 roots H8328 [for] their meat H3899.
030:005 They were driven forth H1644 (8792) from among H1460 [men], (they cried H7321 (8686) after them as [after] a thief H1590;)
030:006 To dwell H7931 (8800) in the clifts H6178 of the valleys H5158, [in] caves H2356 of the earth H6083, and [in] the rocks H3710.
030:007 Among the bushes H7880 they brayed H5101 (8799); under the nettles H2738 they were gathered together H5596 (8792).
030:008 [They were] children H1121 of fools H5036, yea, children H1121 of base men H8034: they were viler H5217 (8738) than the earth H0776.
030:009 And now am I their song H5058, yea, I am their byword H4405.
030:010 They abhor H8581 (8765) me, they flee far H7368 (8804) from me, and spare H2820 (8804) not to spit H7536 in my face H6440.
030:011 Because he hath loosed H6605 (8765) my cord H3499, and afflicted H6031 (8762) me, they have also let loose H7971 (8765) the bridle H7448 before H6440 me.
030:012 Upon [my] right H3225 [hand] rise H6965 (8799) the youth H6526; they push away H7971 (8765) my feet H7272, and they raise up H5549 (8799) against me the ways H0734 of their destruction H0343.
030:013 They mar H5420 (8804) my path H5410, they set forward H3276 (8686) my calamity H1942 (8675) H1962, they have no helper H5826 (8802).
030:014 They came H0857 (8799) [upon me] as a wide H7342 breaking H6556 in [of waters]: in H8478 the desolation H7722 they rolled H1556 (8701) themselves [upon me].
030:015 Terrors H1091 are turned H2015 (8717) upon me: they pursue H7291 (8799) my soul H5082 as the wind H7307: and my welfare H3444 passeth away H5674 (8804) as a cloud H5645.
030:016 And now my soul H5315 is poured out H8210 (8691) upon me; the days H3117 of affliction H6040 have taken hold H0270 (8799) upon me.
030:017 My bones H6106 are pierced H5365 (8765) in me in the night season H3915: and my sinews H6207 (8802) take no rest H7901 (8799).
030:018 By the great H7230 force H3581 [of my disease] is my garment H3830 changed H2664 (8691): it bindeth me about H0247 (8799) as the collar H6310 of my coat H3801.
030:019 He hath cast H3384 (8689) me into the mire H2563, and I am become like H4911 (8691) dust H6083 and ashes H0665.
030:020 I cry H7768 (8762) unto thee, and thou dost not hear H6030 (8799) me: I stand up H5975 (8804), and thou regardest H0995 (8709) me [not].
030:021 Thou art become H2015 (8735) cruel H0393 to me: with thy strong H6108 hand H3027 thou opposest H7852 (8799) thyself against me.
030:022 Thou liftest me up H5375 (8799) to the wind H7307; thou causest me to ride H7392 (8686) [upon it], and dissolvest H4127 (8787) my substance H8454 (8675) H7738 (8762).
030:023 For I know H3045 (8804) [that] thou wilt bring H7725 (8686) me [to] death H4194, and [to] the house H1004 appointed H4150 for all living H2416.
030:024 Howbeit he will not stretch out H7971 (8799) [his] hand H3027 to the grave H1164, though they cry H7769 in his destruction H6365.
030:025 Did not I weep H1058 (8804) for him that was in trouble H7186 H3117? was [not] my soul H5315 grieved H5701 (8804) for the poor H0034?
030:026 When I looked H6960 (8765) for good H2896, then evil H7451 came H0935 (8799) [unto me]: and when I waited H3176 (8762) for light H0216, there came H0935 (8799) darkness H0652.
030:027 My bowels H4578 boiled H7570 (8795), and rested H1826 (8804) not: the days H3117 of affliction H6040 prevented H6923 (8765) me.
030:028 I went H1980 (8765) mourning H6937 (8802) without the sun H2535: I stood up H6965 (8804), [and] I cried H7768 (8762) in the congregation H6951.
030:029 I am a brother H0251 to dragons H8577, and a companion H7453 to owls H1323 H3284.
030:030 My skin H5785 is black H7835 (8804) upon me, and my bones H6106 are burned H2787 (8804) with heat H2721.
030:031 My harp H3658 also is [turned] to mourning H0060, and my organ H5748 into the voice H6963 of them that weep H1058 (8802).
031:001 ¶  I made H3772 (8804) a covenant H1285 with mine eyes H5869; why then should I think H0995 (8709) upon a maid H1330?
031:002 For what portion H2506 of God H0433 [is there] from above H4605? and [what] inheritance H5159 of the Almighty H7706 from on high H4791?
031:003 [Is] not destruction H0343 to the wicked H5767? and a strange H5235 [punishment] to the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205?
031:004 Doth not he see H7200 (8799) my ways H1870, and count H5608 (8799) all my steps H6806?
031:005 If I have walked H1980 (8804) with vanity H7723, or if my foot H7272 hath hasted H2363 (8799) to deceit H4820;
031:006 Let me be weighed H8254 (8799) in an even H6664 balance H3976, that God H0433 may know H3045 (8799) mine integrity H8538.
031:007 If my step H0838 hath turned out H5186 (8799) of the way H1870, and mine heart H3820 walked H1980 (8804) after H0310 mine eyes H5869, and if any blot H3971 hath cleaved H1692 (8804) to mine hands H3709;
031:008 [Then] let me sow H2232 (8799), and let another H0312 eat H0398 (8799); yea, let my offspring H6631 be rooted out H8327 (8792).
031:009 If mine heart H3820 have been deceived H6601 (8738) by a woman H0802, or [if] I have laid wait H0693 (8804) at my neighbour’s H7453 door H6607;
031:010 [Then] let my wife H0802 grind H2912 (8799) unto another H0312, and let others H0312 bow down H3766 (8799) upon her.
031:011 For this [is] an heinous crime H2154; yea, it [is] an iniquity H5771 [to be punished by] the judges H6414.
031:012 For it [is] a fire H0784 [that] consumeth H0398 (8799) to destruction H0011, and would root out H8327 (8762) all mine increase H8393.
031:013 If I did despise H3988 (8799) the cause H4941 of my manservant H5650 or of my maidservant H0519, when they contended H7379 with me;
031:014 What then shall I do H6213 (8799) when God H0410 riseth up H6965 (8799)? and when he visiteth H6485 (8799), what shall I answer H7725 (8686) him?
031:015 Did not he that made H6213 (8802) me in the womb H0990 make H6213 (8804) him? and did not one H0259 fashion H3559 (8787) us in the womb H7358?
031:016 If I have withheld H4513 (8799) the poor H1800 from [their] desire H2656, or have caused the eyes H5869 of the widow H0490 to fail H3615 (8762);
031:017 Or have eaten H0398 (8799) my morsel H6595 myself alone, and the fatherless H3490 hath not eaten H0398 (8804) thereof;
031:018 (For from my youth H5271 he was brought up H1431 (8804) with me, as [with] a father H0001, and I have guided H5148 (8686) her from my mother’s H0517 womb H0990;)
031:019 If I have seen H7200 (8799) any perish H0006 (8802) for want of clothing H3830, or any poor H0034 without covering H3682;
031:020 If his loins H2504 have not blessed H1288 (8765) me, and [if] he were [not] warmed H2552 (8691) with the fleece H1488 of my sheep H3532;
031:021 If I have lifted up H5130 (8689) my hand H3027 against the fatherless H3490, when I saw H7200 (8799) my help H5833 in the gate H8179:
031:022 [Then] let mine arm H3802 fall H5307 (8799) from my shoulder blade H7929, and mine arm H0248 be broken H7665 (8735) from the bone H7070.
031:023 For destruction H0343 [from] God H0410 [was] a terror H6343 to me, and by reason of his highness H7613 I could H3201 (8799) not endure.
031:024 If I have made H7760 (8804) gold H2091 my hope H3689, or have said H0559 (8804) to the fine gold H3800, [Thou art] my confidence H4009;
031:025 If I rejoiced H8055 (8799) because my wealth H2428 [was] great H7227, and because mine hand H3027 had gotten H4672 (8804) much H3524;
031:026 If I beheld H7200 (8799) the sun H0216 when it shined H1984 (8686), or the moon H3394 walking H1980 (8802) [in] brightness H3368;
031:027 And my heart H3820 hath been secretly H5643 enticed H6601 (8799), or my mouth H6310 hath kissed H5401 (8799) my hand H3027:
031:028 This also [were] an iniquity H5771 [to be punished by] the judge H6416: for I should have denied H3584 (8765) the God H0410 [that is] above H4605.
031:029 If I rejoiced H8055 (8799) at the destruction H6365 of him that hated H8130 (8764) me, or lifted up H5782 (8712) myself when evil H7451 found H4672 (8804) him:
031:030 Neither have I suffered H5414 (8804) my mouth H2441 to sin H2398 (8800) by wishing H7592 (8800) a curse H0423 to his soul H5315.
031:031 If the men H4962 of my tabernacle H0168 said H0559 (8804) not, Oh that we had H5414 (8799) of his flesh H1320! we cannot be satisfied H7646 (8799).
031:032 The stranger H1616 did not lodge H3885 (8799) in the street H2351: [but] I opened H6605 (8799) my doors H1817 to the traveller H0734.
031:033 If I covered H3680 (8765) my transgressions H6588 as Adam H0121, by hiding H2934 (8800) mine iniquity H5771 in my bosom H2243:
031:034 Did I fear H6206 (8799) a great H7227 multitude H1995, or did the contempt H0937 of families H4940 terrify H2865 (8686) me, that I kept silence H1826 (8799), [and] went not out H3318 (8799) of the door H6607?
031:035 Oh that H5414 (8799) one would hear H8085 (8802) me! behold, my desire H8420 [is, that] the Almighty H7706 would answer H6030 (8799) me, and [that] mine adversary H0376 H7379 had written H3789 (8804) a book H5612.
031:036 Surely I would take H5375 (8799) it upon my shoulder H7926, [and] bind H6029 (8799) it [as] a crown H5850 to me.
031:037 I would declare H5046 (8686) unto him the number H4557 of my steps H6806; as a prince H5057 would I go near H7126 (8762) unto him.
031:038 If my land H0127 cry H2199 (8799) against me, or that the furrows H8525 likewise H3162 thereof complain H1058 (8799);
031:039 If I have eaten H0398 (8804) the fruits H3581 thereof without money H3701, or have caused the owners H1167 thereof to lose H5301 (8689) their life H5315:
031:040 Let thistles H2336 grow H3318 (8799) instead of wheat H2406, and cockle H0890 instead of barley H8184. The words H1697 of Job H0347 are ended H8552 (8804).
032:001 ¶  So these three H7969 men H0582 ceased H7673 (8799) to answer H6030 (8800) Job H0347, because he [was] righteous H6662 in his own eyes H5869.
032:002 Then was kindled H2734 (8799) the wrath H0639 of Elihu H0453 the son H1121 of Barachel H1292 the Buzite H0940, of the kindred H4940 of Ram H7410: against Job H0347 was his wrath H0639 kindled H2734 (8804), because he justified H6663 (8763) himself H5315 rather than God H0430.
032:003 Also against his three H7969 friends H7453 was his wrath H0639 kindled H2734 (8804), because they had found H4672 (8804) no answer H4617, and [yet] had condemned H7561 (8686) Job H0347.
032:004 Now Elihu H0453 had waited H2442 (8765) till Job H0347 had spoken H1697, because they [were] elder H2205 H3117 than he.
032:005 When Elihu H0453 saw H7200 (8799) that [there was] no answer H4617 in the mouth H6310 of [these] three H7969 men H0582, then his wrath H0639 was kindled H2734 (8799).
032:006 And Elihu H0453 the son H1121 of Barachel H1292 the Buzite H0940 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), I [am] young H6810 H3117, and ye [are] very old H3453; wherefore I was afraid H2119 (8804), and durst H3372 (8799) not shew H2331 (8763) you mine opinion H1843.
032:007 I said H0559 (8804), Days H3117 should speak H1696 (8762), and multitude H7230 of years H8141 should teach H3045 (8686) wisdom H2451.
032:008 But H0403 [there is] a spirit H7307 in man H0582: and the inspiration H5397 of the Almighty H7706 giveth them understanding H0995 (8799).
032:009 Great men H7227 are not [always] wise H2449 (8799): neither do the aged H2205 understand H0995 (8799) judgment H4941.
032:010 Therefore I said H0559 (8804), Hearken H8085 (8798) to me; I also will shew H2331 (8762) mine opinion H1843.
032:011 Behold, I waited H3176 (8689) for your words H1697; I gave ear H0238 (8686) to your reasons H8394, whilst ye searched out H2713 (8799) what to say H4405.
032:012 Yea, I attended H0995 (8709) unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you that convinced H3198 (8688) Job H0347, [or] that answered H6030 (8802) his words H0561:
032:013 Lest ye should say H0559 (8799), We have found out H4672 (8804) wisdom H2451: God H0410 thrusteth him down H5086 (8799), not man H0376.
032:014 Now he hath not directed H6186 (8804) [his] words H4405 against me: neither will I answer H7725 (8686) him with your speeches H0561.
032:015 They were amazed H2865 (8804), they answered H6030 (8804) no more: they left off H6275 (8689) speaking H4405.
032:016 When I had waited H3176 (8689), (for they spake H1696 (8762) not, but stood still H5975 (8804), [and] answered H6030 (8804) no more;)
032:017 [I said], I will answer H6030 (8799) also my part H2506, I also will shew H2331 (8762) mine opinion H1843.
032:018 For I am full H4390 (8804) of matter H4405, the spirit H7307 within H0990 me constraineth H6693 (8689) me.
032:019 Behold, my belly H0990 [is] as wine H3196 [which] hath no vent H6605 (8735); it is ready to burst H1234 (8735) like new H2319 bottles H0178.
032:020 I will speak H1696 (8762), that I may be refreshed H7304 (8799): I will open H6605 (8799) my lips H8193 and answer H6030 (8799).
032:021 Let me not, I pray you, accept H5375 (8799) any man’s H0376 person H6440, neither let me give flattering titles H3655 (8762) unto man H0120.
032:022 For I know H3045 (8804) not to give flattering titles H3655 (8762); [in so doing] my maker H6213 (8802) would soon H4592 take me away H5375 (8799).
033:001 ¶  Wherefore H0199, Job H0347, I pray thee, hear H8085 (8798) my speeches H4405, and hearken H0238 (8685) to all my words H1697.
033:002 Behold, now I have opened H6605 (8804) my mouth H6310, my tongue H3956 hath spoken H1696 (8765) in my mouth H2441.
033:003 My words H0561 [shall be of] the uprightness H3476 of my heart H3820: and my lips H8193 shall utter H4448 (8765) knowledge H1847 clearly H1305 (8803).
033:004 The Spirit H7307 of God H0410 hath made H6213 (8804) me, and the breath H5397 of the Almighty H7706 hath given me life H2421 (8762).
033:005 If thou canst H3201 (8799) answer H7725 (8687) me, set [thy words] in order H6186 (8798) before H6440 me, stand up H3320 (8690).
033:006 Behold, I [am] according to thy wish H6310 in God’s H0410 stead: I also am formed H7169 (8795) out of the clay H2563.
033:007 Behold, my terror H0367 shall not make thee afraid H1204 (8762), neither shall my hand H0405 be heavy H3513 (8799) upon thee.
033:008 Surely thou hast spoken H0559 (8804) in mine hearing H0241, and I have heard H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of [thy] words H4405, [saying],
033:009 I am clean H2134 without transgression H6588, I [am] innocent H2643; neither [is there] iniquity H5771 in me.
033:010 Behold, he findeth H4672 (8799) occasions H8569 against me, he counteth H2803 (8799) me for his enemy H0341 (8802),
033:011 He putteth H7760 (8799) my feet H7272 in the stocks H5465, he marketh H8104 (8799) all my paths H0734.
033:012 Behold, [in] this thou art not just H6663 (8804): I will answer H6030 (8799) thee, that God H0433 is greater H7235 (8799) than man H0582.
033:013 Why dost thou strive H7378 (8804) against him? for he giveth not account H6030 (8799) of any of his matters H1697.
033:014 For God H0410 speaketh H1696 (8762) once H0259, yea twice H8147, [yet man] perceiveth H7789 (8799) it not.
033:015 In a dream H2472, in a vision H2384 of the night H3915, when deep H8639 sleep falleth H5307 (8800) upon men H0582, in slumberings H8572 upon the bed H4904;
033:016 Then he openeth H1540 (8799) the ears H0241 of men H0582, and sealeth H2856 (8799) their instruction H4561,
033:017 That he may withdraw H5493 (8687) man H0120 [from his] purpose H4639, and hide H3680 (8762) pride H1466 from man H1397.
033:018 He keepeth back H2820 (8799) his soul H5315 from the pit H7845, and his life H2416 from perishing H5674 (8800) by the sword H7973.
033:019 He is chastened H3198 (8717) also with pain H4341 upon his bed H4904, and the multitude H7230 (8675) H7379 of his bones H6106 with strong H0386 [pain]:
033:020 So that his life H2416 abhorreth H2092 (8765) bread H3899, and his soul H5315 dainty H8378 meat H3978.
033:021 His flesh H1320 is consumed away H3615 (8799), that it cannot be seen H7210; and his bones H6106 [that] were not seen H7200 (8795) stick out H8192 (8795) (8675) H8205.
033:022 Yea, his soul H5315 draweth near H7126 (8799) unto the grave H7845, and his life H2416 to the destroyers H4191 (8688).
033:023 If there H3426 be a messenger H4397 with him, an interpreter H3887 (8688), one H0259 among a thousand H0505, to shew H5046 (8687) unto man H0120 his uprightness H3476:
033:024 Then he is gracious H2603 (8799) unto him, and saith H0559 (8799), Deliver H6308 (8798) him from going down H3381 (8800) to the pit H7845: I have found H4672 (8804) a ransom H3724.
033:025 His flesh H1320 shall be fresher H7375 (8738) than a child’s H5290: he shall return H7725 (8799) to the days H3117 of his youth H5934:
033:026 He shall pray H6279 (8799) unto God H0433, and he will be favourable H7521 (8799) unto him: and he shall see H7200 (8799) his face H6440 with joy H8643: for he will render H7725 (8686) unto man H0582 his righteousness H6666.
033:027 He looketh H7789 (8799) upon men H0582, and [if any] say H0559 (8799), I have sinned H2398 (8804), and perverted H5753 (8689) [that which was] right H3477, and it profited H7737 (8804) me not;
033:028 He will deliver H6299 (8804) his soul H5315 from going H5674 (8800) into the pit H7845, and his life H2416 shall see H7200 (8799) the light H0216.
033:029 Lo, all these [things] worketh H6466 (8799) God H0410 oftentimes H6471 H7969 with man H1397,
033:030 To bring back H7725 (8687) his soul H5315 from the pit H7845, to be enlightened H0215 (8736) with the light H0216 of the living H2416.
033:031 Mark well H7181 (8685), O Job H0347, hearken H8085 (8798) unto me: hold thy peace H2790 (8685), and I will speak H1696 (8762).
033:032 If thou hast H3426 any thing to say H4405, answer H7725 (8685) me: speak H1696 (8761), for I desire H2654 (8804) to justify H6663 (8763) thee.
033:033 If not, hearken H8085 (8798) unto me: hold thy peace H2790 (8685), and I shall teach H0502 (8762) thee wisdom H2451.
034:001 ¶  Furthermore Elihu H0453 answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799),
034:002 Hear H8085 (8798) my words H4405, O ye wise H2450 [men]; and give ear H0238 (8685) unto me, ye that have knowledge H3045 (8802).
034:003 For the ear H0241 trieth H0974 (8799) words H4405, as the mouth H2441 tasteth H2938 (8799) meat H0398 (8800).
034:004 Let us choose H0977 (8799) to us judgment H4941: let us know H3045 (8799) among ourselves what [is] good H2896.
034:005 For Job H0347 hath said H0559 (8804), I am righteous H6663 (8804): and God H0410 hath taken away H5493 (8689) my judgment H4941.
034:006 Should I lie H3576 (8762) against my right H4941? my wound H2671 [is] incurable H0605 (8803) without transgression H6588.
034:007 What man H1397 [is] like Job H0347, [who] drinketh up H8354 (8799) scorning H3933 like water H4325?
034:008 Which goeth H0732 (8804) in company H2274 with the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205, and walketh H3212 (8800) with wicked H7562 men H0582.
034:009 For he hath said H0559 (8804), It profiteth H5532 (8799) a man H1397 nothing that he should delight H7521 (8800) himself with God H0430.
034:010 Therefore hearken H8085 (8798) unto me, ye men H0582 of understanding H3824: far be it H2486 from God H0410, [that he should do] wickedness H7562; and [from] the Almighty H7706, [that he should commit] iniquity H5766.
034:011 For the work H6467 of a man H0120 shall he render H7999 (8762) unto him, and cause every man H0376 to find H4672 (8686) according to [his] ways H0734.
034:012 Yea, surely H0551 God H0410 will not do wickedly H7561 (8686), neither will the Almighty H7706 pervert H5791 (8762) judgment H4941.
034:013 Who hath given him a charge H6485 (8804) over the earth H0776? or who hath disposed H7760 (8804) the whole world H8398?
034:014 If he set H7760 (8799) his heart H3820 upon man, [if] he gather H0622 (8799) unto himself his spirit H7307 and his breath H5397;
034:015 All flesh H1320 shall perish H1478 (8799) together H3162, and man H0120 shall turn again H7725 (8799) unto dust H6083.
034:016 If now [thou hast] understanding H0998, hear H8085 (8798) this: hearken H0238 (8685) to the voice H6963 of my words H4405.
034:017 Shall even he that hateth H8130 (8802) right H4941 govern H2280 (8799)? and wilt thou condemn H7561 (8686) him that is most H3524 just H6662?
034:018 [Is it fit] to say H0559 (8800) to a king H4428, [Thou art] wicked H1100? [and] to princes H5081, [Ye are] ungodly H7563?
034:019 [How much less to him] that accepteth H5375 (8804) not the persons H6440 of princes H8269, nor regardeth H5234 (8765) the rich H7771 more than H6440 the poor H1800? for they all [are] the work H4639 of his hands H3027.
034:020 In a moment H7281 shall they die H4191 (8799), and the people H5971 shall be troubled H1607 (8792) at midnight H2676 H3915, and pass away H5674 (8799): and the mighty H0047 shall be taken away H5493 (8686) without hand H3027.
034:021 For his eyes H5869 [are] upon the ways H1870 of man H0376, and he seeth H7200 (8799) all his goings H6806.
034:022 [There is] no darkness H2822, nor shadow of death H6757, where the workers H6466 (8802) of iniquity H0205 may hide H5641 (8736) themselves.
034:023 For he will not lay H7760 (8799) upon man H0376 more [than right]; that he should enter H1980 (8800) into judgment H4941 with God H0410.
034:024 He shall break in pieces H7489 (8799) mighty men H3524 without number H2714, and set H5975 (8686) others H0312 in their stead.
034:025 Therefore he knoweth H5234 (8686) their works H4566, and he overturneth H2015 (8804) [them] in the night H3915, so that they are destroyed H1792 (8691).
034:026 He striketh H5606 (8804) them as H8478 wicked men H7563 in the open H4725 sight H7200 (8802) of others;
034:027 Because they turned back H5493 (8804) from him H0310, and would not consider H7919 (8689) any of his ways H1870:
034:028 So that they cause the cry H6818 of the poor H1800 to come H0935 (8687) unto him, and he heareth H8085 (8799) the cry H6818 of the afflicted H6041.
034:029 When he giveth quietness H8252 (8686), who then can make trouble H7561 (8686)? and when he hideth H5641 (8686) [his] face H6440, who then can behold H7789 (8799) him? whether [it be done] against a nation H1471, or against a man H0120 only H3162:
034:030 That the hypocrite H0120 H2611 reign H4427 (8800) not, lest the people H5971 be ensnared H4170.
034:031 Surely it is meet to be said H0559 (8736) unto God H0410, I have borne H5375 (8804) [chastisement], I will not offend H2254 (8799) [any more]:
034:032 [That which] I see H2372 (8799) not H1107 teach H3384 (8685) thou me: if I have done H6466 (8804) iniquity H5766, I will do H3254 (8686) no more.
034:033 [Should it be] according to thy mind? he will recompense H7999 (8762) it, whether thou refuse H3588 H3988 (8804), or whether thou choose H0977 (8799); and not I: therefore speak H1696 (8761) what thou knowest H3045 (8804).
034:034 Let men H0582 of understanding H3824 tell H0559 (8799) me, and let a wise H2450 man H1397 hearken H8085 (8802) unto me.
034:035 Job H0347 hath spoken H1696 (8762) without knowledge H1847, and his words H1697 [were] without wisdom H7919 (8687).
034:036 My desire H0015 (8676) H0001 [is that] Job H0347 may be tried H0974 (8735) unto the end H5331 because of [his] answers H8666 for wicked H0205 men H0582.
034:037 For he addeth H3254 (8686) rebellion H6588 unto his sin H2403, he clappeth H5606 (8799) [his hands] among us, and multiplieth H7235 (8686) his words H0561 against God H0410.
035:001 ¶  Elihu H0453 spake H6030 (8799) moreover, and said H0559 (8799),
035:002 Thinkest H2803 (8804) thou this to be right H4941, [that] thou saidst H0559 (8804), My righteousness H6664 [is] more than God’s H0410?
035:003 For thou saidst H0559 (8799), What advantage H5532 (8799) will it be unto thee? [and], What profit H3276 (8686) shall I have, [if I be cleansed] from my sin H2403?
035:004 I will answer H7725 (8686) H4405 thee, and thy companions H7453 with thee.
035:005 Look H5027 (8685) unto the heavens H8064, and see H7200 (8798); and behold H7789 (8798) the clouds H7834 [which] are higher H1361 (8804) than thou.
035:006 If thou sinnest H2398 (8804), what doest H6466 (8799) thou against him? or [if] thy transgressions H6588 be multiplied H7231 (8804), what doest H6213 (8799) thou unto him?
035:007 If thou be righteous H6663 (8804), what givest H5414 (8799) thou him? or what receiveth H3947 (8799) he of thine hand H3027?
035:008 Thy wickedness H7562 [may hurt] a man H0376 as thou [art]; and thy righteousness H6666 [may profit] the son H1121 of man H0120.
035:009 By reason of the multitude H7230 of oppressions H6217 they make [the oppressed] to cry H2199 (8686): they cry out H7768 (8762) by reason of the arm H2220 of the mighty H7227.
035:010 But none saith H0559 (8804), Where [is] God H0433 my maker H6213 (8802), who giveth H5414 (8802) songs H2158 in the night H3915;
035:011 Who teacheth H0502 (8764) us more than the beasts H0929 of the earth H0776, and maketh us wiser H2449 (8762) than the fowls H5775 of heaven H8064?
035:012 There they cry H6817 (8799), but none giveth answer H6030 (8799), because H6440 of the pride H1347 of evil men H7451.
035:013 Surely God H0410 will not hear H8085 (8799) vanity H7723, neither will the Almighty H7706 regard H7789 (8799) it.
035:014 Although H0637 thou sayest H0559 (8799) thou shalt not see H7789 (8799) him, [yet] judgment H1779 [is] before H6440 him; therefore trust H2342 (8787) thou in him.
035:015 But now, because [it is] not [so], he hath visited H6485 (8804) in his anger H0639; yet he knoweth H3045 (8804) [it] not in great H3966 extremity H6580:
035:016 Therefore doth Job H0347 open H6475 (8799) his mouth H6310 in vain H1892; he multiplieth H3527 (8686) words H4405 without H1097 knowledge H1847.
036:001 ¶  Elihu H0453 also proceeded H3254 (8686), and said H0559 (8799),
036:002 Suffer H3803 (8761) me a little H2191, and I will shew H2331 (8762) thee that [I have] yet to speak H4405 on God’s H0433 behalf.
036:003 I will fetch H5375 (8799) my knowledge H1843 from afar H7350, and will ascribe H5414 (8799) righteousness H6664 to my Maker H6466 (8802).
036:004 For truly H0551 my words H4405 [shall] not [be] false H8267: he that is perfect H8549 in knowledge H1844 [is] with thee.
036:005 Behold, God H0410 [is] mighty H3524, and despiseth H3988 (8799) not [any: he is] mighty H3524 in strength H3581 [and] wisdom H3820.
036:006 He preserveth not the life H2421 (8762) of the wicked H7563: but giveth H5414 (8799) right H4941 to the poor H6041.
036:007 He withdraweth H1639 (8799) not his eyes H5869 from the righteous H6662: but with kings H4428 [are they] on the throne H3678; yea, he doth establish H3427 (8686) them for ever H5331, and they are exalted H1361 (8799).
036:008 And if [they be] bound H0631 (8803) in fetters H2131, [and] be holden H3920 (8735) in cords H2256 of affliction H6040;
036:009 Then he sheweth H5046 (8686) them their work H6467, and their transgressions H6588 that they have exceeded H1396 (8691).
036:010 He openeth H1540 (8799) also their ear H0241 to discipline H4148, and commandeth H0559 (8799) that they return H7725 (8799) from iniquity H0205.
036:011 If they obey H8085 (8799) and serve H5647 (8799) [him], they shall spend H3615 (8762) their days H3117 in prosperity H2896, and their years H8141 in pleasures H5273.
036:012 But if they obey H8085 (8799) not, they shall perish H5674 (8799) by the sword H7973, and they shall die H1478 (8799) without knowledge H1847.
036:013 But the hypocrites H2611 in heart H3820 heap up H7760 (8799) wrath H0639: they cry H7768 (8762) not when he bindeth H0631 (8804) them.
036:014 They H5315 die H4191 (8799) in youth H5290, and their life H2416 [is] among the unclean H6945.
036:015 He delivereth H2502 (8762) the poor H6041 in his affliction H6040, and openeth H1540 (8799) their ears H0241 in oppression H3906.
036:016 Even so would he have removed H5496 (8689) thee out of the strait H6310 H6862 [into] a broad place H7338, where H8478 [there is] no straitness H4164; and that which should be set H5183 on thy table H7979 [should be] full H4390 (8804) of fatness H1880.
036:017 But thou hast fulfilled H4390 (8804) the judgment H1779 of the wicked H7563: judgment H1779 and justice H4941 take hold H8551 (8799) [on thee].
036:018 Because [there is] wrath H2534, [beware] lest he take thee away H5496 (8686) with [his] stroke H5607: then a great H7230 ransom H3724 cannot deliver H5186 (8686) thee.
036:019 Will he esteem H6186 (8799) thy riches H7769? [no], not gold H1222, nor all the forces H3981 of strength H3581.
036:020 Desire H7602 (8799) not the night H3915, when people H5971 are cut off H5927 (8800) in their place.
036:021 Take heed H8104 (8734), regard H6437 (8799) not iniquity H0205: for this hast thou chosen H0977 (8804) rather than affliction H6040.
036:022 Behold, God H0410 exalteth H7682 (8686) by his power H3581: who teacheth H3384 (8688) like him?
036:023 Who hath enjoined H6485 (8804) him his way H1870? or who can say H0559 (8804), Thou hast wrought H6466 (8804) iniquity H5766?
036:024 Remember H2142 (8798) that thou magnify H7679 (8686) his work H6467, which men H0582 behold H7891 (8790).
036:025 Every man H0120 may see H2372 (8804) it; man H0582 may behold H5027 (8686) [it] afar off H7350.
036:026 Behold, God H0410 [is] great H7689, and we know H3045 (8799) [him] not, neither can the number H4557 of his years H8141 be searched out H2714.
036:027 For he maketh small H1639 (8762) the drops H5198 of water H4325: they pour down H2212 (8799) rain H4306 according to the vapour H0108 thereof:
036:028 Which the clouds H7834 do drop H5140 (8799) [and] distil H7491 (8799) upon man H0120 abundantly H7227.
036:029 Also can [any] understand H0995 (8799) the spreadings H4666 of the clouds H5645, [or] the noise H8663 of his tabernacle H5521?
036:030 Behold, he spreadeth H6566 (8804) his light H0216 upon it, and covereth H3680 (8765) the bottom H8328 of the sea H3220.
036:031 For by them judgeth H1777 (8799) he the people H5971; he giveth H5414 (8799) meat H0400 in abundance H4342 (8688).
036:032 With clouds H3709 he covereth H3680 (8765) the light H0216; and commandeth H6680 (8762) it [not to shine] by [the cloud] that cometh betwixt H6293 (8688).
036:033 The noise H7452 thereof sheweth H5046 (8686) concerning it, the cattle H4735 also concerning the vapour H5927 (8802).
037:001 ¶  At this H2063 also my heart H3820 trembleth H2729 (8799), and is moved out H5425 (8799) of his place H4725.
037:002 Hear H8085 (8798) attentively H8085 (8800) the noise H7267 of his voice H6963, and the sound H1899 [that] goeth out H3318 (8799) of his mouth H6310.
037:003 He directeth H3474 (8765) it H8281 (8799) under the whole heaven H8064, and his lightning H0216 unto the ends H3671 of the earth H0776.
037:004 After H0310 it a voice H6963 roareth H7580 (8799): he thundereth H7481 (8686) with the voice H6963 of his excellency H1347; and he will not stay H6117 (8762) them when his voice H6963 is heard H8085 (8735).
037:005 God H0410 thundereth H7481 (8686) marvellously H6381 (8737) with his voice H6963; great things H1419 doeth H6213 (8802) he, which we cannot comprehend H3045 (8799).
037:006 For he saith H0559 (8799) to the snow H7950, Be thou H1933 (8798) [on] the earth H0776; likewise to the small H4306 rain H1653, and to the great H4306 rain H1653 of his strength H5797.
037:007 He sealeth up H2856 (8799) the hand H3027 of every man H0120; that all men H0582 may know H3045 (8800) his work H4639.
037:008 Then the beasts H2416 go H0935 (8799) into H1119 dens H0695, and remain H7931 (8799) in their places H4585.
037:009 Out of the south H2315 cometh H0935 (8799) the whirlwind H5492: and cold H7135 out of the north H4215.
037:010 By the breath H5397 of God H0410 frost H7140 is given H5414 (8799): and the breadth H7341 of the waters H4325 is straitened H4164.
037:011 Also by watering H7377 he wearieth H2959 (8686) the thick cloud H5645: he scattereth H6327 (8686) his bright H0216 cloud H6051:
037:012 And it is turned H2015 (8693) round about H4524 by his counsels H8458: that they may do H6467 whatsoever he commandeth H6680 (8762) them upon the face H6440 of the world H8398 in the earth H0776.
037:013 He causeth it to come H4672 (8686), whether for correction H7626, or for his land H0776, or for mercy H2617.
037:014 Hearken H0238 (8685) unto this, O Job H0347: stand still H5975 (8798), and consider H0995 (8708) the wondrous H6381 (8737) works of God H0410.
037:015 Dost thou know H3045 (8799) when God H0433 disposed H7760 (8800) them, and caused the light H0216 of his cloud H6051 to shine H3313 (8689)?
037:016 Dost thou know H3045 (8799) the balancings H4657 of the clouds H5645, the wondrous works H4652 of him which is perfect H8549 in knowledge H1843?
037:017 How thy garments H0899 [are] warm H2525, when he quieteth H8252 (8687) the earth H0776 by the south H1864 [wind]?
037:018 Hast thou with him spread out H7554 (8686) the sky H7834, [which is] strong H2389, [and] as a molten H3332 (8716) looking glass H7209?
037:019 Teach H3045 (8685) us what we shall say H0559 (8799) unto him; [for] we cannot order H6186 (8799) [our speech] by reason H6440 of darkness H2822.
037:020 Shall it be told H5608 (8792) him that I speak H1696 (8762)? if a man H0376 speak H0559 (8804), surely he shall be swallowed up H1104 (8792).
037:021 And now [men] see H7200 (8804) not the bright H0925 light H0216 which [is] in the clouds H7834: but the wind H7307 passeth H5674 (8804), and cleanseth H2891 (8762) them.
037:022 Fair weather H2091 cometh H0857 (8799) out of the north H6828: with God H0433 [is] terrible H3372 (8737) majesty H1935.
037:023 [Touching] the Almighty H7706, we cannot find him out H4672 (8804): [he is] excellent H7689 in power H3581, and in judgment H4941, and in plenty H7230 of justice H6666: he will not afflict H6031 (8762).
037:024 Men H0582 do therefore fear H3372 (8804) him: he respecteth H7200 (8799) not any [that are] wise H2450 of heart H3820.
038:001 ¶  Then the LORD H3068 answered H6030 (8799) Job H0347 out of the whirlwind H5591, and said H0559 (8799),
038:002 Who [is] this that darkeneth H2821 (8688) counsel H6098 by words H4405 without knowledge H1847?
038:003 Gird up H0247 (8798) now thy loins H2504 like a man H1397; for I will demand H7592 (8799) of thee, and answer H3045 (8685) thou me.
038:004 Where H0375 wast thou when I laid the foundations H3245 (8800) of the earth H0776? declare H5046 (8685), if thou hast H3045 (8804) understanding H0998.
038:005 Who hath laid H7760 (8804) the measures H4461 thereof, if thou knowest H3045 (8799)? or who hath stretched H5186 (8804) the line H6957 upon it?
038:006 Whereupon are the foundations H0134 thereof fastened H2883 (8717)? or who laid H3384 (8804) the corner H6438 stone H0068 thereof;
038:007 When the morning H1242 stars H3556 sang H7442 (8800) together H3162, and all the sons H1121 of God H0430 shouted H7321 (8686) for joy?
038:008 Or [who] shut up H5526 (8686) the sea H3220 with doors H1817, when it brake forth H1518 (8800), [as if] it had issued out H3318 (8799) of the womb H7358?
038:009 When I made H7760 (8800) the cloud H6051 the garment H3830 thereof, and thick darkness H6205 a swaddlingband H2854 for it,
038:010 And brake up H7665 (8799) for it my decreed H2706 [place], and set H7760 (8799) bars H1280 and doors H1817,
038:011 And said H0559 (8799), Hitherto H5704 H6311 shalt thou come H0935 (8799), but no further H3254 (8686): and here shall thy proud H1347 waves H1530 be stayed H7896 (8799)?
038:012 Hast thou commanded H6680 (8765) the morning H1242 since thy days H3117; [and] caused the dayspring H7837 to know H3045 (8765) his place H4725;
038:013 That it might take hold H0270 (8800) of the ends H3671 of the earth H0776, that the wicked H7563 might be shaken out H5287 (8735) of it?
038:014 It is turned H2015 (8691) as clay H2563 [to] the seal H2368; and they stand H3320 (8691) as a garment H3830.
038:015 And from the wicked H7563 their light H0216 is withholden H4513 (8735), and the high H7311 (8802) arm H2220 shall be broken H7665 (8735).
038:016 Hast thou entered H0935 (8804) into the springs H5033 of the sea H3220? or hast thou walked H1980 (8694) in the search H2714 of the depth H8415?
038:017 Have the gates H8179 of death H4194 been opened H1540 (8738) unto thee? or hast thou seen H7200 (8799) the doors H8179 of the shadow of death H6757?
038:018 Hast thou perceived H0995 (8712) the breadth H7338 of the earth H0776? declare H5046 (8685) if thou knowest H3045 (8804) it all.
038:019 Where [is] the way H1870 [where] light H0216 dwelleth H7931 (8799)? and [as for] darkness H2822, where [is] the place H4725 thereof,
038:020 That thou shouldest take H3947 (8799) it to the bound H1366 thereof, and that thou shouldest know H0995 (8799) the paths H5410 [to] the house H1004 thereof?
038:021 Knowest H3045 (8804) thou [it], because thou wast then born H3205 (8735)? or [because] the number H4557 of thy days H3117 [is] great H7227?
038:022 Hast thou entered H0935 (8804) into the treasures H0214 of the snow H7950? or hast thou seen H7200 (8799) the treasures H0214 of the hail H1259,
038:023 Which I have reserved H2820 (8804) against the time H6256 of trouble H6862, against the day H3117 of battle H7128 and war H4421?
038:024 By what H0335 way H1870 is the light H0216 parted H2505 (8735), [which] scattereth H6327 (8686) the east wind H6921 upon the earth H0776?
038:025 Who hath divided H6385 (8765) a watercourse H8585 for the overflowing of waters H7858, or a way H1870 for the lightning H2385 of thunder H6963;
038:026 To cause it to rain H4305 (8687) on the earth H0776, [where] no man H0376 [is; on] the wilderness H4057, wherein [there is] no man H0120;
038:027 To satisfy H7646 (8687) the desolate H7722 and waste H4875 [ground]; and to cause the bud H4161 of the tender herb H1877 to spring forth H6779 (8687)?
038:028 Hath H3426 the rain H4306 a father H0001? or who hath begotten H3205 (8689) the drops H0096 of dew H2919?
038:029 Out of whose womb H0990 came H3318 (8804) the ice H7140? and the hoary frost H3713 of heaven H8064, who hath gendered H3205 (8804) it?
038:030 The waters H4325 are hid H2244 (8691) as [with] a stone H0068, and the face H6440 of the deep H8415 is frozen H3920 (8691).
038:031 Canst thou bind H7194 (8762) the sweet influences H4575 of Pleiades H3598, or loose H6605 (8762) the bands H4189 of Orion H3685?
038:032 Canst thou bring forth H3318 (8686) Mazzaroth H4216 in his season H6256? or canst thou guide H5148 (8686) Arcturus H5906 with his sons H1121?
038:033 Knowest H3045 (8804) thou the ordinances H2708 of heaven H8064? canst thou set H7760 (8799) the dominion H4896 thereof in the earth H0776?
038:034 Canst thou lift up H7311 (8686) thy voice H6963 to the clouds H5645, that abundance H8229 of waters H4325 may cover H3680 (8762) thee?
038:035 Canst thou send H7971 (8762) lightnings H1300, that they may go H3212 (8799), and say H0559 (8799) unto thee, Here we [are]?
038:036 Who hath put H7896 (8804) wisdom H2451 in the inward parts H2910? or who hath given H5414 (8804) understanding H0998 to the heart H7907?
038:037 Who can number H5608 (8762) the clouds H7834 in wisdom H2451? or who can stay H7901 (8686) the bottles H5035 of heaven H8064,
038:038 When the dust H6083 groweth H3332 (8800) into hardness H4165, and the clods H7263 cleave fast together H1692 (8792)?
038:039 Wilt thou hunt H6679 (8799) the prey H2964 for the lion H3833? or fill H4390 (8762) the appetite H2416 of the young lions H3715,
038:040 When they couch H7817 (8799) in [their] dens H4585, [and] abide H3427 (8799) in the covert H5521 to H3926 lie in wait H0695?
038:041 Who provideth H3559 (8686) for the raven H6158 his food H6718? when his young ones H3206 cry H7768 (8762) unto God H0410, they wander H8582 (8799) for lack H1097 of meat H0400.
039:001 ¶  Knowest H3045 (8804) thou the time H6256 when the wild goats H3277 of the rock H5553 bring forth H3205 (8800)? [or] canst thou mark H8104 (8799) when the hinds H0355 do calve H2342 (8790)?
039:002 Canst thou number H5608 (8799) the months H3391 [that] they fulfil H4390 (8762)? or knowest H3045 (8804) thou the time H6256 when they bring forth H3205 (8800)?
039:003 They bow H3766 (8799) themselves, they bring forth H6398 (8762) their young ones H3206, they cast out H7971 (8762) their sorrows H2256.
039:004 Their young ones H1121 are in good liking H2492 (8799), they grow up H7235 (8799) with corn H1250; they go forth H3318 (8804), and return H7725 (8804) not unto them.
039:005 Who hath sent out H7971 (8765) the wild ass H6501 free H2670? or who hath loosed H6605 (8765) the bands H4147 of the wild ass H6171?
039:006 Whose house H1004 I have made H7760 (8804) the wilderness H6160, and the barren H4420 land his dwellings H4908.
039:007 He scorneth H7832 (8799) the multitude H1995 of the city H7151, neither regardeth H8085 (8799) he the crying H8663 of the driver H5065 (8802).
039:008 The range H3491 of the mountains H2022 [is] his pasture H4829, and he searcheth H1875 (8799) after H0310 every green thing H3387.
039:009 Will the unicorn H7214 be willing H0014 (8799) to serve H5647 (8800) thee, or abide H3885 (8799) by thy crib H0018?
039:010 Canst thou bind H7194 (8799) the unicorn H7214 with his band H5688 in the furrow H8525? or will he harrow H7702 (8762) the valleys H6010 after H0310 thee?
039:011 Wilt thou trust H0982 (8799) him, because his strength H3581 [is] great H7227? or wilt thou leave H5800 (8799) thy labour H3018 to him?
039:012 Wilt thou believe H0539 (8686) him, that he will bring home H7725 (8686) (8675) H7725 (8799) thy seed H2233, and gather H0622 (8799) [it into] thy barn H1637?
039:013 [Gavest thou] the goodly H7443 wings H3671 unto the peacocks H5965 (8738)? or wings H0084 and feathers H2624 unto the ostrich H5133?
039:014 Which leaveth H5800 (8799) her eggs H1000 in the earth H0776, and warmeth H2552 (8762) them in dust H6083,
039:015 And forgetteth H7911 (8799) that the foot H7272 may crush H2115 (8799) them, or that the wild H7704 beast H2416 may break H1758 (8799) them.
039:016 She is hardened H7188 (8689) against her young ones H1121, as though [they were] not H3808 hers: her labour H3018 is in vain H7385 without fear H6343;
039:017 Because God H0433 hath deprived H5382 (8689) her of wisdom H2451, neither hath he imparted H2505 (8804) to her understanding H0998.
039:018 What time H6256 she lifteth up H4754 (8686) herself on high H4791, she scorneth H7832 (8799) the horse H5483 and his rider H7392 (8802).
039:019 Hast thou given H5414 (8799) the horse H5483 strength H1369? hast thou clothed H3847 (8686) his neck H6677 with thunder H7483?
039:020 Canst thou make him afraid H7493 (8686) as a grasshopper H0697? the glory H1935 of his nostrils H5170 [is] terrible H0367.
039:021 He paweth H2658 (8799) in the valley H6010, and rejoiceth H7797 (8799) in [his] strength H3581: he goeth on H3318 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) the armed men H5402.
039:022 He mocketh H7832 (8799) at fear H6343, and is not affrighted H2865 (8735); neither turneth he back H7725 (8799) from H6440 the sword H2719.
039:023 The quiver H0827 rattleth H7439 (8799) against him, the glittering H3851 spear H2595 and the shield H3591.
039:024 He swalloweth H1572 (8762) the ground H0776 with fierceness H7494 and rage H7267: neither believeth H0539 (8686) he that [it is] the sound H6963 of the trumpet H7782.
039:025 He saith H0559 (8799) among H1767 the trumpets H7782, Ha H1889, ha H1889; and he smelleth H7306 (8686) the battle H4421 afar off H7350, the thunder H7482 of the captains H8269, and the shouting H8643.
039:026 Doth the hawk H5322 fly H0082 (8686) by thy wisdom H0998, [and] stretch H6566 (8799) her wings H3671 toward the south H8486?
039:027 Doth the eagle H5404 mount up H1361 (8686) at thy command H6310, and make H7311 her nest H7064 on high H7311 (8686)?
039:028 She dwelleth H7931 (8799) and abideth H3885 (8698) on the rock H5553, upon the crag H8127 of the rock H5553, and the strong place H4686.
039:029 From thence she seeketh H2658 (8804) the prey H0400, [and] her eyes H5869 behold H5027 (8686) afar off H7350.
039:030 Her young ones H0667 also suck up H5966 (8762) blood H1818: and where the slain H2491 [are], there [is] she H1931.
040:001 ¶  Moreover the LORD H3068 answered H6030 (8799) Job H0347, and said H0559 (8799),
040:002 Shall he that contendeth H7378 (8800) with the Almighty H7706 instruct H3250 [him]? he that reproveth H3198 (8688) God H0433, let him answer H6030 (8799) it.
040:003 Then Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799),
040:004 Behold, I am vile H7043 (8804); what shall I answer H7725 (8686) thee? I will lay H7760 (8804) mine hand H3027 upon H3926 my mouth H6310.
040:005 Once H0259 have I spoken H1696 (8765); but I will not answer H6030 (8799): yea, twice H8147; but I will proceed no further H3254 (8686).
040:006 Then answered H6030 (8799) the LORD H3068 unto Job H0347 out of the whirlwind H5591, and said H0559 (8799),
040:007 Gird up H0247 (8798) thy loins H2504 now like a man H1397: I will demand H7592 (8799) of thee, and declare H3045 (8685) thou unto me.
040:008 Wilt thou also disannul H6565 (8686) my judgment H4941? wilt thou condemn H7561 (8686) me, that thou mayest be righteous H6663 (8799)?
040:009 Hast thou an arm H2220 like God H0410? or canst thou thunder H7481 (8686) with a voice H6963 like him?
040:010 Deck H5710 (8798) thyself now [with] majesty H1347 and excellency H1363; and array H3847 (8799) thyself with glory H1935 and beauty H1926.
040:011 Cast abroad H6327 (8685) the rage H5678 of thy wrath H0639: and behold H7200 (8798) every one [that is] proud H1343, and abase H8213 (8685) him.
040:012 Look H7200 (8798) on every one [that is] proud H1343, [and] bring him low H3665 (8685); and tread down H1915 (8798) the wicked H7563 in their place.
040:013 Hide H2934 (8798) them in the dust H6083 together H3162; [and] bind H2280 (8798) their faces H6440 in secret H2934 (8803).
040:014 Then will I also confess H3034 (8686) unto thee that thine own right hand H3225 can save H3467 (8686) thee.
040:015 Behold now behemoth H0930, which I made H6213 (8804) with thee; he eateth H0398 (8799) grass H2682 as an ox H1241.
040:016 Lo now, his strength H3581 [is] in his loins H4975, and his force H0202 [is] in the navel H8306 of his belly H0990.
040:017 He moveth H2654 (8799) his tail H2180 like a cedar H0730: the sinews H1517 of his stones H6344 are wrapped together H8276 (8792).
040:018 His bones H6106 [are as] strong H0650 pieces of brass H5154; his bones H1634 [are] like bars H4300 of iron H1270.
040:019 He [is] the chief H7225 of the ways H1870 of God H0410: he that made H6213 (8802) him can make H5066 his sword H2719 to approach H5066 (8686) [unto him].
040:020 Surely the mountains H2022 bring him forth H5375 (8799) food H0944, where all the beasts H2416 of the field H7704 play H7832 (8762).
040:021 He lieth H7901 (8799) under the shady trees H6628, in the covert H5643 of the reed H7070, and fens H1207.
040:022 The shady trees H6628 cover H5526 (8799) him [with] their shadow H6752; the willows H6155 of the brook H5158 compass him about H5437 (8799).
040:023 Behold, he drinketh up H6231 (8799) a river H5104, [and] hasteth H2648 (8799) not: he trusteth H0982 (8799) that he can draw up H1518 (8799) Jordan H3383 into his mouth H6310.
040:024 He taketh H3947 (8799) it with his eyes H5869: [his] nose H0639 pierceth through H5344 (8799) snares H4170.
041:001 ¶  Canst thou draw out H4900 (8799) leviathan H3882 with an hook H2443? or his tongue H3956 with a cord H2256 [which] thou lettest down H8257 (8686)?
041:002 Canst thou put H7760 (8799) an hook H0100 into his nose H0639? or bore H5344 (8799) his jaw H3895 through with a thorn H2336?
041:003 Will he make many H7235 (8686) supplications H8469 unto thee? will he speak H1696 (8762) soft H7390 [words] unto thee?
041:004 Will he make H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 with thee? wilt thou take H3947 (8799) him for a servant H5650 for ever H5769?
041:005 Wilt thou play H7832 (8762) with him as [with] a bird H6833? or wilt thou bind H7194 (8799) him for thy maidens H5291?
041:006 Shall the companions H2271 make a banquet H3739 (8799) of him? shall they part H2673 (8799) him among the merchants H3669?
041:007 Canst thou fill H4390 (8762) his skin H5785 with barbed irons H7905? or his head H7218 with fish H1709 spears H6767?
041:008 Lay H7760 (8798) thine hand H3709 upon him, remember H2142 (8798) the battle H4421, do no more H3254 (8686).
041:009 Behold, the hope H8431 of him is in vain H3576 (8738): shall not [one] be cast down H2904 (8714) even at the sight H4758 of him?
041:010 None [is so] fierce H0393 that dare stir him up H5782 (8799) (8675) H5782 (8686): who then is able to stand H3320 (8691) before H6440 me?
041:011 Who hath prevented H6923 (8689) me, that I should repay H7999 (8762) [him? whatsoever is] under the whole heaven H8064 is mine.
041:012 I will not conceal H2790 (8686) his parts H0907, nor his power H1369 H1697, nor his comely H2433 proportion H6187.
041:013 Who can discover H1540 (8765) the face H6440 of his garment H3830? [or] who can come H0935 (8799) [to him] with his double H3718 bridle H7448?
041:014 Who can open H6605 (8765) the doors H1817 of his face H6440? his teeth H8127 [are] terrible H0367 round about H5439.
041:015 [His] scales H4043 H0650 [are his] pride H1346, shut up together H5462 (8803) [as with] a close H6862 seal H2368.
041:016 One H0259 is so near H5066 (8799) to another H0259, that no air H7307 can come H0935 (8799) between them.
041:017 They are joined H1692 (8792) one H0376 to another H0251, they stick together H3920 (8691), that they cannot be sundered H6504 (8691).
041:018 By his neesings H5846 a light H0216 doth shine H1984 (8686), and his eyes H5869 [are] like the eyelids H6079 of the morning H7837.
041:019 Out of his mouth H6310 go H1980 (8799) burning lamps H3940, [and] sparks H3590 of fire H0784 leap out H4422 (8691).
041:020 Out of his nostrils H5156 goeth H3318 (8799) smoke H6227, as [out] of a seething H5301 (8803) pot H1731 or caldron H0100.
041:021 His breath H5315 kindleth H3857 (8762) coals H1513, and a flame H3851 goeth out H3318 (8799) of his mouth H6310.
041:022 In his neck H6677 remaineth H3885 (8799) strength H5797, and sorrow H1670 is turned into joy H1750 (8799) before H6440 him.
041:023 The flakes H4651 of his flesh H1320 are joined together H1692 (8804): they are firm H3332 (8803) in themselves; they cannot be moved H4131 (8735).
041:024 His heart H3820 is as firm H3332 (8803) as a stone H0068; yea, as hard H3332 (8803) as a piece H6400 of the nether H8482 [millstone].
041:025 When he raiseth up H7613 himself, the mighty H0352 are afraid H1481 (8799): by reason of breakings H7667 they purify H2398 (8691) themselves.
041:026 The sword H2719 of him that layeth H5381 (8688) at him cannot hold H6965 (8799): the spear H2595, the dart H4551, nor the habergeon H8302.
041:027 He esteemeth H2803 (8799) iron H1270 as straw H8401, [and] brass H5154 as rotten H7539 wood H6086.
041:028 The arrow H1121 H7198 cannot make him flee H1272 (8686): slingstones H0068 H7050 are turned H2015 (8738) with him into stubble H7179.
041:029 Darts H8455 are counted H2803 (8738) as stubble H7179: he laugheth H7832 (8799) at the shaking H7494 of a spear H3591.
041:030 Sharp H2303 stones H2789 [are] under him: he spreadeth H7502 (8799) sharp pointed things H2742 upon the mire H2916.
041:031 He maketh the deep H4688 to boil H7570 (8686) like a pot H5518: he maketh H7760 (8799) the sea H3220 like a pot of ointment H4841.
041:032 He maketh a path H5410 to shine H0215 (8686) after H0310 him; [one] would think H2803 (8799) the deep H8415 [to be] hoary H7872.
041:033 Upon earth H6083 there is not his like H4915, who is made H6213 (8803) without H1097 fear H2844.
041:034 He beholdeth H7200 (8799) all high H1364 [things]: he [is] a king H4428 over all the children H1121 of pride H7830.
042:001 ¶  Then Job H0347 answered H6030 (8799) the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799),
042:002 I know H3045 (8804) that thou canst do H3201 (8799) every [thing], and [that] no thought H4209 can be withholden H1219 (8735) from thee.
042:003 Who [is] he that hideth H5956 (8688) counsel H6098 without knowledge H1847? therefore have I uttered H5046 (8689) that I understood H0995 (8799) not; things too wonderful H6381 (8737) for me, which I knew H3045 (8799) not.
042:004 Hear H8085 (8798), I beseech thee, and I will speak H1696 (8762): I will demand H7592 (8799) of thee, and declare H3045 (8685) thou unto me.
042:005 I have heard H8085 (8804) of thee by the hearing H8088 of the ear H0241: but now mine eye H5869 seeth H7200 (8804) thee.
042:006 Wherefore I abhor H3988 (8799) [myself], and repent H5162 (8738) in dust H6083 and ashes H0665.
042:007 And it was [so], that after H0310 the LORD H3068 had spoken H1696 (8765) these words H1697 unto Job H0347, the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) to Eliphaz H0464 the Temanite H8489, My wrath H0639 is kindled H2734 (8804) against thee, and against thy two H8147 friends H7453: for ye have not spoken H1696 (8765) of me [the thing that is] right H3559 (8737), as my servant H5650 Job H0347 [hath].
042:008 Therefore take H3947 (8798) unto you now seven H7651 bullocks H6499 and seven H7651 rams H0352, and go H3212 (8798) to my servant H5650 Job H0347, and offer up H5927 (8689) for yourselves a burnt offering H5930; and my servant H5650 Job H0347 shall pray H6419 (8691) for you: for him H6440 will I accept H5375 (8799): lest I deal H6213 (8800) with you [after your] folly H5039, in that ye have not spoken H1696 (8765) of me [the thing which is] right H3559 (8737), like my servant H5650 Job H0347.
042:009 So Eliphaz H0464 the Temanite H8489 and Bildad H1085 the Shuhite H7747 [and] Zophar H6691 the Naamathite H5284 went H3212 (8799), and did H6213 (8799) according as the LORD H3068 commanded H1696 (8765) them: the LORD H3068 also accepted H5375 (8799) Job H6440 H0347.
042:010 And the LORD H3068 turned H7725 (8804) the captivity H7622 (8675) H7622 of Job H0347, when he prayed H6419 (8692) for his friends H7453: also the LORD H3068 gave H3254 (8686) Job H0347 twice as much H4932 as he had before.
042:011 Then came H0935 (8799) there unto him all his brethren H0251, and all his sisters H0269, and all they that had been of his acquaintance H3045 (8802) before H6440, and did eat H0398 (8799) bread H3899 with him in his house H1004: and they bemoaned H5110 (8799) him, and comforted H5162 (8762) him over all the evil H7451 that the LORD H3068 had brought H0935 (8689) upon him: every man H0376 also gave H5414 (8799) him a H0259 piece of money H7192, and every one H0376 an earring H5141 of gold H2091.
042:012 So the LORD H3068 blessed H1288 (8765) the latter end H0319 of Job H0347 more than his beginning H7225: for he had fourteen H0702 H6240 thousand H0505 sheep H6629, and six H8337 thousand H0505 camels H1581, and a thousand H0505 yoke H6776 of oxen H1241, and a thousand H0505 she asses H0860.
042:013 He had also seven H7658 sons H1121 and three H7969 daughters H1323.
042:014 And he called H7121 (8799) the name H8034 of the first H0259, Jemima H3224; and the name H8034 of the second H8145, Kezia H7103; and the name H8034 of the third H7992, Kerenhappuch H7163.
042:015 And in all the land H0776 were no women H0802 found H4672 (8738) [so] fair H3303 as the daughters H1323 of Job H0347: and their father H0001 gave H5414 (8799) them inheritance H5159 among H8432 their brethren H0251.
042:016 After H0310 this lived H2421 (8799) Job H0347 an hundred H3967 and forty H0705 years H8141, and saw H7200 (8799) his sons H1121, and his sons H1121 ’ sons H1121, [even] four H0702 generations H1755.
042:017 So Job H0347 died H4191 (8799), [being] old H2205 and full H7649 of days H3117.
