001:001 ¶  The former G3303 G4413 treatise G3056 have I made G4160 (AorMidInd), O G5599 Theophilus G2321, of G4012 all G3956 that G3739 Jesus G2424 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) both G5037 to do G4160 (PresActInf) and G2532 teach G1321 (PresActInf),
001:002 Until G0891 the day G2250 in which G3739 he was taken up G0353 (AorPasInd), after that he through G1223 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 had given commandments G1781 (AorMidPasDepPtc) unto the apostles G0652 whom G3739 he had chosen G1586 (AorMidInd):
001:003 To whom G3739 also G2532 he shewed G3936 (AorActInd) himself G1438 alive G2198 (PresActPtc) after G3326 his G0846 passion G3958 (Aor2ActInf) by G1722 many G4183 infallible proofs G5039, being seen G3700 (PresMidPasDepPtc) of them G0846 G1223 forty G5062 days G2250, and G2532 speaking G3004 (PresActPtc) of the things pertaining G4012 to the kingdom G0932 of God G2316:
001:004 And G2532, being assembled together G4871 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with G0846 [them], commanded G3853 (AorActInd) them G0846 that they should G5563 not G3361 depart G5563 (PresPasInf) from G0575 Jerusalem G2414, but G0235 wait G4037 (PresActInf) for the promise G1860 of the Father G3962, which G3739, [saith he], ye have heard G0191 (AorActInd) of me G3450.
001:005 For G3754 John G2491 truly G3303 baptized G0907 (AorActInd) with water G5204; but G1161 ye G5210 shall be baptized G0907 (FutPasInd) with G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 not G3756 many G3326 G4183 days G2250 hence G5025.
001:006 When G3303 they therefore G3767 were come together G4905 (Aor2ActPtc), they asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) of him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, G1487 wilt thou G0600 at G1722 this G5129 time G5550 restore again G0600 (PresActInd) the kingdom G0932 to Israel G2474?
001:007 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, It is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 for you G5216 to know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) the times G5550 or G2228 the seasons G2540, which G3739 the Father G3962 hath put G5087 (Aor2MidInd) in G1722 his own G2398 power G1849.
001:008 But G0235 ye shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) power G1411, after that the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 is come G1904 (Aor2ActPtc) upon G1909 you G5209: and G2532 ye shall be G2071 (FutInd) witnesses G3144 unto me G3427 both G5037 in G1722 Jerusalem G2419, and G2532 in G1722 all G3956 Judaea G2449, and G2532 in Samaria G4540, and G2532 unto G2193 the uttermost part G2078 of the earth G1093.
001:009 And G2532 when he had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) these things G5023, while they G0846 beheld G0991 (PresActPtc), he was taken up G1869 (AorPasInd); and G2532 a cloud G3507 received G5274 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 out of G0575 their G0846 sight G3788.
001:010 And G2532 while G5613 they looked stedfastly G2258 (ImpfInd) G0816 (PresActPtc) toward G1519 heaven G3772 as he G0846 went up G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc), G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), two G1417 men G0435 stood by G3936 (PlupfActInd) them G0846 in G1722 white G3022 apparel G2066;
001:011 Which G3739 also G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Ye men G0435 of Galilee G1057, why G5101 stand ye G2476 (PerfActInd) gazing up G1689 (PresActPtc) into G1519 heaven G3772? this same G3778 Jesus G2424, which G3588 is taken up G0353 (AorPasPtc) from G0575 you G5216 into G1519 heaven G3772, shall G2064 so G3779 come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) in like manner as G3739 G5158 ye have seen G2300 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 heaven G3772.
001:012 Then G5119 returned they G5290 (AorActInd) unto G1519 Jerusalem G2419 from G0575 the mount G3735 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Olivet G1638, which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) from G1451 Jerusalem G2419 a sabbath G4521 day’s journey G2192 (PresActPtc) G3598.
001:013 And G2532 when G3753 they were come in G1525 (Aor2ActInd), they went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 an upper room G5253, where G3757 abode G2258 (ImpfInd) G2650 (PresActPtc) both G5037 Peter G4074, and G2532 James G2385, and G2532 John G2491, and G2532 Andrew G0406, Philip G5376, and G2532 Thomas G2381, Bartholomew G0918, and G2532 Matthew G3156, James G2385 [the son] of Alphaeus G0256, and G2532 Simon G4613 Zelotes G2208, and G2532 Judas G2455 [the brother] of James G2385.
001:014 These G3778 all G3956 continued G2258 (ImpfInd) G4342 (PresActPtc) with one accord G3661 in prayer G4335 and G2532 supplication G1162, with G4862 the women G1135, and G2532 Mary G3137 the mother G3384 of Jesus G2424, and G2532 with G4862 his G0846 brethren G0080.
001:015 And G2532 in G1722 those G5025 days G2250 Peter G4074 stood up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) in G1722 the midst G3319 of the disciples G3101, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), G5037 (the number G3793 of names G3686 together G1909 G0846 were G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5613 an hundred G1540 and twenty G1501,)
001:016 Men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, this G5026 scripture G1124 must G1163 (ImpfInd) needs have been fulfilled G4137 (AorPasInf), which G3739 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 by G1223 the mouth G4750 of David G1138 spake before G4277 (Aor2ActInd) concerning G4012 Judas G2455, which G3588 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) guide G3595 to them that took G4815 (Aor2ActPtc) Jesus G2424.
001:017 For G3754 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) numbered G2674 (PerfPasPtc) with G4862 us G2254, and G2532 had obtained G2975 (Aor2ActInd) part G2819 of this G5026 ministry G1248.
001:018 Now G3303 G3767 this man G3778 purchased G2932 (AorMidDepInd) a field G5564 with G1537 the reward G3408 of iniquity G0093; and G2532 falling G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) headlong G4248, he burst asunder G2997 (AorActInd) in the midst G3319, and G2532 all G3956 his G0846 bowels G4698 gushed out G1632 (AorPasInd).
001:019 And G2532 it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) known G1110 unto all G3956 the dwellers G2730 (PresActPtc) at Jerusalem G2419; insomuch as G5620 that G1565 field G5564 is called G2564 (AorPasInf) in their G0846 proper G2398 tongue G1258, Aceldama G0184, that is to say G5123 (PresInd), The field G5564 of blood G0129.
001:020 For G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 the book G0976 of Psalms G5568, Let G1096 his G0846 habitation G1886 be G1096 (AorPasDepImpr) desolate G2048, and G2532 let G2077 (PresImpr) no man G3361 dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) therein G1722 G0846: and G2532 his G0846 bishoprick G1984 let G2983 another G2087 take G2983 (Aor2ActOpt).
001:021 Wherefore G3767 of these G5130 men G0435 which have companied G4905 (Aor2ActPtc) with us G2254 all G3956 the time G5550 that G1722 G3739 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 went G1831 in G1525 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) among G1909 us G2248,
001:022 Beginning G0756 (AorMidPtc) from G0575 the baptism G0908 of John G2491, unto G2193 that same day G2250 that G3739 he was taken up G0353 (AorPasInd) from G0575 us G2257, must G1163 (PresInd) one G1520 be ordained G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) to be a witness G3144 with G4862 us G2254 of his G0846 resurrection G0386.
001:023 And G2532 they appointed G2476 (Aor2ActInd) two G1417, Joseph G2501 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Barsabas G0923, who G3739 was surnamed G1941 (AorPasInd) Justus G2459, and G2532 Matthias G3159.
001:024 And G2532 they prayed G4336 (AorMidDepPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Thou G4771, Lord G2962, which knowest the hearts G2589 of all G3956 [men], shew G0322 (AorActImpr) whether G3739 G1520 of G1537 these G5130 two G1417 thou hast chosen G1586 (AorMidInd),
001:025 That he may take G2983 (Aor2ActInf) part G2819 of this G5026 ministry G1248 and G2532 apostleship G0651, from G1537 which G3739 Judas G2455 by transgression fell G3845 (Aor2ActInd), that he might go G4198 (AorPasDepInf) to G1519 his own G2398 place G5117.
001:026 And G2532 they gave forth G1325 (AorActInd) their G0846 lots G2819; and G2532 the lot G2819 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 Matthias G3159; and G2532 he was numbered G4785 (AorPasInd) with G3326 the eleven G1733 apostles G0652.
002:001 ¶  And G2532 when G1722 the day G2250 of Pentecost G4005 was fully come G4845 (PresPasInf), they were G2258 (ImpfInd) all G0537 with one accord G3661 in G1909 one place G0846.
002:002 And G2532 suddenly G0869 there came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a sound G2279 from G1537 heaven G3772 as G5618 of a rushing G5342 (PresMidPasPtc) mighty G0972 wind G4157, and G2532 it filled G4137 (AorActInd) all G3650 the house G3624 where G3757 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
002:003 And G2532 there appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) unto them G0846 cloven G1266 (PresMidPasPtc) tongues G1100 like as G5616 of fire G4442, and G5037 it sat G2523 (AorActInd) upon G1909 each G1538 G1520 of them G0846.
002:004 And G2532 they were G4130 all G0537 filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, and G2532 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to speak with G2980 (PresActInf) other G2087 tongues G1100, as G2531 the Spirit G4151 gave G1325 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 utterance G0669 (PresMidPasDepInf).
002:005 And G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) dwelling G2730 (PresActPtc) at G1722 Jerusalem G2419 Jews G2453, devout G2126 men G0435, out of G0575 every G3956 nation G1484 under G5259 heaven G3772.
002:006 Now G1161 when this G5026 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) noised abroad G5456, the multitude G4128 came together G4905 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 were confounded G4797 (AorPasInd), because G3754 that every G1538 man G1520 heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 speak G2980 (PresActPtc) in his own G2398 language G1258.
002:007 And G1161 they were G1839 all G3956 amazed G1839 (ImpfMidInd) and G2532 marvelled G2296 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc) one to another G4314 G0240, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), are G1526 (PresInd) not G3756 all G3956 these G3778 which G3588 speak G2980 (PresActPtc) Galilaeans G1057?
002:008 And G2532 how G4459 hear G0191 (PresActInd) we G2249 every G1538 man in our G2257 own G2398 tongue G1258, wherein G1722 G3739 we were born G1080 (AorPasInd)?
002:009 Parthians G3934, and G2532 Medes G3370, and G2532 Elamites G1639, and G2532 the dwellers G2730 (PresActPtc) in Mesopotamia G3318, and G5037 in Judaea G2449, and G2532 Cappadocia G2587, in Pontus G4195, and G2532 Asia G0773,
002:010 G5037 Phrygia G5435, and G5037 G2532 Pamphylia G3828, in Egypt G0125, and G2532 in the parts G3313 of Libya G3033 about G2596 Cyrene G2957, and G2532 strangers G1927 (PresActPtc) of Rome G4514, G5037 Jews G2453 and G5037 G2532 proselytes G4339,
002:011 Cretes G2912 and G2532 Arabians G0690, we do hear G0191 (PresActInd) them G0846 speak G2980 (PresActPtc) in our G2251 tongues G1100 the wonderful works G3167 of God G2316.
002:012 And G1161 they were G1839 all G3956 amazed G1839 (ImpfMidInd), and G2532 were in doubt G1280 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc) one G0243 to G4314 another G0243, What G5101 meaneth G2309 (PresActOpt) G0302 G1511 (PresInf) this G5124?
002:013 G1161 Others G2087 mocking G5512 (PresActPtc) said G3004 (ImpfActInd), G3754 These men are G1526 (PresInd) full G3325 (PerfPasPtc) of new wine G1098.
002:014 But G1161 Peter G4074, standing up G2476 (AorPasPtc) with G4862 the eleven G1733, lifted up G1869 (AorActInd) his G0846 voice G5456, and G2532 said G0669 (AorMidDepInd) unto them G0846, Ye men G0435 of Judaea G2453, and G2532 all G0537 [ye] that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) at Jerusalem G2419, be G2077 (PresImpr) this G5124 known G1110 unto you G5213, and G2532 hearken G1801 (AorMidDepImpr) to my G3450 words G4487:
002:015 For G1063 these G3778 are G3184 not G3756 drunken G3184 (PresActInd), as G5613 ye G5210 suppose G5274 (PresActInd), seeing G1063 it is G2076 (PresInd) [but] the third G5154 hour G5610 of the day G2250.
002:016 But G0235 this G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) that which was spoken G2046 (PerfPasPtc) by G1223 the prophet G4396 Joel G2493;
002:017 And G2532 it shall come to pass G2071 (FutInd) in G1722 the last G2078 days G2250, saith G3004 (PresActInd) God G2316, I will pour out G1632 (FutActInd) of G0575 my G3450 Spirit G4151 upon G1909 all G3956 flesh G4561: and G2532 your G5216 sons G5207 and G2532 your G5216 daughters G2364 shall prophesy G4395 (FutActInd), and G2532 your G5216 young men G3495 shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) visions G3706, and G2532 your G5216 old men G4245 shall dream G1797 (FutPasInd) dreams G1798:
002:018 And G2532 G1065 on G1909 my G3450 servants G1401 and G2532 on G1909 my G3450 handmaidens G1399 I will pour out G1632 (FutActInd) in G1722 those G1565 days G2250 of G0575 my G3450 Spirit G4151; and G2532 they shall prophesy G4395 (FutActInd):
002:019 And G2532 I will shew G1325 (FutActInd) wonders G5059 in G1722 heaven G3772 above G0507, and G2532 signs G4592 in G1909 the earth G1093 beneath G2736; blood G0129, and G2532 fire G4442, and G2532 vapour G0822 of smoke G2586:
002:020 The sun G2246 shall be turned G3344 (Fut2PasInd) into G1519 darkness G4655, and G2532 the moon G4582 into G1519 blood G0129, before G2228 G4250 that great G3173 and G2532 notable G2016 day G2250 of the Lord G2962 come G2064 (Aor2ActInf):
002:021 And G2532 it shall come to pass G2071 (FutInd), [that] whosoever G3739 G3956 G0302 shall call on G1941 (AorMidSubj) the name G3686 of the Lord G2962 shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd).
002:022 Ye men G0435 of Israel G2475, hear G0191 (AorActImpr) these G5128 words G3056; Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480, a man G0435 approved G0584 (PerfPasPtc) of G0575 God G2316 among G1519 you G5209 by miracles G1411 and G2532 wonders G5059 and G2532 signs G4592, which G3739 God G2316 did G4160 (AorActInd) by G1223 him G0846 in G1722 the midst G3319 of you G5216, as G2531 ye yourselves G0846 also G2532 know G1492 (PerfActInd):
002:023 Him G5126, being delivered G1560 by the determinate G3724 (PerfPasPtc) counsel G1012 and G2532 foreknowledge G4268 of God G2316, ye have taken G2983 (Aor2ActPtc), and by G1223 wicked G0459 hands G5495 have crucified G4362 (AorActPtc) and slain G0337 (Aor2ActInd):
002:024 Whom G3739 God G2316 hath raised up G0450 (AorActInd), having loosed G3089 (AorActPtc) the pains G5604 of death G2288: because G2530 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3756 possible G1415 that he G0846 should be holden G2902 (PresPasInf) of G5259 it G0846.
002:025 For G1063 David G1138 speaketh G3004 (PresActInd) concerning G1519 him G0846, I foresaw G4308 (ImpfMidInd) the Lord G2962 always G1223 G3956 before G1799 my G3450 face, for G3754 he is G2076 (PresInd) on G1537 my G3450 right hand G1188, that G3363 I should G4531 not G3363 be moved G4531 (AorPasSubj):
002:026 Therefore G1223 G5124 did G2165 my G3450 heart G2588 rejoice G2165 (AorPasInd), and G2532 my G3450 tongue G1100 was glad G0021 (AorMidDepInd); moreover G1161 G2089 also G2532 my G3450 flesh G4561 shall rest G2681 (FutActInd) in G1909 hope G1680:
002:027 Because G3754 thou wilt G1459 not G3756 leave G1459 (FutActInd) my G3450 soul G5590 in G1519 hell G0086, neither G3761 wilt thou suffer G1325 (FutActInd) thine G4675 Holy One G3741 to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) corruption G1312.
002:028 Thou hast made known G1107 (AorActInd) to me G3427 the ways G3598 of life G2222; thou shalt make G4137 me G3165 full G4137 (FutActInd) of joy G2167 with G3326 thy G4675 countenance G4383.
002:029 Men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, let G2036 me G1832 (PresPtc) freely G3326 G3954 speak G2036 (Aor2ActInf) unto G4314 you G5209 of G4012 the patriarch G3966 David G1138, that G3754 he is G5053 both G2532 dead G5053 (AorActInd) and G2532 buried G2290 (Aor2PasDepSubj), and G2532 his G0846 sepulchre G3418 is G2076 (PresInd) with G1722 us G2254 unto G0891 this G5026 day G2250.
002:030 Therefore G3767 being G5225 (PresActPtc) a prophet G4396, and G2532 knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 God G2316 had sworn G3660 (AorActInd) with an oath G3727 to him G0846, that of G1537 the fruit G2590 of his G0846 loins G3751, according to G2596 the flesh G4561, he would raise up G0450 (FutActInf) Christ G5547 to sit G2523 (AorActInf) on G1909 his G0846 throne G2362;
002:031 He seeing this before G4275 (Aor2ActPtc) spake G2980 (AorActInd) of G4012 the resurrection G0386 of Christ G5547, that G3754 his G0846 soul G5590 was G2641 not G3756 left G2641 (AorPasInd) in G1519 hell G0086, neither G3761 his G0846 flesh G4561 did see G1492 (Aor2ActInd) corruption G1312.
002:032 This G5126 Jesus G2424 hath G0450 God G2316 raised up G0450 (AorActInd), whereof G3739 we G2249 all G3956 are G2070 (PresInd) witnesses G3144.
002:033 Therefore G3767 being G5312 by the right hand G1188 of God G2316 exalted G5312 (AorPasPtc), and G5037 having received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) of G3844 the Father G3962 the promise G1860 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, he hath shed forth G1632 (AorActInd) this G5124, which G3739 ye G5210 now G3568 see G0991 (PresActInd) and G2532 hear G0191 (PresActInd).
002:034 For G1063 David G1138 is not G3756 ascended G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the heavens G3772: but G1161 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) himself G0846, The LORD G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto my G3450 Lord G2962, Sit thou G2521 (PresMidPasDepImpr) on G1537 my G3450 right hand G1188,
002:035 Until G2193 I make G0302 G5087 (Aor2ActSubj) thy G4675 foes G2190 thy G4675 footstool G4228 G5286.
002:036 Therefore G3767 let G1097 all G3956 the house G3624 of Israel G2474 know G1097 (PresActImpr) assuredly G0806, that G3754 God G2316 hath made G4160 (AorActInd) that same G5126 Jesus G2424, whom G3739 ye G5210 have crucified G4717 (AorActInd), both G2532 Lord G2962 and G2532 Christ G5547.
002:037 Now G1161 when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [this], they were pricked G2660 (Aor2PasDepSubj) in their heart G2588, and G5037 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 Peter G4074 and G2532 to the rest G3062 of the apostles G0652, Men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, what G5101 shall we do G4160 (FutActInd)?
002:038 Then G1161 Peter G4074 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Repent G3340 (AorActImpr), and G2532 be baptized G0907 (AorPasImpr) every one G1538 of you G5216 in G1909 the name G3686 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 for G1519 the remission G0859 of sins G0266, and G2532 ye shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) the gift G1431 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
002:039 For G1063 the promise G1860 is G2076 (PresInd) unto you G5213, and G2532 to your G5216 children G5043, and G2532 to all G3956 that are afar off G1519 G3112, [even] as many as G3745 the Lord G2962 our G2257 God G2316 shall call G0302 G4341 (AorMidDepSubj).
002:040 And G5037 with many G4119 other G2087 words G3056 did he testify G1263 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) and G2532 exhort G3870 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Save yourselves G4982 (AorPasImpr) from G0575 this G5026 untoward G4646 generation G1074.
002:041 Then G3303 G3767 they that gladly G0780 received G0588 (AorMidDepPtc) his G0846 word G3056 were baptized G0907 (AorPasInd): and G2532 the same G1565 day G2250 there were added G4369 (AorPasInd) [unto them] about G5616 three thousand G5153 souls G5590.
002:042 And G1161 they continued G2258 (ImpfInd) stedfastly G4342 (PresActPtc) in the apostles G0652 ’ doctrine G1322 and G2532 fellowship G2842, and G2532 in breaking G2800 of bread G0740, and G2532 in prayers G4335.
002:043 And G1161 fear G5401 came upon G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) every G3956 soul G5590: and G5037 many G4183 wonders G5059 and G2532 signs G4592 were done G1096 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) by G1223 the apostles G0652.
002:044 And G1161 all G3956 that believed G4100 (PresActPtc) were G2258 (ImpfInd) together G1909 G0846, and G2532 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) all things G0537 common G2839;
002:045 And G2532 sold G4097 (ImpfActInd) their possessions G2933 and G2532 goods G5223, and G2532 parted G1266 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 to all G3956 [men], as G2530 every man G5100 had G0302 G2192 (ImpfActInd) need G5532.
002:046 And G5037 they, continuing G4342 (PresActPtc) daily G2596 G2250 with one accord G3661 in G1722 the temple G2411, and G5037 breaking G2806 (PresActPtc) bread G0740 from G2596 house to house G3624, did eat G3335 (ImpfActInd) their meat G5160 with G1722 gladness G0020 and G2532 singleness G0858 of heart G2588,
002:047 Praising G0134 (PresActPtc) God G2316, and G2532 having G2192 (PresActPtc) favour G5485 with G4314 all G3650 the people G2992. And G1161 the Lord G2962 added G4369 (ImpfActInd) to the church G1577 daily G2596 G2250 such as should be saved G4982 (PresPasPtc).
003:001 ¶  Now G1161 Peter G4074 and G2532 John G2491 went up G0305 (ImpfActInd) together G1909 G0846 into G1519 the temple G2411 at the hour G5610 of prayer G4335, [being] the ninth G1766 [hour].
003:002 And G2532 a certain G5100 man G0435 lame G5225 (PresActPtc) G5560 from G1537 his G0846 mother’s G3384 womb G2836 was carried G0941 (ImpfPasInd), whom G3739 they laid G5087 (ImpfActInd) daily G2250 G2596 at G4314 the gate G2374 of the temple G2411 which G3588 is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Beautiful G5611, to ask G0154 (PresActInf) alms G1654 of G3844 them that entered G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 the temple G2411;
003:003 Who G3739 seeing G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) Peter G4074 and G2532 John G2491 about G3195 (PresActPtc) to go G1524 (PresInf) into G1519 the temple G2411 asked G2065 (ImpfActInd) G2983 (Aor2ActInf) an alms G1654.
003:004 And G1161 Peter G4074, fastening his eyes G0816 (AorActPtc) upon G1519 him G0846 with G4862 John G2491, said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Look G0991 (AorActImpr) on G1519 us G2248.
003:005 And G1161 he gave heed G1907 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, expecting G4328 (PresActPtc) to receive G2983 (Aor2ActInf) something G5100 of G3844 them G0846.
003:006 Then G1161 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Silver G0694 and G2532 gold G5553 have G5225 (PresActInd) I G3427 none G3756; but G1161 such as G3739 G5124 I have G2192 (PresActInd) give I G1325 (PresActInd) thee G4671: In G1722 the name G3686 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 of Nazareth G3480 rise up G1453 (AorMidImpr) and G2532 walk G4043 (PresActImpr).
003:007 And G2532 he took G4084 (AorActPtc) him G0846 by the right G1188 hand G5495, and lifted [him] up G1453 (AorActInd): and G1161 immediately G3916 his G0846 feet G0939 and G2532 ankle bones G4974 received strength G4732 (AorPasInd).
003:008 And G2532 he leaping up G1814 (PresMidPasDepPtc) stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 walked G4043 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) with G4862 them G0846 into G1519 the temple G2411, walking G4043 (PresActPtc), and G2532 leaping G0242 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 praising G0134 (PresActPtc) God G2316.
003:009 And G2532 all G3956 the people G2992 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 walking G4043 (PresActPtc) and G2532 praising G0134 (PresActPtc) God G2316:
003:010 And G5037 they knew G1921 (ImpfActInd) that G3754 it G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) he G3778 which G3588 sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) for G4314 alms G1654 at G1909 the Beautiful G5611 gate G4439 of the temple G2411: and G2532 they were filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with wonder G2285 and G2532 amazement G1611 at G1909 that which had happened G4819 (PerfActPtc) unto him G0846.
003:011 And G1161 as the lame man G5560 which was healed G2390 (AorPasPtc) held G2902 (PresActPtc) Peter G4074 and G2532 John G2491, all G3956 the people G2992 ran together G4936 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846 in G1909 the porch G4745 that is called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Solomon’s G4672, greatly wondering G1569.
003:012 And G1161 when Peter G4074 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) unto G4314 the people G2992, Ye men G0435 of Israel G2475, why G5101 marvel ye G2296 (PresActInd) at G1909 this G5129? or G2228 why G5101 look ye so earnestly G0816 (PresActInd) on us G2254, as though G5613 by our own G2398 power G1411 or G2228 holiness G2150 we had made G4160 (PerfActPtc) this man G0846 to walk G4043 (PresActInf)?
003:013 The God G2316 of Abraham G0011, and G2532 of Isaac G2464, and G2532 of Jacob G2384, the God G2316 of our G2257 fathers G3962, hath glorified G1392 (AorActInd) his G0846 Son G3816 Jesus G2424; whom G3739 ye G5210 delivered up G3860 (AorActInd), and G2532 denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846 in G2596 the presence G4383 of Pilate G4091, when he was determined G2919 (AorActPtc) to let G0630 [him] G1565 go G0630 (PresActInf).
003:014 But G1161 ye G5210 denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) the Holy One G0040 and G2532 the Just G1342, and G2532 desired G0154 (AorMidInd) a murderer G5406 G0435 to be granted G5483 (AorPasInf) unto you G5213;
003:015 And G1161 killed G0615 (AorActInd) the Prince G0747 of life G2222, whom G3739 God G2316 hath raised G1453 (AorActInd) from G1537 the dead G3498; whereof G3739 we G2249 are G2070 (PresInd) witnesses G3144.
003:016 And G2532 his G0846 name G3686 through G1909 faith G4102 in his G0846 name G3686 hath made G4732 this man G5026 strong G4732 (AorActInd), whom G3739 ye see G2334 (PresActInd) and G2532 know G1492 (PerfActInd): yea G2532, the faith G4102 which is G1325 by G1223 him G0846 hath given G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 this G5126 perfect soundness G3647 in the presence G0561 of you G5216 all G3956.
003:017 And G2532 now G3568, brethren G0080, I wot G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 through G2596 ignorance G0052 ye did G4238 (AorActInd) [it], as G5618 [did] also G2532 your G5216 rulers G0758.
003:018 But G1161 those things, which G3739 God G2316 before had shewed G4293 (AorActInd) by G1223 the mouth G4750 of all G3956 his G0846 prophets G4396, that Christ G5547 should suffer G3958 (Aor2ActInf), he hath G4137 so G3779 fulfilled G4137 (AorActInd).
003:019 Repent ye G3340 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767, and G2532 be converted G1994 (AorActImpr), that G1519 your G5216 sins G0266 may be blotted out G1813 (AorPasInf), when G3704 the times G2540 of refreshing G0403 shall come G0302 G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) from G0575 the presence G4383 of the Lord G2962;
003:020 And G2532 he shall send G0649 (AorActSubj) Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, which before was preached G4296 (PerfPasPtc) unto you G5213:
003:021 Whom G3739 the heaven G3772 G3303 must G1163 (PresInd) receive G1209 (AorMidDepInf) until G0891 the times G5550 of restitution G0605 of all things G3956, which G3739 God G2316 hath spoken G2980 (AorActInd) by G1223 the mouth G4750 of all G3956 his G0846 holy G0040 prophets G4396 since G0575 the world began G0165.
003:022 For G1063 Moses G3475 truly G3303 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the fathers G3962, G3754 A prophet G4396 shall G0450 the Lord G2962 your G5216 God G2316 raise up G0450 (FutActInd) unto you G5213 of G1537 your G5216 brethren G0080, like G5613 unto me G1691; him G0846 shall ye hear G0191 (FutMidDepInd) in G2596 all things G3956 whatsoever G3745 G0302 he shall say G2980 (AorActSubj) unto G4314 you G5209.
003:023 And G1161 it shall come to pass G2071 (FutInd), [that] every G3956 soul G5590, which G3748 G0302 will G0191 not G3361 hear G0191 (AorActSubj) that G1565 prophet G4396, shall be destroyed G1842 (FutPasInd) from among G1537 the people G2992.
003:024 Yea G2532, and G1161 all G3956 the prophets G4396 from G0575 Samuel G4545 and G2532 those that follow after G2517, as many as G3745 have spoken G2980 (AorActInd), have G4293 likewise G2532 foretold G4293 (AorActInd) of these G5025 days G2250.
003:025 Ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) the children G5207 of the prophets G4396, and G2532 of the covenant G1242 which G3739 God G2316 made G1303 (Aor2MidInd) with G4314 our G2257 fathers G3962, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto G4314 Abraham G0011, And G2532 in thy G4675 seed G4690 shall G1757 all G3956 the kindreds G3965 of the earth G1093 be blessed G1757 (FutPasInd).
003:026 Unto you G5213 first G4412 God G2316, having raised up G0450 (AorActPtc) his G0846 Son G3816 Jesus G2424, sent G0649 (AorActInd) him G0846 to bless G2127 (PresActPtc) you G5209, in G1722 turning away G0654 (PresActInf) every one G1538 of you G5216 from G0575 his iniquities G4189.
004:001 ¶  And G1161 as they G0846 spake G2980 (PresActPtc) unto G4314 the people G2992, the priests G2409, and G2532 the captain G4755 of the temple G2411, and G2532 the Sadducees G4523, came upon G2186 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846,
004:002 Being grieved G1278 (PresMidPasDepPtc) that G1223 they G0846 taught G1321 (PresActInf) the people G2992, and G2532 preached G2605 (PresActInf) through G1722 Jesus G2424 the resurrection G0386 from G1537 the dead G3498.
004:003 And G2532 they laid G1911 (Aor2ActInd) hands G5495 on them G0846, and G2532 put G5087 (Aor2MidInd) [them] in G1519 hold G5084 unto G1519 the next day G0839: for G1063 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) now G2235 eventide G2073.
004:004 Howbeit G1161 many G4183 of them which heard G0191 (AorActPtc) the word G3056 believed G4100 (AorActInd); and G2532 the number G0706 of the men G0435 was G1096 (AorPasDepInd) about G5616 five G4002 thousand G5505.
004:005 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) on G1909 the morrow G0839, that their G0846 rulers G0758, and G2532 elders G4245, and G2532 scribes G1122,
004:006 And G2532 Annas G0452 the high priest G0749, and G2532 Caiaphas G2533, and G2532 John G2491, and G2532 Alexander G0223, and G2532 as many as G3745 were G2258 (ImpfInd) of G1537 the kindred G1085 of the high priest G0748, were gathered together G4863 (AorPasInf) at G1519 Jerusalem G2419.
004:007 And G2532 when they had set G2476 (AorActPtc) them G0846 in G1722 the midst G3319, they asked G4441 (ImpfMidPasDepInd), By G1722 what G4169 power G1411, or G2228 by G1722 what G4169 name G3686, have G4160 ye G5210 done G4160 (AorActInd) this G5124?
004:008 Then G5119 Peter G4074, filled G4130 (AorPasPtc) with the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Ye rulers G0758 of the people G2992, and G2532 elders G4245 of Israel G2474,
004:009 If G1487 we G2249 this day G4594 be examined G0350 (PresPasInd) of G1909 the good deed done G2108 to the impotent G0772 man G0444, by G1722 what means G5101 he G3778 is made whole G4982 (PerfPasInd);
004:010 Be it G2077 (PresImpr) known G1110 unto you G5213 all G3956, and G2532 to all G3956 the people G2992 of Israel G2474, that G3754 by G1722 the name G3686 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 of Nazareth G3480, whom G3739 ye G5210 crucified G4717 (AorActInd), whom G3739 God G2316 raised G1453 (AorActInd) from G1537 the dead G3498, [even] by G1722 him G5129 doth G3936 this man G3778 stand here G3936 (PerfActInd) before G1799 you G5216 whole G5199.
004:011 This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the stone G3037 which G3588 was set at nought G1848 (AorPasPtc) of G5259 you G5216 builders G3618 (PresActPtc), which G3588 is become G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) the head G2776 of G1519 the corner G1137.
004:012 Neither G2532 G3756 is there G2076 (PresInd) salvation G4991 in G1722 any G3762 other G0243: for G1063 there is G2076 (PresInd) none G3777 other G2087 name G3686 under G5259 heaven G3772 given G1325 (PerfPasPtc) among G1722 men G0444, whereby G1722 G3739 we G2248 must G1163 (PresInd) be saved G4982 (AorPasInf).
004:013 Now G1161 when they saw G2334 (PresActPtc) the boldness G3954 of Peter G4074 and G2532 John G2491, and G2532 perceived G2638 (Aor2MidPtc) that G3754 they were G1526 (PresInd) unlearned G0062 and G2532 ignorant G2399 men G0444, they marvelled G2296 (ImpfActInd); and G5037 they took knowledge G1921 (ImpfActInd) of them G0846, that G3754 they had been G2258 (ImpfInd) with G4862 Jesus G2424.
004:014 And G1161 beholding G0991 (PresActPtc) the man G0444 which was healed G2323 (PerfPasPtc) standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) with G4862 them G0846, they could G2192 (ImpfActInd) say G0471 nothing G3762 against it G0471 (Aor2ActInf).
004:015 But G1161 when they had commanded G2753 (AorActPtc) them G0846 to go aside G0565 (Aor2ActInf) out of G1854 the council G4892, they conferred G4820 (Aor2ActInd) among G4314 themselves G0240,
004:016 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 shall we do G4160 (FutActInd) to these G5125 men G0444? for G1063 that G3754 indeed G3303 a notable G1110 miracle G4592 hath been done G1096 (Perf2ActInd) by G1223 them G0846 [is] manifest G5318 to all them G3956 that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) in Jerusalem G2419; and G2532 we cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) deny G0720 (AorMidDepInf) [it].
004:017 But G0235 that G3363 it spread G1268 (AorPasSubj) no G3363 further G1909 G4119 among G1519 the people G2992, let us straitly G0547 threaten G0546 (AorMidSubj) them G0846, that they speak G2980 (PresActInf) henceforth G3371 to no G3367 man G0444 in G1909 this G5129 name G3686.
004:018 And G2532 they called G2564 (AorActPtc) them G0846, and commanded G3853 (AorActInd) them G0846 not G3361 to speak G5350 (PresMidPasDepInf) at all G2527 nor G3366 teach G1321 (PresActInf) in G1909 the name G3686 of Jesus G2424.
004:019 But G1161 Peter G4074 and G2532 John G2491 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Whether G1487 it be G2076 (PresInd) right G1342 in the sight G1799 of God G2316 to hearken G0191 (PresActInf) unto you G5216 more than G3123 G2228 unto God G2316, judge ye G2919 (AorActImpr).
004:020 For G1063 we G2249 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) but G3361 speak G2980 (PresActInf) the things which G3739 we have seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActInd).
004:021 So G1161 when they had further threatened them G4324 (AorMidPtc), they let G0630 them G0846 go G0630 (AorActInd), finding G2147 (PresActPtc) nothing G3367 how G4459 they might punish G2849 (AorMidSubj) them G0846, because G1223 of the people G2992: for G3754 all G3956 [men] glorified G1392 (ImpfActInd) God G2316 for G1909 that which was done G1096 (Perf2ActPtc).
004:022 For G1063 the man G0444 was G2258 (ImpfInd) above G4119 forty G5062 years old G2094, on G1909 whom G3739 this G5124 miracle G4592 of healing G2392 was shewed G1096 (PlupfActInd).
004:023 And G1161 being let go G0630 (AorPasPtc), they went G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 their own company G2398, and G2532 reported G0518 (AorActInd) all G3745 that the chief priests G0749 and G2532 elders G4245 had said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846.
004:024 And G1161 when they heard that G0191 (AorActPtc), they lifted up G0142 (AorActInd) their voice G5456 to G4314 God G2316 with one accord G3661, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G1203, thou G4771 [art] God G2316, which G3588 hast made G4160 (AorActPtc) heaven G3772, and G2532 earth G1093, and G2532 the sea G2281, and G2532 all G3956 that in G1722 them is G0846:
004:025 Who G3588 by G1223 the mouth G4750 of thy G4675 servant G3816 David G1138 hast said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), Why G2444 did G5433 the heathen G1484 rage G5433 (AorActInd), and G2532 the people G2992 imagine G3191 (AorActInd) vain things G2756?
004:026 The kings G0935 of the earth G1093 stood up G3936 (AorActInd), and G2532 the rulers G0758 were gathered G4863 (AorPasInd) together G1909 G0846 against G2596 the Lord G2962, and G2532 against G2596 his G0846 Christ G5547.
004:027 For G1063 of G1909 a truth G0225 against G1909 thy G4675 holy G0040 child G3816 Jesus G2424, whom G3739 thou hast anointed G5548 (AorActInd), both G5037 Herod G2264, and G2532 Pontius G4194 Pilate G4091, with G4862 the Gentiles G1484, and G2532 the people G2992 of Israel G2474, were gathered together G4863 (AorPasInd),
004:028 For to do G4160 (AorActInf) whatsoever G3745 thy G4675 hand G5495 and G2532 thy G4675 counsel G1012 determined before G4309 (AorActInd) to be done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf).
004:029 And G2532 now G3569, Lord G2962, behold G1896 (Aor2ActImpr) G1909 their G0846 threatenings G0547: and G2532 grant unto G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) thy G4675 servants G1401, that with G3326 all G3956 boldness G3954 they may speak G2980 (PresActInf) thy G4675 word G3056,
004:030 By G1722 G4571 stretching forth G1614 (PresActInf) thine G4675 hand G5495 to G1519 heal G2392; and G2532 that signs G4592 and G2532 wonders G5059 may be done G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf) by G1223 the name G3686 of thy G4675 holy G0040 child G3816 Jesus G2424.
004:031 And G2532 when they G0846 had prayed G1189 (AorPasDepPtc), the place G5117 was shaken G4531 (AorPasInd) where G1722 G3739 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) assembled together G4863 (PerfPasPtc); and G2532 they were G4130 all G0537 filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, and G2532 they spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) the word G3056 of God G2316 with G3326 boldness G3954.
004:032 And G1161 the multitude G4128 of them that believed G4100 (AorActPtc) were G2258 (ImpfInd) of one heart G2588 and G2532 of one G3391 soul G5590: neither G2532 G3761 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) any G1520 [of them] that ought G5100 of the things which he G0846 possessed G5224 (PresActPtc) was G1511 (PresInf) his own G2398; but G0235 they G0846 had G2258 (ImpfInd) all things G0537 common G2839.
004:033 And G2532 with great G3173 power G1411 gave G0591 (ImpfActInd) the apostles G0652 witness G3142 of the resurrection G0386 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424: and G5037 great G3173 grace G5485 was G2258 (ImpfInd) upon G1909 them G0846 all G3956.
004:034 Neither G3761 G1063 was G5225 (ImpfActInd) there any G5100 among G1722 them G0846 that lacked G1729: for G1063 as many as G3745 were G5225 (ImpfActInd) possessors G2935 of lands G5564 or G2228 houses G3614 sold them G4453 (PresActPtc), and brought G5342 (ImpfActInd) the prices G5092 of the things that were sold G4097 (PresPasPtc),
004:035 And G2532 laid [them] down G5087 (ImpfActInd) at G3844 the apostles G0652 ’ feet G4228: and G1161 distribution was made G1239 (ImpfPasInd) unto every man G1538 according G2530 as G0302 he had G2192 (ImpfActInd) need G5100 G5532.
004:036 And G1161 Joses G2500, who G3588 by G5259 the apostles G0652 was surnamed G1941 (AorPasPtc) Barnabas G0921, (which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd), being interpreted G3177 (PresPasPtc), The son G5207 of consolation G3874,) a Levite G3019, [and] of the country G1085 of Cyprus G2953,
004:037 Having G5225 (PresActPtc) G0846 land G0068, sold G4453 (AorActPtc) [it], and brought G5342 (AorActInd) the money G5536, and G2532 laid G5087 (AorActInd) [it] at G3844 the apostles G0652 ’ feet G4228.
005:001 ¶  But G1161 a certain G5100 man G0435 named G3686 Ananias G0367, with G4862 Sapphira G4551 his G0846 wife G1135, sold G4453 (AorActInd) a possession G2933,
005:002 And G2532 kept back G3557 (AorMidInd) [part] of G0575 the price G5092, his G0846 wife G1135 also G2532 being privy G4894 (PerfActPtc) [to it], and G2532 brought G5342 (AorActPtc) a certain G5100 part G3313, and laid G5087 (AorActInd) [it] at G3844 the apostles G0652 ’ feet G4228.
005:003 But G1161 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Ananias G0367, why G1302 hath Satan G4567 filled G4137 (AorActInd) thine G4675 heart G2588 G4571 to lie G5574 (AorMidDepInf) to the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, and G2532 to keep back G3557 (AorMidInf) [part] of G0575 the price G5092 of the land G5564?
005:004 Whiles it remained G3306 (PresActPtc), was it not G3780 thine own G4671 G3306 (ImpfActInd)? and G2532 after it was sold G4097 (AorPasPtc), was it not G5225 (ImpfActInd) in G1722 thine own G4674 power G1849? why G5101 G3754 hast thou conceived G5087 (Aor2MidInd) this G5124 thing G4229 in G1722 thine G4675 heart G2588? thou hast G5574 not G3756 lied G5574 (AorMidDepInd) unto men G0444, but G0235 unto God G2316.
005:005 And G1161 Ananias G0367 hearing G0191 (PresActPtc) these G5128 words G3056 fell down G4098 (Aor2ActPtc), and gave up the ghost G1634 (AorActInd): and G2532 great G3173 fear G5401 came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) on G1909 all G3956 them that heard G0191 (PresActPtc) these things G5023.
005:006 And G1161 the young men G3501 arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), wound G4958 him G0846 up G4958 (AorActInd), and G2532 carried [him] out G1627 (AorActPtc), and buried G2290 (AorActInd) [him].
005:007 And G1161 it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) about G5613 the space G1292 of three G5140 hours G5610 after G1292, when G2532 his G0846 wife G1135, not G3361 knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) what was done G1096 (Perf2ActPtc), came in G1525 (Aor2ActInd).
005:008 And G1161 Peter G4074 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) unto her G0846, Tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427 whether G1487 ye sold G0591 (Aor2MidInd) the land G5564 for so much G5118? And G1161 she said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Yea G3483, for so much G5118.
005:009 Then G1161 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 her G0846, How G5101 is it that G3754 ye G5213 have agreed together G4856 (AorPasInd) to tempt G3985 (AorActInf) the Spirit G4151 of the Lord G2962? behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the feet G4228 of them which have buried G2290 (AorActPtc) thy G4675 husband G0435 [are] at G1909 the door G2374, and G2532 shall carry G1627 thee G4571 out G1627 (FutActInd).
005:010 Then G1161 fell she down G4098 (Aor2ActInd) straightway G3916 at G3844 his G0846 feet G4228, and G2532 yielded up the ghost G1634 (AorActInd): and G1161 the young men G3495 came in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc), and found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846 dead G3498, and G2532, carrying [her] forth G1627 (AorActPtc), buried G2290 (AorActInd) [her] by G4314 her G0846 husband G0435.
005:011 And G2532 great G3173 fear G5401 came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) upon G1909 all G3650 the church G1577, and G2532 upon G1909 as many as G3956 heard G0191 (PresActPtc) these things G5023.
005:012 And G1161 by G1223 the hands G5495 of the apostles G0652 were G1096 many G4183 signs G4592 and G2532 wonders G5059 wrought G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) G1096 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) among G1722 the people G2992; (and G2532 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) all G0537 with one accord G3661 in G1722 Solomon’s G4672 porch G4745.
005:013 And G1161 of the rest G3062 durst G5111 (ImpfActInd) no man G3762 join himself G2853 (PresPasInf) to them G0846: but G0235 the people G2992 magnified G3170 (ImpfActInd) them G0846.
005:014 And G1161 believers G4100 (PresActPtc) were G4369 the more G3123 added G4369 (ImpfPasInd) to the Lord G2962, multitudes G4128 both G5037 of men G0435 and G2532 women G1135.)
005:015 Insomuch G5620 that they brought forth G1627 (PresActInf) the sick G0772 into G2596 the streets G4113, and G2532 laid G5087 (PresActInf) [them] on G1909 beds G2825 and G2532 couches G2895, that G2443 at the least G2579 the shadow G4639 of Peter G4074 passing by G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) might overshadow G1982 (AorActSubj) some G5100 of them G0846.
005:016 G1161 There came G4905 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) also G2532 a multitude G4128 [out] of the cities G4172 round about G4038 unto G1519 Jerusalem G2419, bringing G5342 (PresActPtc) sick G0772 folks, and G2532 them which were vexed G3791 (PresPasPtc) with G5259 unclean G0169 spirits G4151: and they G3748 were healed G2323 (ImpfPasInd) every one G0537.
005:017 Then G1161 the high priest G0749 rose up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 all they G3956 that were with G4862 him G0846, (which G3588 is G5607 (PresPtc) the sect G0139 of the Sadducees G4523,) and were filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with indignation G2205,
005:018 And G2532 laid G1911 (Aor2ActInd) their G0846 hands G5495 on G1909 the apostles G0652, and G2532 put G5087 (Aor2MidInd) them G0846 in G1722 the common G1219 prison G5084.
005:019 But G1161 the angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 by G1223 night G3571 opened G0455 (AorActInd) the prison G5438 doors G2374, and G5037 brought G1806 them G0846 forth G1806 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd),
005:020 Go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr), stand G2476 (AorPasPtc) and G2532 speak G2980 (PresActImpr) in G1722 the temple G2411 to the people G2992 all G3956 the words G4487 of this G5026 life G2222.
005:021 And G1161 when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [that], they entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the temple G2411 early in the morning G5259 G3722, and G2532 taught G1321 (ImpfActInd). But G1161 the high priest G0749 came G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc), and G2532 they that were with G4862 him G0846, and called G4779 the council G4892 together G4779 (AorActInd), and G2532 all G3956 the senate G1087 of the children G5207 of Israel G2474, and G2532 sent G0649 (AorActInd) to G1519 the prison G1201 to have G0071 them G0846 brought G0071 (AorPasInf).
005:022 But G1161 when the officers G5257 came G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc), and found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 not G3756 in G1722 the prison G5438, they returned G0390 (AorActPtc), and G1161 told G0518 (AorActInd),
005:023 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 The prison G1201 truly G3303 found we G2147 (Aor2ActInd) shut G2808 (PerfPasPtc) with G1722 all G3956 safety G0803, and G2532 the keepers G5441 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) without G1854 before G4253 the doors G2374: but G1161 when we had opened G0455 (AorActPtc), we found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) no man G3762 within G2080.
005:024 Now G1161 when G5613 G5037 the high priest G2409 and G2532 the captain G4755 of the temple G2411 and G2532 the chief priests G0749 heard G0191 (AorActInd) these G5128 things G3056, they doubted G1280 (ImpfActInd) of G4012 them G0846 whereunto G5101 G0302 this G5124 would grow G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt).
005:025 Then came G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) one G5100 and G1161 told G0518 (AorActInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the men G0435 whom G3739 ye put G5087 (Aor2MidInd) in G1722 prison G5438 are G1526 (PresInd) standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, and G2532 teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) the people G2992.
005:026 Then G5119 went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) the captain G4755 with G4862 the officers G5257, and brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 without G3756 G3326 violence G0970: for G1063 they feared G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) the people G2992, lest G3363 they should have been stoned G3034 (AorPasSubj).
005:027 And G1161 when they had brought G0071 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846, they set G2476 (Aor2ActInd) [them] before G1722 the council G4892: and G2532 the high priest G0749 asked G1905 (AorActInd) them G0846,
005:028 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Did G3853 not G3756 we straitly G3852 command G3853 (AorActInd) you G5213 that ye should G1321 not G3361 teach G1321 (PresActInf) in G1909 this G5129 name G3686? and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), ye have filled G4137 (PerfActInd) Jerusalem G2419 with your G5216 doctrine G1322, and G2532 intend G1014 (PresMidPasDepInd) to bring G1863 (Aor2ActInf) this G5127 man’s G0444 blood G0129 upon G1909 us G2248.
005:029 Then G1161 Peter G4074 and G2532 the [other] apostles G0652 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), We ought G1163 (PresInd) to obey G3980 (PresActInf) God G2316 rather G3123 than G2228 men G0444.
005:030 The God G2316 of our G2257 fathers G3962 raised up G1453 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424, whom G3739 ye G5210 slew G1315 (AorMidInd) and hanged G2910 (AorActPtc) on G1909 a tree G3586.
005:031 Him G5126 hath God G2316 exalted G5312 (AorActInd) with his G0846 right hand G1188 [to be] a Prince G0747 and G2532 a Saviour G4990, for to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) repentance G3341 to Israel G2474, and G2532 forgiveness G0859 of sins G0266.
005:032 And G2532 we G2249 are G2070 (PresInd) his G0846 witnesses G3144 of these G5130 things G4487; and G2532 [so is] also G1161 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, whom G3739 God G2316 hath given G1325 (AorActInd) to them that obey G3980 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
005:033 When G1161 they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [that], they were cut G1282 (ImpfPasInd) [to the heart], and G2532 took counsel G1011 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to slay G0337 (Aor2ActInf) them G0846.
005:034 Then G1161 stood there up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) one G5100 in G1722 the council G4892, a Pharisee G5330, named G3686 Gamaliel G1059, a doctor of the law G3547, had in reputation G5093 among all G3956 the people G2992, and commanded G2753 (AorActInd) to put G4160 (AorActInf) the apostles G0652 forth G1854 a G5100 little space G1024;
005:035 And G5037 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Ye men G0435 of Israel G2475, take heed G4337 (PresActImpr) to yourselves G1438 what G5101 ye intend G3195 (PresActInd) to do G4238 (PresActInf) as touching G1909 these G5125 men G0444.
005:036 For G1063 before G4253 these G5130 days G2250 rose up G0450 (Aor2ActInd) Theudas G2333, boasting G3004 (PresActPtc) himself G1438 to be G1511 (PresInf) somebody G5100; to whom G3739 a number G0706 of men G0435, about G5616 four hundred G5071, joined themselves G4347 (AorPasInd): who G3739 was slain G0337 (AorPasInd); and G2532 all G3956, as many as G3745 obeyed G3982 (ImpfPasInd) him G0846, were scattered G1262 (AorPasInd), and G2532 brought G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) to G1519 nought G3762.
005:037 After G3326 this man G5126 rose up G0450 (Aor2ActInd) Judas G2455 of Galilee G1057 in G1722 the days G2250 of the taxing G0582, and G2532 drew away G0868 (AorActInd) much G2425 people G2992 after G3694 him G0846: he also G2548 perished G0622 (Aor2MidInd); and G2532 all G3956, [even] as many as G3745 obeyed G3982 (ImpfPasInd) him G0846, were dispersed G1287 (AorPasInd).
005:038 And G2532 now G3569 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Refrain G0868 (Aor2ActImpr) from G0575 these G5130 men G0444, and G2532 let G1439 them G0846 alone G1439 (AorActImpr): for G3754 if G1437 this G3778 counsel G1012 or G2228 this G5124 work G2041 be G5600 (PresSubj) of G1537 men G0444, it will come to nought G2647 (FutPasInd):
005:039 But G1161 if G1487 it be G2076 (PresInd) of G1537 God G2316, ye cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) overthrow G2647 (AorActInf) it G0846; lest haply G3379 ye be found G2147 (AorPasSubj) even G2532 to fight against God G2314.
005:040 And G1161 to him G0846 they agreed G3982 (AorPasInd): and G2532 when they had called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) the apostles G0652, and beaten G1194 (AorActPtc) [them], they commanded G3853 (AorActInd) that they should G2980 not G3361 speak G2980 (PresActInf) in G1909 the name G3686 of Jesus G2424, and G2532 let G0630 them G0846 go G0630 (AorActInd).
005:041 And G3767 they departed G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) G3303 from G0575 the presence G4383 of the council G4892, rejoicing G5463 (PresActPtc) that G3754 they were counted worthy G2661 (AorPasInd) to suffer shame G0818 (AorPasInf) for G5228 his G0846 name G3686.
005:042 And G5037 daily G2250 G3956 in G1722 the temple G2411, and G2532 in every G2596 house G3624, they ceased G3973 (ImpfMidInd) not G3756 to teach G1321 (PresActPtc) and G2532 preach G2097 (PresMidPtc) Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
006:001 ¶  And G1161 in G1722 those G5025 days G2250, when the number G4129 of the disciples G3101 was multiplied G4129 (PresActPtc), there arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a murmuring G1112 of the Grecians G1675 against G4314 the Hebrews G1445, because G3754 their G0846 widows G5503 were neglected G3865 (ImpfPasInd) in G1722 the daily G2522 ministration G1248.
006:002 Then G1161 the twelve G1427 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) the multitude G4128 of the disciples G3101 [unto them], and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), It is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 reason G0701 that we G2248 should leave G2641 (AorActPtc) the word G3056 of God G2316, and serve G1247 (PresActInf) tables G5132.
006:003 Wherefore G3767, brethren G0080, look ye out G1980 (AorMidDepImpr) among G1537 you G5216 seven G2033 men G0435 of honest report G3140 (PresPasPtc), full G4134 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 and G2532 wisdom G4678, whom G3739 we may appoint G2525 (FutActInd) over G1909 this G5026 business G5532.
006:004 But G1161 we G2249 will give ourselves continually G4342 (FutActInd) to prayer G4335, and G2532 to the ministry G1248 of the word G3056.
006:005 And G2532 the saying G3056 pleased G0700 (AorActInd) G1799 the whole G3956 multitude G4128: and G2532 they chose G1586 (AorMidInd) Stephen G4736, a man G0435 full G4134 of faith G4102 and G2532 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, and G2532 Philip G5376, and G2532 Prochorus G4402, and G2532 Nicanor G3527, and G2532 Timon G5096, and G2532 Parmenas G3937, and G2532 Nicolas G3532 a proselyte G4339 of Antioch G0491:
006:006 Whom G3739 they set G2476 (Aor2ActInd) before G1799 the apostles G0652: and G2532 when they had prayed G4336 (AorMidDepPtc), they laid G2007 [their] hands G5495 on G2007 (AorActInd) them G0846.
006:007 And G2532 the word G3056 of God G2316 increased G0837 (ImpfActInd); and G2532 the number G0706 of the disciples G3101 multiplied G4129 (ImpfPasInd) in G1722 Jerusalem G2419 greatly G4970; and G5037 a great G4183 company G3793 of the priests G2409 were obedient G5219 (ImpfActInd) to the faith G4102.
006:008 And G1161 Stephen G4736, full G4134 of faith G4102 and G2532 power G1411, did G4160 (ImpfActInd) great G3173 wonders G5059 and G2532 miracles G4592 among G1722 the people G2992.
006:009 Then G1161 there arose G0450 (AorActInd) certain G5100 of G1537 the synagogue G4864, which G3588 is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) [the synagogue] of the Libertines G3032, and G2532 Cyrenians G2956, and G2532 Alexandrians G0221, and G2532 of them of G0575 Cilicia G2791 and G2532 of Asia G0773, disputing G4802 (PresActPtc) with Stephen G4736.
006:010 And G2532 they were G2480 not G3756 able G2480 (ImpfActInd) to resist G0436 (Aor2ActInf) the wisdom G4678 and G2532 the spirit G4151 by which G3739 he spake G2980 (ImpfActInd).
006:011 Then G5119 they suborned G5260 (Aor2ActInd) men G0435, which said G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 We have heard G0191 (Perf2ActInd) him G0846 speak G2980 (PresActPtc) blasphemous G0989 words G4487 against G1519 Moses G3475, and G2532 [against] God G2316.
006:012 And G5037 they stirred up G4787 (AorActInd) the people G2992, and G2532 the elders G4245, and G2532 the scribes G1122, and G2532 came upon G2186 (Aor2ActPtc) [him], and caught G4884 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) [him] to G1519 the council G4892,
006:013 And G5037 set up G2476 (Aor2ActInd) false G5571 witnesses G3144, which said G3004 (PresActPtc), This G5127 man G0444 ceaseth G3973 (PresMidInd) not G3756 to speak G2980 (PresActPtc) blasphemous G0989 words G4487 against G2596 this G3778 holy G0040 place G5117, and G2532 the law G3551:
006:014 For G1063 we have heard G0191 (Perf2ActInd) him G0846 say G3004 (PresActPtc), that G3754 this G5126 Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480 shall destroy G2647 (FutActInd) this G3778 place G5117, and G2532 shall change G0236 (FutActInd) the customs G1485 which G3739 Moses G3475 delivered G3860 (AorActInd) us G2254.
006:015 And G2532 all G0537 that sat G2516 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the council G4892, looking stedfastly G0816 (AorActPtc) on G1519 him G0846, saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 face G4383 as it had been G5616 the face G4383 of an angel G0032.
007:001 ¶  Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the high priest G0749, Are G1487 G0686 G2192 (PresActInd) these things G5023 so G3779?
007:002 And G1161 he said G5346 (ImpfInd), Men G0435, brethren G0080, and G2532 fathers G3962, hearken G0191 (AorActImpr); The God G2316 of glory G1391 appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) unto our G2257 father G3962 Abraham G0011, when he was G5607 (PresPtc) in G1722 Mesopotamia G3318, before G4250 G2228 he G0846 dwelt G2730 (AorActInf) in G1722 Charran G5488,
007:003 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Get thee G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) out of G1537 thy G4675 country G1093, and G2532 from G1537 thy G4675 kindred G4772, and G2532 come G1204 (Impr) into G1519 the land G1093 which G3739 G0302 I shall shew G1166 (FutActInd) thee G4671.
007:004 Then G5119 came he G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G1537 the land G1093 of the Chaldaeans G5466, and dwelt G2730 (AorActInd) in G1722 Charran G5488: and from thence G2547, when G3326 his G0846 father G3962 was dead G0599 (Aor2ActInf), he removed G3351 (AorActInd) him G0846 into G1519 this G5026 land G1093, wherein G1519 G3739 ye G5210 now G3568 dwell G2730 (PresActInd).
007:005 And G2532 he gave G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 none G3756 inheritance G2817 in G1722 it G0846, no, not G3761 [so much as] to set G0968 his foot G4228 on G0968: yet G2532 he promised G1861 (AorMidDepInd) that he would give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) it G0846 to him G0846 for G1519 a possession G2697, and G2532 to his G0846 seed G4690 after G3326 him G0846, when [as yet] he G0846 had G5607 (PresPtc) no G3756 child G5043.
007:006 And G1161 God G2316 spake G2980 (AorActInd) on this wise G3779, That G3754 his G0846 seed G4690 should G2071 (FutInd) sojourn G3941 in G1722 a strange G0245 land G1093; and G2532 that they should bring G1402 them G0846 into bondage G1402 (FutActInd), and G2532 entreat [them] evil G2559 (FutActInd) four hundred G5071 years G2094.
007:007 And G2532 the nation G1484 to whom G3739 G1437 they shall be in bondage G1398 (AorActSubj) will G2919 I G1473 judge G2919 (FutActInd), said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) God G2316: and G2532 after G3326 that G5023 shall they come forth G1831 (FutMidDepInd), and G2532 serve G3000 (FutActInd) me G3427 in G1722 this G5129 place G5117.
007:008 And G2532 he gave G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 the covenant G1242 of circumcision G4061: and G2532 so G3779 [Abraham] begat G1080 (AorActInd) Isaac G2464, and G2532 circumcised G4059 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 the eighth G3590 day G2250; and G2532 Isaac G2464 [begat] Jacob G2384; and G2532 Jacob G2384 [begat] the twelve G1427 patriarchs G3966.
007:009 And G2532 the patriarchs G3966, moved with envy G2206 (AorActPtc), sold G0591 (Aor2MidInd) Joseph G2501 into G1519 Egypt G0125: but G2532 God G2316 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 him G0846,
007:010 And G2532 delivered G1807 (Aor2MidInd) him G0846 out of G1537 all G3956 his G0846 afflictions G2347, and G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 favour G5485 and G2532 wisdom G4678 in the sight G1726 of Pharaoh G5328 king G0935 of Egypt G0125; and G2532 he made G2525 (AorActInd) him G0846 governor G2233 (PresMidPasDepPtc) over G1909 Egypt G0125 and G2532 all G3650 his G0846 house G3624.
007:011 Now G1161 there came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) a dearth G3042 over G1909 all G3650 the land G1093 of Egypt G0125 and G2532 Chanaan G5477, and G2532 great G3173 affliction G2347: and G2532 our G2257 fathers G3962 found G2147 (ImpfActInd) no G3756 sustenance G5527.
007:012 But G1161 when Jacob G2384 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that there was G5607 (PresPtc) corn G4621 in G1722 Egypt G0125, he sent out G1821 (AorActInd) our G2257 fathers G3962 first G4412.
007:013 And G2532 at G1722 the second G1208 [time] Joseph G2501 was made known G0319 (AorPasInd) to his G0846 brethren G0080; and G2532 Joseph’s G2501 kindred G1085 was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) known G5318 unto Pharaoh G5328.
007:014 Then G1161 sent G0649 (AorActPtc) Joseph G2501, and called G3333 (AorMidInd) his G0846 father G3962 Jacob G2384 to [him], and G2532 all G3956 his G0846 kindred G4772, G1722 threescore G1440 and fifteen G4002 souls G5590.
007:015 So G1161 Jacob G2384 went down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Egypt G0125, and G2532 died G5053 (AorActInd), he G0846, and G2532 our G2257 fathers G3962,
007:016 And G2532 were carried over G3346 (AorPasInd) into G1519 Sychem G4966, and G2532 laid G5087 (AorPasInd) in G1722 the sepulchre G3418 that G3739 Abraham G0011 bought G5608 (AorMidDepInd) for a sum G5092 of money G0694 of G3844 the sons G5207 of Emmor G1697 [the father G3588 ] of Sychem G4966.
007:017 But G1161 when G2531 the time G5550 of the promise G1860 drew nigh G1448 (ImpfActInd), which G3739 God G2316 had sworn G3660 (AorActInd) to Abraham G0011, the people G2992 grew G0837 (AorActInd) and G2532 multiplied G4129 (AorPasInd) in G1722 Egypt G0125,
007:018 Till G0891 G3739 another G2087 king G0935 arose G0450 (Aor2ActInd), which G3739 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756 Joseph G2501.
007:019 The same G3778 dealt subtilly G2686 (AorMidDepPtc) with our G2257 kindred G1085, and evil entreated G2559 (AorActInd) our G2257 fathers G3962, so that G4160 (PresActInf) they cast out G1570 their G0846 young children G1025, to the end G1519 they might G2225 not G3361 live G2225 (PresPasInf).
007:020 In G1722 which G3739 time G2540 Moses G3475 was born G1080 (AorPasInd), and G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) exceeding G2316 fair G0791, and G3739 nourished up G0397 (Aor2PasDepSubj) in G1722 his G0846 father’s G3962 house G3624 three G5140 months G3376:
007:021 And G1161 when he G0846 was cast out G1620 (AorPasPtc), Pharaoh’s G5328 daughter G2364 took G0337 him G0846 up G0337 (Aor2MidInd), and G2532 nourished G0397 (AorMidInd) him G0846 for G1519 her own G1438 son G5207.
007:022 And G2532 Moses G3475 was learned G3811 (AorPasInd) in all G3956 the wisdom G4678 of the Egyptians G0124, and G1161 was G2258 (ImpfInd) mighty G1415 in G1722 words G3056 and G2532 in G1722 deeds G2041.
007:023 And G1161 when G5613 he G0846 was full G4137 (ImpfPasInd) forty years G5063 old G5550, it came G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1909 his G0846 heart G2588 to visit G1980 (AorMidDepInf) his G0846 brethren G0080 the children G5207 of Israel G2474.
007:024 And G2532 seeing G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) one G5100 [of them] suffer wrong G0091 (PresPasPtc), he defended G0292 (AorMidDepInd) [him], and G2532 avenged G1557 G4160 (AorActInd) him that was oppressed G2669 (PresPasPtc), and smote G3960 (AorActPtc) the Egyptian G0124:
007:025 For G1161 he supposed G3543 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 brethren G0080 would have understood G4920 (PresActInf) how G3754 that God G2316 by G1223 his G0846 hand G5495 would deliver G1325 (PresActInd) G4991 them G0846: but G1161 they understood G4920 (AorActInd) not G3756.
007:026 And G5037 the next G1966 (PresPtc) day G2250 he shewed himself G3700 (AorPasInd) unto them G0846 as they strove G3164 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 would have set G4900 (AorActInd) them G0846 at G1519 one again G1515, saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), Sirs G0435, ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) brethren G0080; why G2444 do ye wrong G0091 (PresActInd) one to another G0240?
007:027 But G1161 he that did G0091 his neighbour G4139 wrong G0091 (PresActPtc) thrust G0683 him G0846 away G0683 (AorMidDepInd), saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), Who G5101 made G2525 (AorActInd) thee G4571 a ruler G0758 and G2532 a judge G1348 over G1909 us G2248?
007:028 Wilt G3361 G2309 (PresActInd) thou G4771 kill G0337 (Aor2ActInf) me G3165, as G3739 G5158 thou diddest G0337 (Aor2ActInd) the Egyptian G0124 yesterday G5504?
007:029 Then G1161 fled G5343 (Aor2ActInd) Moses G3475 at G1722 this G5129 saying G3056, and G2532 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a stranger G3941 in G1722 the land G1093 of Madian G3099, where G3757 he begat G1080 (AorActInd) two G1417 sons G5207.
007:030 And G2532 when forty G5062 years G2094 were expired G4137 (AorPasPtc), there appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) to him G0846 in G1722 the wilderness G2048 of mount G3735 Sina G4614 an angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 in G1722 a flame G5395 of fire G4442 in a bush G0942.
007:031 When G1161 Moses G3475 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he wondered G2296 (AorActInd) at the sight G3705: and G1161 as he G0846 drew near G4334 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to behold G2657 (AorActInf) [it], the voice G5456 of the Lord G2962 came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846,
007:032 [Saying], I G1473 [am] the God G2316 of thy G4675 fathers G3962, the God G2316 of Abraham G0011, and G2532 the God G2316 of Isaac G2464, and G2532 the God G2316 of Jacob G2384. Then G1161 Moses G3475 trembled G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) G1790, and durst G5111 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 behold G2657 (AorActInf).
007:033 Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the Lord G2962 to him G0846, Put off G3089 (AorActImpr) thy shoes G5266 from thy G4675 feet G4228: for G1063 the place G5117 where G1722 G3739 thou standest G2476 (PerfActInd) is G2076 (PresInd) holy G0040 ground G1093.
007:034 I have seen G1492 (Aor2ActPtc), I have seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the affliction G2561 of my G3450 people G2992 which G3588 is in G1722 Egypt G0125, and G2532 I have heard G0191 (AorActInd) their G0846 groaning G4726, and G2532 am come down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) to deliver G1807 (Aor2MidInf) them G0846. And G2532 now G3568 come G1204 (Impr), I will send G0649 (FutActInd) thee G4571 into G1519 Egypt G0125.
007:035 This G5126 Moses G3475 whom G3739 they refused G0720 (AorMidDepInd), saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), Who G5101 made G2525 (AorActInd) thee G4571 a ruler G0758 and G2532 a judge G1348? the same G5126 did God G2316 send G0649 (AorActInd) [to be] a ruler G0758 and G2532 a deliverer G3086 by G1722 the hand G5495 of the angel G0032 which G3588 appeared G3700 (AorPasPtc) to him G0846 in G1722 the bush G0942.
007:036 He G3778 brought G1806 them G0846 out G1806 (Aor2ActInd), after that he had shewed G4160 (AorActPtc) wonders G5059 and G2532 signs G4592 in G1722 the land G1093 of Egypt G0125, and G2532 in G1722 the Red G2063 sea G2281, and G2532 in G1722 the wilderness G2048 forty G5062 years G2094.
007:037 This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) that Moses G3475, which G3588 said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) unto the children G5207 of Israel G2474, A prophet G4396 shall G0450 the Lord G2962 your G5216 God G2316 raise up G0450 (FutActInd) unto you G5213 of G1537 your G5216 brethren G0080, like G5613 unto me G1691; him G0846 shall ye hear G0191 (FutMidDepInd).
007:038 This G3778 is he G2076 (PresInd), that was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) in G1722 the church G1577 in G1722 the wilderness G2048 with G3326 the angel G0032 which G3588 spake G2980 (PresActPtc) to him G0846 in G1722 the mount G3735 Sina G4614, and G2532 [with] our G2257 fathers G3962: who G3739 received G1209 (AorMidDepInd) the lively G2198 (PresActPtc) oracles G3051 to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) unto us G2254:
007:039 To whom G3739 our G2257 fathers G3962 would G2309 (AorActInd) not G3756 obey G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) G5255, but G0235 thrust [him] from them G0683 (AorMidDepInd), and G2532 in their G0846 hearts G2588 turned back again G4762 (Aor2PasDepSubj) into G1519 Egypt G0125,
007:040 Saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) unto Aaron G0002, Make G4160 (AorActImpr) us G2254 gods G2316 to G3739 go before G4313 (FutMidDepInd) us G2257: for G1063 [as for] this G3778 Moses G3475, which G3739 brought G1806 (Aor2ActInd) us G2248 out of G1537 the land G1093 of Egypt G0125, we wot G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 is become G1096 (Perf2ActInd) of him G0846.
007:041 And G2532 they made a calf G3447 (AorActInd) in G1722 those G1565 days G2250, and G2532 offered G0321 (Aor2ActInd) sacrifice G2378 unto the idol G1497, and G2532 rejoiced G2165 (ImpfPasInd) in G1722 the works G2041 of their own G0846 hands G5495.
007:042 Then G1161 God G2316 turned G4762 (AorActInd), and G2532 gave G3860 them G0846 up G3860 (AorActInd) to worship G3000 (PresActInf) the host G4756 of heaven G3772; as it G2531 is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 the book G0976 of the prophets G4396, O ye house G3624 of Israel G2474, have ye offered G3361 G4374 (AorActInd) to me G3427 slain beasts G4968 and G2532 sacrifices G2378 [by the space of] forty G5062 years G2094 in G1722 the wilderness G2048?
007:043 Yea G2532, ye took up G0353 (Aor2ActInd) the tabernacle G4633 of Moloch G3434, and G2532 the star G0798 of your G5216 god G2316 Remphan G4481, figures G5179 which G3739 ye made G4160 (AorActInd) to worship G4352 (PresActInf) them G0846: and G2532 I will carry G3351 you G5209 away G3351 (FutActInd) beyond G1900 Babylon G0897.
007:044 Our G2257 fathers G3962 had G2258 (ImpfInd) the tabernacle G4633 of witness G3142 G1722 in G1722 the wilderness G2048, as G2531 he had appointed G1299 (AorMidInd), speaking G2980 (PresActPtc) unto Moses G3475, that he should make G4160 (AorActInf) it G0846 according G2596 to the fashion G5179 that G3739 he had seen G3708 (PlupfActInd).
007:045 Which G3739 also G2532 our G2257 fathers G3962 that came G1237 (AorMidDepPtc) after brought in G1521 (Aor2ActInd) with G3326 Jesus G2424 into G1722 the possession G2697 of the Gentiles G1484, whom G3739 God G2316 drave out G1856 (AorActInd) before G0575 the face G4383 of our G2257 fathers G3962, unto G2193 the days G2250 of David G1138;
007:046 Who G3739 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) favour G5485 before G1799 God G2316, and G2532 desired G0154 (AorMidInd) to find G2147 (Aor2ActInf) a tabernacle G4638 for the God G2316 of Jacob G2384.
007:047 But G1161 Solomon G4672 built G3618 (AorActInd) him G0846 an house G3624.
007:048 Howbeit G0235 the most High G5310 dwelleth G2730 (PresActInd) not G3756 in G1722 temples G3485 made with hands G5499; as G2531 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the prophet G4396,
007:049 Heaven G3772 [is] my G3427 throne G2362, and G1161 earth G1093 [is] my G3450 footstool G4228 G5286: what G4169 house G3624 will ye build G3618 (FutActInd) me G3427? saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Lord G2962: or G2228 what G5101 [is] the place G5117 of my G3450 rest G2663?
007:050 Hath G4160 not G3780 my G3450 hand G5495 made G4160 (AorActInd) all G3956 these things G5023?
007:051 Ye stiffnecked G4644 and G2532 uncircumcised G0564 in heart G2588 and G2532 ears G3775, ye G5210 do G0496 always G0104 resist G0496 (PresActInd) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151: as G5613 your G5216 fathers G3962 [did], so G2532 [do] ye G5210.
007:052 Which G5101 of the prophets G4396 have G1377 not G3756 your G5216 fathers G3962 persecuted G1377 (AorActInd)? and G2532 they have slain G0615 (AorActInd) them which G3588 shewed before G4293 (AorActPtc) of G4012 the coming G1660 of the Just One G1342; of whom G3739 ye G5210 have been G1096 (PerfPasInd) now G3568 the betrayers G4273 and G2532 murderers G5406:
007:053 Who G3748 have received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the law G3551 by G1519 the disposition G1296 of angels G0032, and G2532 have G5442 not G3756 kept G5442 (AorActInd) [it].
007:054 When G1161 they heard G0191 (PresActPtc) these things G5023, they were cut G1282 (ImpfPasInd) to the heart G2588 G0846, and G2532 they gnashed G1031 (ImpfActInd) on G1909 him G0846 with [their] teeth G3599.
007:055 But G1161 he, being G5225 (PresActPtc) full G4134 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, looked up stedfastly G0816 (AorActPtc) into G1519 heaven G3772, and saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the glory G1391 of God G2316, and G2532 Jesus G2424 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) on G1537 the right hand G1188 of God G2316,
007:056 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I see G2334 (PresActInd) the heavens G3772 opened G0455 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 the Son G5207 of man G0444 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) on G1537 the right hand G1188 of God G2316.
007:057 Then G1161 they cried out G2896 (AorActPtc) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, and stopped G4912 (Aor2ActInd) their G0846 ears G3775, and G2532 ran G3729 (AorActInd) upon G1909 him G0846 with one accord G3661,
007:058 And G2532 cast G1544 (Aor2ActPtc) [him] out of G1854 the city G4172, and stoned G3036 (ImpfActInd) [him]: and G2532 the witnesses G3144 laid down G0659 (Aor2MidInd) their G0846 clothes G2440 at G3844 a young man’s G3494 feet G4228, whose name was G2564 (PresPasPtc) Saul G4569.
007:059 And G2532 they stoned G3036 (ImpfActInd) Stephen G4736, calling upon G1941 (PresMidPtc) [God], and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962 Jesus G2424, receive G1209 (AorMidDepImpr) my G3450 spirit G4151.
007:060 And G1161 he kneeled down G5087 (Aor2ActPtc) G1119, and cried G2896 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, Lord G2962, lay G2476 (AorActSubj) not G3361 this G5026 sin G0266 to their G0846 charge. And G2532 when he had said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) this G5124, he fell asleep G2837 (AorPasInd).
008:001 ¶  And G1161 Saul G4569 was G2258 (ImpfInd) consenting G4909 (PresActPtc) unto his G0846 death G0336. And G1161 at G1722 that G1565 time G2250 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 persecution G1375 against G1909 the church G1577 which G3588 was at G1722 Jerusalem G2414; and G5037 they were G1289 all G3956 scattered abroad G1289 (AorPasInd) throughout G2596 the regions G5561 of Judaea G2449 and G2532 Samaria G4540, except G4133 the apostles G0652.
008:002 And G1161 devout G2126 men G0435 carried G4792 (AorActInd) Stephen G4736 [to his burial], and G2532 made G4160 (AorMidInd) great G3173 lamentation G2870 over G1909 him G0846.
008:003 As G1161 for Saul G4569, he made havock G3075 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) of the church G1577, entering into G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) every G2596 house G3624, and haling G4951 (PresActPtc) G5037 men G0435 and G2532 women G1135 committed G3860 (ImpfActInd) [them] to G1519 prison G5438.
008:004 Therefore G3767 G3303 they that were scattered abroad G1289 (Aor2PasPtc) went every where G1330 (Aor2ActInd) preaching G2097 (PresMidPtc) the word G3056.
008:005 Then G1161 Philip G5376 went down G2718 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 the city G4172 of Samaria G4540, and preached G2784 (ImpfActInd) Christ G5547 unto them G0846.
008:006 And G5037 the people G3793 with one accord G3661 gave heed G4337 (ImpfActInd) unto those things which Philip G5376 spake G3004 (PresPasPtc) G5259, hearing G1722 G0191 (PresActInf) G0846 and G2532 seeing G0991 (PresActInf) the miracles G4592 which G3739 he did G4160 (ImpfActInd).
008:007 For G1063 unclean G0169 spirits G4151, crying G0994 (PresActPtc) with loud G3173 voice G5456, came out G1831 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) of many G4183 that were possessed G2192 (PresActPtc) [with them]: and G1161 many G4183 taken with palsies G3886 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 that were lame G5560, were healed G2323 (AorPasInd).
008:008 And G2532 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) great G3173 joy G5479 in G1722 that G1565 city G4172.
008:009 But G1161 there was a certain G5100 man G0435, called G3686 Simon G4613, which beforetime G4391 (ImpfActInd) in G1722 the same city G4172 used sorcery G3096 (PresActPtc), and G2532 bewitched G1839 (PresActPtc) the people G1484 of Samaria G4540, giving out G3004 (PresActPtc) that himself G1438 was G1511 (PresInf) some G5100 great one G3173:
008:010 To whom G3739 they all G3956 gave heed G4337 (ImpfActInd), from G0575 the least G3398 to G2193 the greatest G3173, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This man G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the great G3173 power G1411 of God G2316.
008:011 And G1161 to him G0846 they had regard G4337 (ImpfActInd), because G1223 that of long G2425 time G5550 he had bewitched G1839 (PerfActInf) them G0846 with sorceries G3095.
008:012 But G1161 when G3753 they believed G4100 (AorActInd) Philip G5376 preaching G2097 (PresMidPtc) the things concerning G4012 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, and G2532 the name G3686 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, they were baptized G0907 (ImpfPasInd), both G5037 men G0435 and G2532 women G1135.
008:013 Then G1161 Simon G4613 himself G0846 believed G4100 (AorActInd) also G2532: and G2532 when he was baptized G0907 (AorPasPtc), he continued G2258 (ImpfInd) G4342 (PresActPtc) with Philip G5376, and G5037 wondered G1839 (ImpfMidInd), beholding G2334 (PresActPtc) the miracles G1411 and G2532 signs G4592 G3173 which were done G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
008:014 Now G1161 when the apostles G0652 which G3588 were at G1722 Jerusalem G2414 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 Samaria G4540 had received G1209 (PerfMidPasDepInd) the word G3056 of God G2316, they sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto G4314 them G0846 Peter G4074 and G2532 John G2491:
008:015 Who G3748, when they were come down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc), prayed G4336 (AorMidDepInd) for G4012 them G0846, that G3704 they might receive G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151:
008:016 (For G1063 as yet G3768 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) fallen G1968 (PerfActPtc) upon G1909 none G3762 of them G0846: only G3440 G1161 they were G5225 (ImpfActInd) baptized G0907 (PerfPasPtc) in G1519 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424.)
008:017 Then G5119 laid they G2007 (ImpfActInd) [their] hands G5495 on G1909 them G0846, and G2532 they received G2983 (ImpfActInd) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
008:018 And G1161 when Simon G4613 saw G2300 (AorMidDepPtc) that G3754 through G1223 laying on G1936 of the apostles G0652 ’ hands G5495 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 was given G1325 (PresPasInd), he offered G4374 (AorActInd) them G0846 money G5536,
008:019 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) me also G2504 this G5026 power G1849, that G2443 on G2007 whomsoever G3739 G1437 I lay G2007 (Aor2ActSubj) hands G5495, he may receive G2983 (PresActSubj) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
008:020 But G1161 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Thy G4675 money G0694 perish G1498 (PresOpt) G1519 G0684 with G4862 thee G4671, because G3754 thou hast thought G3543 (AorActInd) that the gift G1431 of God G2316 may be purchased G2932 (PresMidPasDepInf) with G1223 money G5536.
008:021 Thou G4671 hast G2076 (PresInd) neither G3756 part G3310 nor G3761 lot G2819 in G1722 this G5129 matter G3056: for G1063 thy G4675 heart G2588 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 right G2117 in the sight G1799 of God G2316.
008:022 Repent G3340 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767 of G0575 this G5026 thy G4675 wickedness G2549, and G2532 pray G1189 (AorPasDepImpr) God G2316, if G1487 perhaps G0686 the thought G1963 of thine G4675 heart G2588 may be forgiven G0863 (FutPasInd) thee G4671.
008:023 For G1063 I perceive G3708 (PresActInd) that thou G4571 art G5607 (PresPtc) in G1519 the gall G5521 of bitterness G4088, and G2532 [in] the bond G4886 of iniquity G0093.
008:024 Then G1161 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) Simon G4613, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Pray G1189 (AorPasDepImpr) ye G5210 to G4314 the Lord G2962 for G5228 me G1700, that G3704 none of these things G3367 which G3739 ye have spoken G2046 (PerfActInd) come G1904 (Aor2ActSubj) upon G1909 me G1691.
008:025 And they, when G3303 G3767 they had testified G1263 (AorMidDepPtc) and G2532 preached G2980 (AorActPtc) the word G3056 of the Lord G2962, returned G5290 (AorActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, and G5037 preached the gospel G2097 (AorMidInd) in many G4183 villages G2968 of the Samaritans G4541.
008:026 And G1161 the angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 spake G2980 (AorActInd) unto G4314 Philip G5376, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Arise G0450 (Aor2ActImpr), and G2532 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) toward G2596 the south G3314 unto G1909 the way G3598 that goeth down G2597 (PresActPtc) from G0575 Jerusalem G2419 unto G1519 Gaza G1048, which G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) desert G2048.
008:027 And G2532 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) and went G4198 (AorPasDepInd): and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a man G0435 of Ethiopia G0128, an eunuch G2135 of great authority G1413 under Candace G2582 queen G0938 of the Ethiopians G0128, who G3739 had G2258 (ImpfInd) the charge of G1909 all G3956 her G0846 treasure G1047, and G3739 had come G2064 (PlupfActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419 for to worship G4352 (FutActPtc),
008:028 G5037 Was G2258 (ImpfInd) returning G5290 (PresActPtc), and G2532 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1909 his G0846 chariot G0716 G2532 read G0314 (ImpfActInd) Esaias G2268 the prophet G4396.
008:029 Then G1161 the Spirit G4151 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto Philip G5376, Go near G4334 (Aor2ActImpr), and G2532 join thyself to G2853 (AorPasImpr) this G5129 chariot G0716.
008:030 And G1161 Philip G5376 ran G4370 (Aor2ActPtc) thither to [him], and heard G0191 (AorActInd) him G0846 read G0314 (PresActPtc) the prophet G4396 Esaias G2268, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Understandest thou G0687 G1065 G1097 (PresActInd) what G3739 thou readest G0314 (PresActInd)?
008:031 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), How G1063 G4459 can I G0302 G1410 (PresMidPasDepOpt), except G3362 some man G5100 should guide G3594 (AorActSubj) me G3165? And G5037 he desired G3870 (AorActInd) Philip G5376 that he would come up G0305 (Aor2ActPtc) and sit G2523 (AorActInf) with G4862 him G0846.
008:032 G1161 The place G4042 of the scripture G1124 which G3739 he read G0314 (ImpfActInd) was G2258 (ImpfInd) this G3778, He was led G0071 (AorPasInd) as G5613 a sheep G4263 to G1909 the slaughter G4967; and G2532 like G5613 a lamb G0286 dumb G0880 before G1726 his G0846 shearer G2751 (PresActPtc), so G3779 opened he G0455 (PresActInd) not G3756 his G0846 mouth G4750:
008:033 In G1722 his G0846 humiliation G5014 his G0846 judgment G2920 was taken away G0142 (AorPasInd): and G1161 who G5101 shall declare G1334 (FutMidDepInd) his G0846 generation G1074? for G3754 his G0846 life G2222 is taken G0142 (PresPasInd) from G0575 the earth G1093.
008:034 And G1161 the eunuch G2135 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) Philip G5376, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I pray G1189 (PresMidPasDepInd) thee G4675, of G4012 whom G5101 speaketh G3004 (PresActInd) the prophet G4396 this G5124? of G4012 himself G1438, or G2228 of G4012 some G5100 other man G2087?
008:035 Then G1161 Philip G5376 opened G0455 (AorActPtc) his G0846 mouth G4750, and G2532 began G0756 (AorMidPtc) at G0575 the same G5026 scripture G1124, and preached G2097 (AorMidInd) unto him G0846 Jesus G2424.
008:036 And G1161 as G5613 they went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) on G2596 [their] way G3598, they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1909 a certain G5100 water G5204: and G2532 the eunuch G2135 said G5346 (PresInd), See G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), [here is] water G5204; what G5101 doth hinder G2967 (PresActInd) me G3165 to be baptized G0907 (AorPasInf)?
008:037 And G1161 Philip G5376 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), If G1487 thou believest G4100 (PresActInd) with G1537 all thine G3650 heart G2588, thou mayest G1832 (PresInd). And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I believe G4100 (PresActInd) that Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 is G1511 (PresInf) the Son G5207 of God G2316.
008:038 And G2532 he commanded G2753 (AorActInd) the chariot G0716 to stand still G2476 (Aor2ActInf): and G2532 they went down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) both G0297 into G1519 the water G5204, both G5037 Philip G5376 and G2532 the eunuch G2135; and G2532 he baptized G0907 (AorActInd) him G0846.
008:039 And G1161 when G3753 they were come up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 the water G5204, the Spirit G4151 of the Lord G2962 caught away G0726 (AorActInd) Philip G5376, G2532 that the eunuch G2135 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) G3756 him G0846 no more G3765: and G1063 he went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) on his G0846 way G3598 rejoicing G5463 (PresActPtc).
008:040 But G1161 Philip G5376 was found G2147 (AorPasInd) at G1519 Azotus G0108: and G2532 passing G1330 (PresMidPasDepPtc) through he preached G2097 (ImpfMidInd) in all G3956 the cities G4172, till G2193 he G0846 came G2064 (Aor2ActInf) to G1519 Caesarea G2542.
009:001 ¶  And G1161 Saul G4569, yet G2089 breathing out G1709 (PresActPtc) threatenings G0547 and G2532 slaughter G5408 against G1519 the disciples G3101 of the Lord G2962, went G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) unto the high priest G0749,
009:002 And desired G0154 (AorMidInd) of G3844 him G0846 letters G1992 to G1519 Damascus G1154 to G4314 the synagogues G4864, that G3704 if G1437 he found G2147 (Aor2ActSubj) any G5100 of this way G3598, whether G5037 they were G5607 (PresPtc) men G0435 or G2532 women G1135, he might bring them G0071 (Aor2ActSubj) bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) unto G1519 Jerusalem G2419.
009:003 And G1161 as he G0846 journeyed G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) G1722, he came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) near G1448 (PresActInf) Damascus G1154: and G2532 suddenly G1810 there shined round about G4015 (AorActInd) him G0846 a light G5457 from G0575 heaven G3772:
009:004 And G2532 he fell G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1909 the earth G1093, and heard G0191 (AorActInd) a voice G5456 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, Saul G4549, Saul G4549, why G5101 persecutest thou G1377 (PresActInd) me G3165?
009:005 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Who G5101 art thou G1488 (PresInd), Lord G2962? And G1161 the Lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) Jesus G2424 whom G3739 thou G4771 persecutest G1377 (PresActInd): [it is] hard G4642 for thee G4671 to kick G2979 (PresActInf) against G4314 the pricks G2759.
009:006 And G5037 he trembling G5141 (PresActPtc) and G2532 astonished G2284 (PresActPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, what G5101 wilt thou have G2309 (PresActInd) me G3165 to do G4160 (AorActInf)? And G2532 the Lord G2962 [said] unto G4314 him G0846, Arise G0450 (Aor2ActImpr), and G2532 go G1525 (Aor2ActImpr) into G1519 the city G4172, and G2532 it shall be told G2980 (FutPasInd) thee G4671 what G5101 thou G4571 must G1163 (PresInd) do G4160 (PresActInf).
009:007 And G1161 the men G0435 which G3588 journeyed G4922 (PresActPtc) with him G0846 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) speechless G1769, hearing G0191 (PresActPtc) G3303 a voice G5456, but G1161 seeing G2334 (PresActPtc) no man G3367.
009:008 And G1161 Saul G4569 arose G1453 (AorPasInd) from G0575 the earth G1093; and G1161 when his G0846 eyes G3788 were opened G0455 (PerfPasPtc), he saw G0991 (ImpfActInd) no man G3762: but G1161 they led G5496 him G0846 by the hand G5496 (PresActPtc), and brought G1521 (Aor2ActInd) [him] into G1519 Damascus G1154.
009:009 And G2532 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) three G5140 days G2250 without G3361 sight G0991 (PresActPtc), and G2532 neither G3756 did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) nor G3761 drink G4095 (Aor2ActInd).
009:010 And G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a certain G5100 disciple G3101 at G1722 Damascus G1154, named G3686 Ananias G0367; and G2532 to G4314 him G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the Lord G2962 in G1722 a vision G3705, Ananias G0367. And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 [am here], Lord G2962.
009:011 And G1161 the Lord G2962 [said] unto G4314 him G0846, Arise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and go G4198 (AorPasDepImpr) into G1909 the street G4505 which G3588 is called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Straight G2117, and G2532 enquire G2212 (AorActImpr) in G1722 the house G3614 of Judas G2455 for [one] called G3686 Saul G4569, of Tarsus G5018: for G1063, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), he prayeth G4336 (PresMidPasDepInd),
009:012 And G2532 hath seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 a vision G3705 a man G0435 named G3686 Ananias G0367 coming in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 putting G2007 [his] hand G5495 on G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, that G3704 he might receive his sight G0308 (AorActSubj).
009:013 Then G1161 Ananias G0367 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Lord G2962, I have heard G0191 (Perf2ActInd) by G0575 many G4183 of G4012 this G5127 man G0435, how much G3745 evil G2556 he hath done G4160 (AorActInd) to thy G4675 saints G0040 at G1722 Jerusalem G2419:
009:014 And G2532 here G5602 he hath G2192 (PresActInd) authority G1849 from G3844 the chief priests G0749 to bind G1210 (AorActInf) all G3956 that call G1941 (PresMidPtc) on thy G4675 name G3686.
009:015 But G1161 the Lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Go thy way G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr): for G3754 he G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) a chosen G1589 vessel G4632 unto me G3427, to bear G0941 (AorActInf) my G3450 name G3686 before G1799 the Gentiles G1484, and G2532 kings G0935, and G5037 the children G5207 of Israel G2474:
009:016 For G1063 I G1473 will shew G5263 (FutActInd) him G0846 how great things G3745 he G0846 must G1163 (PresInd) suffer G3958 (Aor2ActInf) for G5228 my G3450 name’s sake G3686 G5228.
009:017 And G1161 Ananias G0367 went his way G0565 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the house G3614; and G2532 putting G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) his hands G5495 on G1909 him G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Brother G0080 Saul G4549, the Lord G2962, [even] Jesus G2424, that appeared G3700 (AorPasPtc) unto thee G4671 in G1722 the way G3598 as G3739 thou camest G2064 (ImpfMidPasDepInd), hath sent G0649 (PerfActInd) me G3165, that G3704 thou mightest receive thy sight G0308 (AorActSubj), and G2532 be filled with G4130 (AorPasSubj) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
009:018 And G2532 immediately G2112 there fell G0634 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 his G0846 eyes G3788 as G5616 it had been scales G3013: and he received sight G0308 (AorActInd) forthwith G3916, and G5037 arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 was baptized G0907 (AorPasInd).
009:019 And G2532 when he had received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) meat G5160, he was strengthened G1765 (AorActInd). Then G1161 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) Saul G4569 certain G5100 days G2250 with G3326 the disciples G3101 which were at G1722 Damascus G1154.
009:020 And G2532 straightway G2112 he preached G2784 (ImpfActInd) Christ G5547 in G1722 the synagogues G4864, that G3754 he G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316.
009:021 But G1161 all G3956 that heard G0191 (PresActPtc) [him] were amazed G1839 (ImpfMidInd), and G2532 said G3004 (ImpfActInd); Is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 this G3778 he that destroyed G4199 (AorActPtc) them which G3588 called on G1941 (PresMidPtc) this G5124 name G3686 in G1722 Jerusalem G2419, and G2532 came G2064 (PlupfActInd) hither G5602 for G1519 that G5124 intent G1519, that G2443 he might bring G0071 (Aor2ActSubj) them G0846 bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) unto G1909 the chief priests G0749?
009:022 But G1161 Saul G4569 increased G1743 the more G3123 in strength G1743 (ImpfPasInd), and G2532 confounded G4797 (ImpfActInd) the Jews G2453 which G3588 dwelt G2730 (PresActPtc) at G1722 Damascus G1154, proving G4822 (PresActPtc) that G3754 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) very Christ G5547.
009:023 And G1161 after G5613 that many G2425 days G2250 were fulfilled G4137 (ImpfPasInd), the Jews G2453 took counsel G4823 (AorMidInd) to kill G0337 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846:
009:024 But G1161 their G0846 laying await G1917 was known G1097 (AorPasInd) of Saul G4569. And G5037 they watched G3906 (ImpfActInd) the gates G4439 day G2250 and G2532 night G3571 to G3704 kill G0337 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
009:025 Then G1161 the disciples G3101 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 by night G3571, and let [him] down G2524 (AorActInd) G5465 (AorActPtc) by G1223 the wall G5038 in G1722 a basket G4711.
009:026 And G1161 when Saul G4569 was come G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, he assayed G3987 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to join himself G2853 (PresPasInf) to the disciples G3101: but G2532 they were G5399 all G3956 afraid G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) of him G0846, and believed G4100 (PresActPtc) not G3361 that G3754 he was G2076 (PresInd) a disciple G3101.
009:027 But G1161 Barnabas G0921 took G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) him G0846, and brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) [him] to G4314 the apostles G0652, and G2532 declared G1334 (AorMidDepInd) unto them G0846 how G4459 he had seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the Lord G2962 in G1722 the way G3598, and G2532 that G3754 he had spoken G2980 (AorActInd) to him G0846, and G2532 how G4459 he had preached boldly G3955 (AorMidDepInd) at G1722 Damascus G1154 in G1722 the name G3686 of Jesus G2424.
009:028 And G2532 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 them G0846 coming in G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) and G2532 going out G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) at G1722 Jerusalem G2419.
009:029 And G2532 he spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) boldly G3955 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424, and G5037 G2532 disputed G4802 (ImpfActInd) against G4314 the Grecians G1675: but G1161 they went about G2021 (ImpfActInd) to slay G0337 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846.
009:030 [Which] when G1161 the brethren G0080 knew G1921 (Aor2ActPtc), they brought G2609 him G0846 down G2609 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Caesarea G2542, and G2532 sent G1821 him G0846 forth G1821 (AorActInd) to G1519 Tarsus G5019.
009:031 Then G3303 G3767 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) the churches G1577 rest G1515 throughout G2596 all G3650 Judaea G2449 and G2532 Galilee G1056 and G2532 Samaria G4540, and were edified G3618 (PresPasPtc); and G2532 walking in G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) the fear G5401 of the Lord G2962, and G2532 in the comfort G3874 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, were multiplied G4129 (ImpfPasInd).
009:032 And G1161 it came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) to pass, as G1330 Peter G4074 passed throughout G1330 (PresMidPasDepPtc) G1223 all G3956 [quarters], he came down G2718 (Aor2ActInf) also G2532 to G4314 the saints G0040 which G3588 dwelt G2730 (PresActPtc) at Lydda G3069.
009:033 And G1161 there G1563 he found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) a certain G5100 man G0444 named G3686 Aeneas G0132, which had kept G2621 (PresMidPasDepPtc) G1909 his bed G2895 G1537 eight G3638 years G2094, and G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) sick of the palsy G3886 (PerfPasPtc).
009:034 And G2532 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Aeneas G0132, Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 maketh G2390 thee G4571 whole G2390 (PresMidPasDepInd): arise G0450 (Aor2ActImpr), and G2532 make G4766 thy G4572 bed G4766 (AorActImpr). And G2532 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActInd) immediately G2112.
009:035 And G2532 all G3956 that dwelt G2730 (PresActPtc) at Lydda G3069 and G2532 Saron G4565 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, and G3748 turned G1994 (AorActInd) to G1909 the Lord G2962.
009:036 Now G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) at G1722 Joppa G2445 a certain G5100 disciple G3102 named G3686 Tabitha G5000, which G3739 by interpretation G1329 (PresPasPtc) is called G3004 (PresPasInd) Dorcas G1393: this woman G3778 G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) full G4134 of good G0018 works G2041 and G2532 almsdeeds G1654 which G3739 she did G4160 (ImpfActInd).
009:037 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 those G1565 days G2250, that she was sick G0770 (AorActPtc), and died G0599 (Aor2ActInf): whom when G1161 they G0846 had washed G3068 (AorActPtc) G0846, they laid G5087 (AorActInd) [her] in G1722 an upper chamber G5253.
009:038 And G1161 forasmuch as G5607 (PresPtc) Lydda G3069 was nigh G1451 to Joppa G2445, and the disciples G3101 had heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 Peter G4074 was G2076 (PresInd) there G1722 G0846, they sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto G4314 him G0846 two G1417 men G0435, desiring G3870 (PresActPtc) [him] that he would G3635 not G3361 delay G3635 (AorActInf) to come G1330 (Aor2ActInf) to G2193 them G0846.
009:039 Then G1161 Peter G4074 arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) and went with G4905 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846. When he G3739 was come G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc), they brought him G0321 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the upper chamber G5253: and G2532 all G3956 the widows G5503 stood by G3936 (AorActInd) him G0846 weeping G2799 (PresActPtc), and G2532 shewing G1925 (PresMidPtc) the coats G5509 and G2532 garments G2440 which G3745 Dorcas G1393 made G4160 (ImpfActInd), while she was G5607 (PresPtc) with G3326 them G0846.
009:040 But G1161 Peter G4074 put G1544 (Aor2ActPtc) them all G3956 forth G1854, and kneeled down G5087 (Aor2ActPtc) G1119, and prayed G4336 (AorMidDepInd); and G2532 turning G1994 (AorActPtc) [him] to G4314 the body G4983 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Tabitha G5000, arise G0450 (Aor2ActImpr). And G1161 she opened G0455 (AorActInd) her G0846 eyes G3788: and G2532 when she saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) Peter G4074, she sat up G0339 (AorActInd).
009:041 And G1161 he gave G1325 (Aor2ActPtc) her G0846 [his] hand G5495, and lifted G0450 her G0846 up G0450 (AorActInd), and G1161 when he had called G5455 (AorActPtc) the saints G0040 and G2532 widows G5503, presented G3936 (AorActInd) her G0846 alive G2198 (PresActPtc).
009:042 And G1161 it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) known G1110 throughout G2596 all G3650 Joppa G2445; and G2532 many G4183 believed G4100 (AorActInd) in G1909 the Lord G2962.
009:043 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that he G0846 tarried G3306 (AorActInf) many G2425 days G2250 in G1722 Joppa G2445 with G3844 one G5100 Simon G4613 a tanner G1038.
010:001 ¶  G1161 There was G2258 (ImpfInd) a certain G5100 man G0435 in G1722 Caesarea G2542 called G3686 Cornelius G2883, a centurion G1543 of G1537 the band G4686 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) the Italian G2483 [band],
010:002 [A] devout G2152 [man], and G2532 one that feared G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) God G2316 with G4862 all G3956 his G0846 house G3624, which G5037 gave G4160 (PresActPtc) much G4183 alms G1654 to the people G2992, and G2532 prayed G1189 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to God G2316 alway G1275.
010:003 He saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 a vision G3705 evidently G5320 about G5616 the ninth G1766 hour G5610 of the day G2250 an angel G0032 of God G2316 coming in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) to G4314 him G0846, and G2532 saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) unto him G0846, Cornelius G2883.
010:004 And G1161 when he looked G0816 (AorActPtc) on him G0846, he was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) afraid G1719, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 is it G2076 (PresInd), Lord G2962? And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thy G4675 prayers G4335 and G2532 thine G4675 alms G1654 are come up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) for G1519 a memorial G3422 before G1799 God G2316.
010:005 And G2532 now G3568 send G3992 (AorActImpr) men G0435 to G1519 Joppa G2445, and G2532 call for G3343 (AorMidDepImpr) [one] Simon G4613, whose G3739 surname is G1941 (PresPasInd) Peter G4074:
010:006 He G3778 lodgeth G3579 (PresPasInd) with G3844 one G5100 Simon G4613 a tanner G1038, whose G3739 house G3614 is G2076 (PresInd) by G3844 the sea side G2281: he G3778 shall tell G2980 (FutActInd) thee G4671 what G5101 thou G4571 oughtest G1163 (PresInd) to do G4160 (PresActInf).
010:007 And G1161 when G5613 the angel G0032 which G3588 spake G2980 (PresActPtc) unto Cornelius G2883 was departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd), he called G5455 (AorActPtc) two G1417 of his G0846 household servants G3610, and G2532 a devout G2152 soldier G4757 of them that waited on G4342 him G0846 continually G4342 (PresActPtc);
010:008 And G2532 when he had declared G1834 (AorMidDepPtc) all [these] things G0537 unto them G0846, he sent G0649 (AorActInd) them G0846 to G1519 Joppa G2445.
010:009 G1161 On the morrow G1887, as they G1565 went on their journey G3596 (PresActPtc), and G2532 drew nigh G1448 (PresActPtc) unto the city G4172, Peter G4074 went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 the housetop G1430 to pray G4336 (AorMidDepInf) about G4012 the sixth G1623 hour G5610:
010:010 And G1161 he became G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) very hungry G4361, and G2532 would G2309 (ImpfActInd) have eaten G1089 (AorMidDepInf): but G1161 while they G1565 made ready G3903 (PresActPtc), he G0846 fell G1968 (Aor2ActInd) into G1909 a trance G1611,
010:011 And G2532 saw G2334 (PresActInd) heaven G3772 opened G0455 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 a certain G5100 vessel G4632 descending G2597 (PresActPtc) unto G1909 him G0846, as G5613 it had been a great G3173 sheet G3607 knit G1210 (PerfPasPtc) at the four G5064 corners G0746, and G2532 let down G2524 (PresPasPtc) to G1909 the earth G1093:
010:012 Wherein G1722 G3739 were G5225 (ImpfActInd) all manner G3956 of fourfooted beasts G5074 of the earth G1093, and G2532 wild beasts G2342, and G2532 creeping things G2062, and G2532 fowls G4071 of the air G3772.
010:013 And G2532 there came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a voice G5456 to G4314 him G0846, Rise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), Peter G4074; kill G2380 (AorActImpr), and G2532 eat G5315 (Aor2ActImpr).
010:014 But G1161 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Not so G3365, Lord G2962; for G3754 I have G5315 never G3763 eaten G5315 (Aor2ActInd) any thing G3956 that is common G2839 or G2228 unclean G0169.
010:015 And G2532 the voice G5456 [spake] unto G4314 him G0846 again G3825 G1537 the second time G1208, What G3739 God G2316 hath cleansed G2511 (AorActInd), [that] call G2840 not G3361 thou G4771 common G2840 (PresActImpr).
010:016 G1161 This G5124 was done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) thrice G1909 G5151: and G2532 the vessel G4632 was received up G0353 (AorPasInd) again G3825 into G1519 heaven G3772.
010:017 Now G1161 while G5613 Peter G4074 doubted G1280 (ImpfActInd) in G1722 himself G1438 what G5101 this vision G3705 which G3739 he had seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) should mean G0302 G1498 (PresOpt), behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) G2532, the men G0435 which G3588 were sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc) from G0575 Cornelius G2883 had made enquiry G1331 (AorActPtc) for Simon’s G4613 house G3614, and stood G2186 (Aor2ActInd) before G1909 the gate G4440,
010:018 And G2532 called G5455 (AorActPtc), and asked G4441 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) whether G1487 Simon G4613, which G3588 was surnamed G1941 (PresPasPtc) Peter G4074, were lodged G3579 (PresPasInd) there G1759.
010:019 While G1161 Peter G4074 thought G1760 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G4012 the vision G3705, the Spirit G4151 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), three G5140 men G0435 seek G2212 (PresActInd) thee G4571.
010:020 Arise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) therefore G0235, and get thee down G2597 (Aor2ActImpr), and G2532 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) with G4862 them G0846, doubting G1252 (PresMidPtc) nothing G3367: for G1360 I G1473 have sent G0649 (PerfActInd) them G0846.
010:021 Then G1161 Peter G4074 went down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) to G4314 the men G0435 which G3588 were sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc) unto G4314 him G0846 from G0575 Cornelius G2883; and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) he whom G3739 ye seek G2212 (PresActInd): what G5101 [is] the cause G0156 wherefore G1223 G3739 ye are come G3918 (PresInd)?
010:022 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Cornelius G2883 the centurion G1543, a just G1342 man G0435, and G2532 one that feareth G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) God G2316, and G5037 of good report G3140 (PresPasPtc) among G5259 all G3650 the nation G1484 of the Jews G2453, was warned from God G5537 (AorPasInd) by G5259 an holy G0040 angel G0032 to send G3343 (AorMidDepInf) for thee G4571 into G1519 his G0846 house G3624, and G2532 to hear G0191 (AorActInf) words G4487 of G3844 thee G4675.
010:023 Then G3767 called he G1528 them G0846 in G1528 (AorMidDepInd), and lodged G3579 (AorActInd) [them]. And G1161 on the morrow G1887 Peter G4074 went away G1831 (Aor2ActInd) with G4862 them G0846, and G2532 certain G5100 brethren G0080 from G0575 Joppa G2445 accompanied G4905 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846.
010:024 And G2532 the morrow G1887 after they entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Caesarea G2542. And G1161 Cornelius G2883 waited for G4328 (PresActPtc) them G0846 G2258 (ImpfInd), and had called together G4779 (AorMidPtc) his G0846 kinsmen G4773 and G2532 near G0316 friends G5384.
010:025 And G1161 as G5613 Peter G4074 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) coming in G1525 (Aor2ActInf), Cornelius G2883 met G4876 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and fell down G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) at G1909 his feet G4228, and worshipped G4352 (AorActInd) [him].
010:026 But G1161 Peter G4074 took G1453 him G0846 up G1453 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Stand up G0450 (Aor2ActImpr); I G2504 myself G0846 also G2504 am G1510 (PresInd) a man G0444.
010:027 And G2532 as he talked G4926 (PresActPtc) with him G0846, he went in G1525 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 found G2147 (PresActInd) many G4183 that were come together G4905 (PerfActPtc).
010:028 And G5037 he said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Ye G5210 know G1987 (PresMidPasDepInd) how G5613 that it is G2076 (PresInd) an unlawful thing G0111 for a man G0435 that is a Jew G2453 to keep company G2853 (PresPasInf), or G2228 come unto G4334 (PresMidPasDepInf) one of another nation G0246; but G2532 God G2316 hath shewed G1166 (AorActInd) me G1698 that I should not G3367 call G3004 (PresActInf) any G3367 man G0444 common G2839 or G2228 unclean G0169.
010:029 Therefore G1352 G2532 came I G2064 (Aor2ActInd) [unto you] without gainsaying G0369, as soon as I was sent for G3343 (AorPasPtc): I ask G4441 (PresMidPasDepInd) therefore G3767 for what G5101 intent G3056 ye have sent for G3343 (AorMidDepInd) me G3165?
010:030 And G2532 Cornelius G2883 said G5346 (ImpfInd), Four G5067 days G2250 ago G0575 I was G2252 (ImpfInd) fasting G3522 (PresActPtc) until G3360 this G5026 hour G5610; and G2532 at the ninth G1766 hour G5610 I prayed G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 my G3450 house G3624, and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a man G0435 stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) before G1799 me G3450 in G1722 bright G2986 clothing G2066,
010:031 And G2532 said G5346 (PresInd), Cornelius G2883, thy G4675 prayer G4335 is heard G1522 (AorPasInd), and G2532 thine G4675 alms G1654 are had in remembrance G3415 (AorPasInd) in the sight G1799 of God G2316.
010:032 Send G3992 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767 to G1519 Joppa G2445, and G2532 call hither G3333 (AorMidImpr) Simon G4613, whose G3739 surname is G1941 (PresPasInd) Peter G4074; he G3778 is lodged G3579 (PresPasInd) in G1722 the house G3614 of [one] Simon G4613 a tanner G1038 by G3844 the sea side G2281: who G3739, when he cometh G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc), shall speak G2980 (FutActInd) unto thee G4671.
010:033 Immediately G1824 therefore G3767 I sent G3992 (AorActInd) to G4314 thee G4571; and G5037 thou G4771 hast well G2573 done G4160 (AorActInd) that thou art come G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc). Now G3568 therefore G3767 are G3918 we G2249 all G3956 here present G3918 (PresInd) before G1799 God G2316, to hear G0191 (AorActInf) all things G3956 that are commanded G4367 (PerfPasPtc) thee G4671 of G5259 God G2316.
010:034 Then G1161 Peter G4074 opened G0455 (AorActPtc) [his] mouth G4750, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Of G1909 a truth G0225 I perceive G2638 (PresMidInd) that G3754 God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) no G3756 respecter of persons G4381:
010:035 But G0235 in G1722 every G3956 nation G1484 he that feareth G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) him G0846, and G2532 worketh G2038 (PresMidPasDepPtc) righteousness G1343, is G2076 (PresInd) accepted G1184 with him G0846.
010:036 The word G3056 which G3739 [God] sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto the children G5207 of Israel G2474, preaching G2097 (PresMidPtc) peace G1515 by G1223 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547: (he G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) Lord G2962 of all G3956:)
010:037 That word G4487, [I say], ye G5210 know G1492 (PerfActInd), which was published G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) throughout G2596 all G3650 Judaea G2449, and began G0756 (AorMidPtc) from G0575 Galilee G1056, after G3326 the baptism G0908 which G3739 John G2491 preached G2784 (AorActInd);
010:038 How G5613 God G2316 anointed G5548 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 of G0575 Nazareth G3478 with the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 and G2532 with power G1411: who G0846 G3739 went about G1330 (Aor2ActInd) doing good G2109 (PresActPtc), and G2532 healing G2390 (PresMidPasDepPtc) all G3956 that were oppressed G2616 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 the devil G1228; for G3754 God G2316 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 him G0846.
010:039 And G2532 we G2249 are G2070 (PresInd) witnesses G3144 of all things G3956 which G3739 he did G4160 (AorActInd) both G5037 in G1722 the land G5561 of the Jews G2453, and G2532 in G1722 Jerusalem G2419; whom G3739 they slew G0337 (Aor2ActInd) and hanged G2910 (AorActPtc) on G1909 a tree G3586:
010:040 Him G5126 God G2316 raised up G1453 (AorActInd) the third G5154 day G2250, and G2532 shewed G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) him G0846 openly G1717 G1325 (AorActInd);
010:041 Not G3756 to all G3956 the people G2992, but G0235 unto witnesses G3144 chosen before G4401 (PerfPasPtc) of G5259 God G2316, [even] to us G2254, who G3748 did eat G4906 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 drink with G4844 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 after G3326 he G0846 rose G0450 (Aor2ActInf) from G1537 the dead G3498.
010:042 And G2532 he commanded G3853 (AorActInd) us G2254 to preach G2784 (AorActInf) unto the people G2992, and G2532 to testify G1263 (AorMidDepInf) that G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) he G0846 which G3588 was ordained G3724 (PerfPasPtc) of G5259 God G2316 [to be] the Judge G2923 of quick G2198 (PresActPtc) and G2532 dead G3498.
010:043 To him G5129 give G3140 all G3956 the prophets G4396 witness G3140 (PresActInd), that through G1223 his G0846 name G3686 whosoever G3956 believeth G4100 (PresActPtc) in G1519 him G0846 shall receive G2983 (Aor2ActInf) remission G0859 of sins G0266.
010:044 While Peter G4074 yet G2089 spake G2980 (PresActPtc) these G5023 words G4487, the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 fell G1968 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 all G3956 them which heard G0191 (PresActPtc) the word G3056.
010:045 And G2532 they of G1537 the circumcision G4061 which believed G4103 were astonished G1839 (Aor2ActInd), as many as G3745 came with G4905 (Aor2ActInd) Peter G4074, because G3754 that on G1909 the Gentiles G1484 also G2532 was poured out G1632 (PerfPasInd) the gift G1431 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
010:046 For G1063 they heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 speak with G2980 (PresActPtc) tongues G1100, and G2532 magnify G3170 (PresActPtc) God G2316. Then G5119 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) Peter G4074,
010:047 Can G3385 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) any man G5100 forbid G2967 (AorActInf) water G5204, that these G5128 should G0907 not G3361 be baptized G0907 (AorPasInf), which G3748 have received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 as G2532 well as G2531 we G2249?
010:048 And G5037 he commanded G4367 (AorActInd) them G0846 to be baptized G0907 (AorPasInf) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962. Then G5119 prayed they G2065 (AorActInd) him G0846 to tarry G1961 (AorActInf) certain G5100 days G2250.
011:001 ¶  And G1161 the apostles G0652 and G2532 brethren G0080 that were G5607 (PresPtc) in G2596 Judaea G2449 heard G0191 (AorActInd) that G3754 the Gentiles G1484 had G1209 also G2532 received G1209 (AorMidDepInd) the word G3056 of God G2316.
011:002 And G2532 when G3753 Peter G4074 was come up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414, they that were of G1537 the circumcision G4061 contended G1252 (ImpfMidInd) with G4314 him G0846,
011:003 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 Thou wentest in G1525 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 men G0435 uncircumcised G0203 G2192 (PresActPtc), and G2532 didst eat G4906 (Aor2ActInd) with them G0846.
011:004 But G1161 Peter G4074 rehearsed [the matter] from the beginning G0756 (AorMidPtc), and expounded G1620 (ImpfMidInd) [it] by order G2517 unto them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
011:005 I G1473 was G2252 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the city G4172 of Joppa G2445 praying G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc): and G2532 in G1722 a trance G1611 I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) a vision G3705, A certain G5100 vessel G4632 descend G2597 (PresActPtc), as it had been G5613 a great G3173 sheet G3607, let down G2524 (PresPasPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772 by four G5064 corners G0746; and G2532 it came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) even G0891 to me G1700:
011:006 Upon G1519 the which G3739 when I had fastened mine eyes G0816 (AorActPtc), I considered G2657 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) fourfooted beasts G5074 of the earth G1093, and G2532 wild beasts G2342, and G2532 creeping things G2062, and G2532 fowls G4071 of the air G3772.
011:007 And G1161 I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a voice G5456 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto me G3427, Arise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), Peter G4074; slay G2380 (AorActImpr) and G2532 eat G5315 (Aor2ActImpr).
011:008 But G1161 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Not so G3365, Lord G2962: for G3754 nothing G3956 common G2839 or G2228 unclean G0169 hath G1525 at any time G3763 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 my G3450 mouth G4750.
011:009 But G1161 the voice G5456 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) me G3427 again G1537 G1208 from G1537 heaven G3772, What G3739 God G2316 hath cleansed G2511 (AorActInd), [that] call G2840 not G3361 thou G4771 common G2840 (PresActImpr).
011:010 And G1161 this G5124 was done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) G1909 three times G5151: and G2532 all G0537 were drawn up G0385 (AorPasInd) again G3825 into G1519 heaven G3772.
011:011 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), immediately G1824 there were G2186 three G5140 men G0435 already G1824 come G2186 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1909 the house G3614 where G1722 G3739 G3739 I was G2252 (ImpfInd), sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc) from G0575 Caesarea G2542 unto G4314 me G3165.
011:012 And G1161 the Spirit G4151 bade G2036 (Aor2ActInd) me G3427 go with G4905 (Aor2ActInf) them G0846, nothing G3367 doubting G1252 (PresMidPtc). Moreover G1161 G2532 these G3778 six G1803 brethren G0080 accompanied G4862 G2064 (Aor2ActInd) me G1698, and G2532 we entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the man’s G0435 house G3624:
011:013 And G5037 he shewed G0518 (AorActInd) us G2254 how G4459 he had seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) an angel G0032 in G1722 his G0846 house G3624, which stood G2476 (AorPasPtc) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) unto him G0846, Send G0649 (AorActImpr) men G0435 to G1519 Joppa G2445, and G2532 call for G3343 (AorMidDepImpr) Simon G4613, whose surname is G1941 (PresPasPtc) Peter G4074;
011:014 Who G3739 shall tell G2980 (FutActInd) thee G4314 G4571 words G4487, whereby G1722 G3739 thou G4771 and G2532 all G3956 thy G4675 house G3624 shall be saved G4982 (FutPasInd).
011:015 And G1161 as G1722 I G3165 began G0756 (AorMidInf) to speak G2980 (PresActInf), the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 fell G1968 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 them G0846, as G5618 G2532 on G1909 us G2248 at G1722 the beginning G0746.
011:016 Then G1161 remembered I G3415 (AorPasInd) the word G4487 of the Lord G2962, how G5613 that he said G3004 (ImpfActInd), John G2491 indeed G3303 baptized G0907 (AorActInd) with water G5204; but G1161 ye G5210 shall be baptized G0907 (FutPasInd) with G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
011:017 Forasmuch G1487 then G3767 as G5613 God G2316 gave G1325 (AorActInd) them G0846 the like G2470 gift G1431 as G2532 [he did] unto us G2254, who believed G4100 (AorActPtc) on G1909 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547; G1161 what G5101 was G2252 (ImpfInd) I G1473, that I could G1415 withstand G2967 (AorActInf) God G2316?
011:018 When G1161 they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) these things G5023, they held their peace G2270 (AorActInd), and G2532 glorified G1392 (ImpfActInd) God G2316, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Then G0686 hath G1325 God G2316 also G2534 to the Gentiles G1484 granted G1325 (AorActInd) repentance G3341 unto G1519 life G2222.
011:019 Now G3767 G3303 they which were scattered abroad G1289 (Aor2PasPtc) upon G0575 the persecution G2347 that arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) about G1909 Stephen G4736 travelled G1330 (Aor2ActInd) as far as G2193 Phenice G5403, and G2532 Cyprus G2954, and G2532 Antioch G0490, preaching G2980 (PresActPtc) the word G3056 to none G3367 but G1508 unto the Jews G2453 only G3440.
011:020 And G1161 some G5100 of G1537 them G0846 were G2258 (ImpfInd) men G0435 of Cyprus G2953 and G2532 Cyrene G2956, which G3748, when they were come G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 Antioch G0490, spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) unto G4314 the Grecians G1675, preaching G2097 (PresMidPtc) the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424.
011:021 And G2532 the hand G5495 of the Lord G2962 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 them G0846: and G5037 a great G4183 number G0706 believed G4100 (AorActPtc), and turned G1994 (AorActInd) unto G1909 the Lord G2962.
011:022 Then G1161 tidings G3056 of G4012 these things G0846 came G0191 (AorPasInd) unto G1519 the ears G3775 of the church G1577 which G3588 was in G1722 Jerusalem G2414: and G2532 they sent forth G1821 (AorActInd) Barnabas G0921, that he should go G1330 (Aor2ActInf) as far as G2193 Antioch G0490.
011:023 Who G3739, when he came G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc), and G2532 had seen G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the grace G5485 of God G2316, was glad G5463 (Aor2PasDepInd), and G2532 exhorted G3870 (ImpfActInd) them all G3956, that with purpose G4286 of heart G2588 they would cleave unto G4357 (PresActInf) the Lord G2962.
011:024 For G3754 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) a good G0018 man G0435, and G2532 full G4134 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 and G2532 of faith G4102: and G2532 much G2425 people G3793 was added G4369 (AorPasInd) unto the Lord G2962.
011:025 Then G1161 departed G1831 (Aor2ActInd) Barnabas G0921 to G1519 Tarsus G5019, for to seek G0327 (AorActInf) Saul G4569:
011:026 And G2532 when he had found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, he brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 unto G1519 Antioch G0490. And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that a whole G3650 year G1763 they G0846 assembled themselves G4863 (AorPasInf) with G1722 the church G1577, and G2532 taught G1321 (AorActInf) much G2425 people G3793. And G5037 the disciples G3101 were called G5537 (AorActInf) Christians G5546 first G4412 in G1722 Antioch G0490.
011:027 And G1161 in G1722 these G5025 days G2250 came G2718 (Aor2ActInd) prophets G4396 from G0575 Jerusalem G2414 unto G1519 Antioch G0490.
011:028 And G1161 there stood up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) one G1520 of G1537 them G0846 named G3686 Agabus G0013, and signified G4591 (AorActInd) by G1223 the Spirit G4151 that there should be G3195 (PresActInf) G1510 (FutInf) great G3173 dearth G3042 throughout G1909 all G3650 the world G3625: which G3748 G2532 came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in the days of G1909 Claudius G2804 Caesar G2541.
011:029 Then G1161 the disciples G3101, every G1538 man G0846 according to G2531 his ability G2141 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) G5100, determined G3724 (AorActInd) to send G3992 (AorActInf) relief G1248 unto G1519 the brethren G0080 which dwelt G2730 (PresActPtc) in G1722 Judaea G2449:
011:030 Which G3739 also G2532 they did G4160 (AorActInd), and sent it G0649 (AorActPtc) to G4314 the elders G4245 by G1223 the hands G5495 of Barnabas G0921 and G2532 Saul G4569.
012:001 ¶  Now G1161 about G2596 that G1565 time G2540 Herod G2264 the king G0935 stretched forth G1911 (Aor2ActInd) [his] hands G5495 to vex G2559 (AorActInf) certain G5100 of G0575 the church G1577.
012:002 And G1161 he killed G0337 (Aor2ActInd) James G2385 the brother G0080 of John G2491 with the sword G3162.
012:003 And G2532 because he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) it G3754 pleased G2076 (PresInd) G0701 the Jews G2453, he proceeded further G4369 (Aor2MidInd) to take G4815 (Aor2ActInf) Peter G4074 also G2532. (Then G1161 were G2258 (ImpfInd) the days G2250 of unleavened bread G0106.)
012:004 And G3739 G2532 when he had apprehended G4084 (AorActPtc) him, he put G5087 (Aor2MidInd) [him] in G1519 prison G5438, and delivered G3860 (Aor2ActPtc) [him] to four G5064 quaternions G5069 of soldiers G4757 to keep G5442 (PresActInf) him G0846; intending G1014 (PresMidPasDepPtc) after G3326 Easter G3957 to bring G0321 him G0846 forth G0321 (Aor2ActInf) to the people G2992.
012:005 Peter G4074 G3303 therefore G3767 was kept G5083 (ImpfPasInd) in G1722 prison G5438: but G1161 prayer G4335 was G2258 (ImpfInd) made G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) without ceasing G1618 of G5259 the church G1577 unto G4314 God G2316 for G5228 him G0846.
012:006 And G1161 when G3753 Herod G2264 would G3195 (ImpfActInd) have brought G4254 him G0846 forth G4254 (PresActInf), the same G1565 night G3571 Peter G4074 was G2258 (ImpfInd) sleeping G2837 (PresPasPtc) between G3342 two G1417 soldiers G4757, bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) with two G1417 chains G0254: and G5037 the keepers G5441 before G4253 the door G2374 kept G5083 (ImpfActInd) the prison G5438.
012:007 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 came upon G2186 (Aor2ActInd) [him], and G2532 a light G5457 shined G2989 (AorActInd) in G1722 the prison G3612: and G1161 he smote G3960 (AorActPtc) Peter G4074 on the side G4125, and raised G1453 him G0846 up G1453 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Arise up G0450 (Aor2ActImpr) quickly G1722 G5034. And G2532 his G0846 chains G0254 fell off G1601 (Aor2ActInd) from G1537 [his] hands G5495.
012:008 And G5037 the angel G0032 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Gird thyself G4024 (AorMidImpr), and G2532 bind on G5265 (AorMidImpr) thy G4675 sandals G4547. And G1161 so G3779 he did G4160 (AorActInd). And G2532 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Cast G4016 thy garment G2440 about G4016 (Aor2MidImpr) thee G4675, and G2532 follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
012:009 And G2532 he went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) him G0846; and G2532 wist G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 it was G2076 (PresInd) true G0227 which G3588 was done G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) by G1223 the angel G0032; but G1161 thought G1380 (ImpfActInd) he saw G0991 (PresActInf) a vision G3705.
012:010 When G1161 they were past G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) the first G4413 and G2532 the second G1208 ward G5438, they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1909 the iron G4603 gate G4439 that leadeth G5342 (PresActPtc) unto G1519 the city G4172; which G3748 opened G0455 (AorPasInd) to them G0846 of his own accord G0844: and G2532 they went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and passed on through G4281 (Aor2ActInd) one G3391 street G4505; and G2532 forthwith G2112 the angel G0032 departed G0868 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 him G0846.
012:011 And G2532 when Peter G4074 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) to G1722 himself G1438, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Now G3568 I know G1492 (PerfActInd) of a surety G0230, that G3754 the Lord G2962 hath sent G1821 (AorActInd) his G0846 angel G0032, and G2532 hath delivered G1807 (Aor2MidInd) me G3165 out of G1537 the hand G5495 of Herod G2264, and G2532 [from] all G3956 the expectation G4329 of the people G2992 of the Jews G2453.
012:012 And G5037 when he had considered G4894 (Aor2ActPtc) [the thing], he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1909 the house G3614 of Mary G3137 the mother G3384 of John G2491, whose surname was G1941 (PresPasPtc) Mark G3138; where G3757 many G2425 were G2258 (ImpfInd) gathered together G4867 (PerfPasPtc) praying G2532 G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
012:013 And G1161 as Peter G4074 knocked at G2925 (AorActPtc) the door G2374 of the gate G4440, a damsel G3814 came G4334 (Aor2ActInd) to hearken G5219 (AorActInf), named G3686 Rhoda G4498.
012:014 And G2532 when she knew G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) Peter’s G4074 voice G5456, she opened G0455 (AorActInd) not G3756 the gate G4440 for G0575 gladness G5479, but G1161 ran in G1532 (Aor2ActPtc), and told how G0518 (AorActInd) Peter G4074 stood G2476 (PerfActInf) before G4253 the gate G4440.
012:015 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 her G0846, Thou art mad G3105 (PresMidPasDepInd). But G1161 she constantly affirmed G1340 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) that it was G2192 (PresActInf) even so G3779. Then G1161 said they G3004 (ImpfActInd), It is G2076 (PresInd) his G0846 angel G0032.
012:016 But G1161 Peter G4074 continued G1961 (ImpfActInd) knocking G2925 (PresActPtc): and G1161 when they had opened G0455 (AorActPtc) [the door], and saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, G2532 they were astonished G1839 (Aor2ActInd).
012:017 But G1161 he, beckoning G2678 (AorActPtc) unto them G0846 with the hand G5495 to hold their peace G4601 (PresActInf), declared G1334 (AorMidDepInd) unto them G0846 how G4459 the Lord G2962 had brought G1806 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 out of G1537 the prison G5438. And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Go shew G0518 (AorActImpr) these things G5023 unto James G2385, and G2532 to the brethren G0080. And G2532 he departed G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and went G4198 (AorPasDepInd) into G1519 another G2087 place G5117.
012:018 Now G1161 as soon as it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) day G2250, there was G2258 (ImpfInd) no G3756 small G3641 stir G5017 among G1722 the soldiers G4757, what G5101 G0686 was become G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) of Peter G4074.
012:019 And G1161 when G1934 Herod G2264 had sought for G1934 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and G2532 found him G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) not G3361, he examined G0350 (AorActPtc) the keepers G5441, and commanded G2753 (AorActInd) that [they] should be put to death G0520 (AorPasInf). And G2532 he went down G2718 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 Judaea G2449 to G1519 Caesarea G2542, and [there] abode G1304 (ImpfActInd).
012:020 And G1161 Herod G2264 was G2258 (ImpfInd) highly displeased G2371 (PresActPtc) with them of Tyre G5183 and G2532 Sidon G4606: but G1161 they came G3918 (ImpfInd) with one accord G3661 to G4314 him G0846, and G2532, having made G3982 Blastus G0986 the king’s G0935 chamberlain G1909 G2846 their friend G3982 (AorActPtc), desired G0154 (ImpfMidInd) peace G1515; because G1223 their G0846 country G5561 was nourished G5142 (PresPasInf) by G0575 the king’s G0937 [country].
012:021 And G1161 upon a set G5002 day G2250 Herod G2264, arrayed G1746 (AorMidPtc) in royal G0937 apparel G2066, sat G2523 (AorActPtc) upon G1909 his throne G0968, and G2532 made an oration G1215 (ImpfActInd) unto G4314 them G0846.
012:022 And G1161 the people G1218 gave a shout G2019 (ImpfActInd), [saying, It is] the voice G5456 of a god G2316, and G2532 not G3756 of a man G0444.
012:023 And G1161 immediately G3916 the angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 smote G3960 (AorActInd) him G0846, because G0473 G3739 he gave G1325 (AorActInd) not G3756 God G2316 the glory G1391: and G2532 he was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) eaten of worms G4662, and gave up the ghost G1634 (AorActInd).
012:024 But G1161 the word G3056 of God G2316 grew G0837 (ImpfActInd) and G2532 multiplied G4129 (ImpfPasInd).
012:025 And G1161 Barnabas G0921 and G2532 Saul G4569 returned G5290 (AorActInd) from G1537 Jerusalem G2419, when they had fulfilled G4137 (AorActPtc) [their] ministry G1248, and G2532 took with them G4838 (Aor2ActPtc) John G2491, whose surname was G1941 (AorPasPtc) Mark G3138.
013:001 ¶  Now G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) in G2596 the church G1577 that was G5607 (PresPtc) at G1722 Antioch G0490 certain G5100 prophets G4396 and G2532 teachers G1320; as G5037 Barnabas G0921, and G2532 Simeon G4826 that was called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Niger G3526, and G2532 Lucius G3066 of Cyrene G2956, and G5037 Manaen G3127, which had been brought up G4939 with Herod G2264 the tetrarch G5076, and G2532 Saul G4569.
013:002 As G1161 they G0846 ministered G3008 (PresActPtc) to the Lord G2962, and G2532 fasted G3522 (PresActPtc), the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), G1211 Separate G0873 (AorActImpr) me G3427 G5037 Barnabas G0921 and G2532 Saul G4569 for G1519 the work G2041 whereunto G3739 I have called G4341 (PerfMidPasDepInd) them G0846.
013:003 And G5119 when they had fasted G3522 (AorActPtc) and G2532 prayed G4336 (AorMidDepPtc), and G2532 laid G2007 [their] hands G5495 on G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846, they sent [them] away G0630 (AorActInd).
013:004 So G3303 G3767 they G3778, being sent forth G1599 (AorPasPtc) by G5259 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, departed G2718 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 Seleucia G4581; and from G1564 thence G5037 they sailed G0636 (AorActInd) to G1519 Cyprus G2954.
013:005 And G2532 when they were G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) at G1722 Salamis G4529, they preached G2605 (ImpfActInd) the word G3056 of God G2316 in G1722 the synagogues G4864 of the Jews G2453: and G1161 they had G2192 (ImpfActInd) also G2532 John G2491 to [their] minister G5257.
013:006 And G1161 when they had gone through G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) the isle G3520 unto G0891 Paphos G3974, they found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) a certain G5100 sorcerer G3097, a false prophet G5578, a Jew G2453, whose G3739 name G3686 [was] Barjesus G0919:
013:007 Which G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G4862 the deputy of the country G0446, Sergius G4588 Paulus G3972, a prudent G4908 man G0435; who G3778 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) for Barnabas G0921 and G2532 Saul G4569, and desired G1934 (AorActInd) to hear G0191 (AorActInf) the word G3056 of God G2316.
013:008 But G1161 Elymas G1681 the sorcerer G3097 (for G1063 so G3779 is his G0846 name G3686 by interpretation G3177 (PresPasInd) ) withstood G0436 (ImpfMidInd) them G0846, seeking G2212 (PresActPtc) to turn away G1294 (AorActInf) the deputy G0446 from G0575 the faith G4102.
013:009 Then G1161 Saul G4569, (who G3588 also G2532 [is called] Paul G3972,) filled with G4130 (AorPasPtc) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, G2532 set his eyes G0816 (AorActPtc) on G1519 him G0846,
013:010 And said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), O G5599 full G4134 of all G3956 subtilty G1388 and G2532 all G3956 mischief G4468, [thou] child G5207 of the devil G1228, [thou] enemy G2190 of all G3956 righteousness G1343, wilt thou G3973 not G3756 cease G3973 (FutMidDepInd) to pervert G1294 (PresActPtc) the right G2117 ways G3598 of the Lord G2962?
013:011 And G2532 now G3568, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the hand G5495 of the Lord G2962 [is] upon G1909 thee G4571, and G2532 thou shalt be G2071 (FutInd) blind G5185, not G3361 seeing G0991 (PresActPtc) the sun G2246 for G0891 a season G2540. And G1161 immediately G3916 there fell G1968 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 him G0846 a mist G0887 and G2532 a darkness G4655; and G2532 he went about G4013 (PresActPtc) seeking G2212 (ImpfActInd) some to lead him by the hand G5497.
013:012 Then G5119 the deputy G0446, when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) what was done G1096 (Perf2ActPtc), believed G4100 (AorActInd), being astonished G1605 (PresPasPtc) at G1909 the doctrine G1322 of the Lord G2962.
013:013 Now G1161 when Paul G3972 and his company G4012 loosed G0321 (AorPasPtc) from G0575 Paphos G3974, they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Perga G4011 in Pamphylia G3828: and G1161 John G2491 departing G0672 (AorActPtc) from G0575 them G0846 returned G5290 (AorActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414.
013:014 But G1161 when they G0846 departed G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 Perga G4011, they came G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd) to G1519 Antioch G0490 in Pisidia G4099, and G2532 went G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the synagogue G4864 on the sabbath G4521 day G2250, and sat down G2523 (AorActInd).
013:015 And G1161 after G3326 the reading G0320 of the law G3551 and G2532 the prophets G4396 the rulers of the synagogue G0752 sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), [Ye] men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, if G1487 ye have G2076 (PresInd) G1722 G5213 any word G3056 of exhortation G3874 for G4314 the people G2992, say on G3004 (PresActImpr).
013:016 Then G1161 Paul G3972 stood up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 beckoning G2678 (AorActPtc) with [his] hand G5495 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Men G0435 of Israel G2475, and G2532 ye that fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) God G2316, give audience G0191 (AorActImpr).
013:017 The God G2316 of this G5127 people G2992 of Israel G2474 chose G1586 (AorMidInd) our G2257 fathers G3962, and G2532 exalted G5312 (AorActInd) the people G2992 when G1722 they dwelt as strangers G3940 in G1722 the land G1093 of Egypt G0125, and G2532 with G3326 an high G5308 arm G1023 brought he G1806 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 out of G1537 it G0846.
013:018 And G2532 about G5613 the time G5550 of forty years G5063 suffered he G5159 their G0846 manners G5159 (AorActInd) in G1722 the wilderness G2048.
013:019 And G2532 when he had destroyed G2507 (Aor2ActPtc) seven G2033 nations G1484 in G1722 the land G1093 of Chanaan G5477, he divided G2624 their G0846 land G1093 to them G0846 by lot G2624 (AorActInd).
013:020 And G2532 after G3326 that G5023 he gave G1325 (AorActInd) [unto them] judges G2923 about G5613 the space of four hundred G5071 and G2532 fifty G4004 years G2094, until G2193 Samuel G4545 the prophet G4396.
013:021 And afterward G2547 they desired G0154 (AorMidInd) a king G0935: and G2532 God G2316 gave G1325 (AorActInd) unto them G0846 Saul G4549 the son G5207 of Cis G2797, a man G0435 of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Benjamin G0958, by the space of forty G5062 years G2094.
013:022 And G2532 when he had removed G3179 (AorActPtc) him G0846, he raised up G1453 (AorActInd) unto them G0846 David G1138 to be G1519 their king G0935; to whom G3739 also G2532 he gave testimony G3140 (AorActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I have found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) David G1138 the [son] of Jesse G2421, a man G0435 after G2596 mine own G3450 heart G2588, which G3739 shall fulfil G4160 (FutActInd) all G3956 my G3450 will G2307.
013:023 Of G0575 this man’s G5127 seed G4690 hath G1453 God G2316 according G2596 to [his] promise G1860 raised G1453 (AorActInd) unto Israel G2474 a Saviour G4990, Jesus G2424:
013:024 When John G2491 had first preached G4296 (AorActPtc) before G4253 his G0846 coming G4383 G1529 the baptism G0908 of repentance G3341 to all G3956 the people G2992 of Israel G2474.
013:025 And G1161 as G5613 John G2491 fulfilled G4137 (ImpfActInd) his course G1408, he said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Whom G5101 think ye G5282 (PresActInd) that I G3165 am G1511 (PresInf)? I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 [he]. But G0235, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there cometh one G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) after G3326 me G1691, whose G3739 shoes G5266 of [his] feet G4228 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G0514 to loose G3089 (AorActInf).
013:026 Men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, children G5207 of the stock G1085 of Abraham G0011, and G2532 whosoever among G1722 you G5213 feareth G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) God G2316, to you G5213 is G0649 the word G3056 of this G5026 salvation G4991 sent G0649 (Aor2PasDepSubj).
013:027 For G1063 they that dwell G2730 (PresActPtc) at G1722 Jerusalem G2419, and G2532 their G0846 rulers G0758, because they knew G0050 him G5126 not G0050 (AorActPtc), nor yet G2532 the voices G5456 of the prophets G4396 which G3588 are read G0314 (PresPasPtc) G2596 every G3956 sabbath day G4521, they have fulfilled G4137 (AorActInd) [them] in condemning G2919 (AorActPtc) [him].
013:028 And G2532 though they found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) no G3367 cause G0156 of death G2288 [in him], yet desired they G0154 (AorMidInd) Pilate G4091 that he G0846 should be slain G0337 (AorPasInf).
013:029 And G1161 when G5613 they had fulfilled G5055 (AorActInd) all G0537 that was written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) of G4012 him G0846, they took [him] down G2507 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 the tree G3586, and laid G5087 (AorActInd) [him] in G1519 a sepulchre G3419.
013:030 But G1161 God G2316 raised G1453 (AorActInd) him G0846 from G1537 the dead G3498:
013:031 And he G3739 was seen G3700 (AorPasInd) many G1909 G4119 days G2250 of them which came up with G4872 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 from G0575 Galilee G1056 to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, who G3748 are G1526 (PresInd) his G0846 witnesses G3144 unto G4314 the people G2992.
013:032 And G2532 we G2249 declare G2097 unto you G5209 glad tidings G2097 (PresMidInd), how that G3754 the promise G1860 which was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) unto G4314 the fathers G3962,
013:033 God G2316 hath fulfilled G1603 (PerfActInd) the same G5026 unto us G2254 their G0846 children G5043, in that he hath raised up G0450 Jesus G2424 again G0450 (AorActPtc); as G5613 it is G1125 also G2532 written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 the second G1208 psalm G5568, Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) my G3450 Son G5207, this day G4594 have I G1473 begotten G1080 (PerfActInd) thee G4571.
013:034 And G1161 as concerning that G3754 he raised G0450 him G0846 up G0450 (AorActInd) from G1537 the dead G3498, [now] no more G3371 to G3195 (PresActPtc) return G5290 (PresActInf) to G1519 corruption G1312, he said G2046 (PerfActInd) on this wise G3779, G3754 I will give G1325 (FutActInd) you G5213 the sure G4103 mercies G3741 of David G1138.
013:035 Wherefore G1352 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) also G2532 in G1722 another G2087 [psalm], Thou shalt G1325 not G3756 suffer G1325 (FutActInd) thine G4675 Holy One G3741 to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) corruption G1312.
013:036 For G1063 G3303 David G1138, after he had served G5256 (AorActPtc) his own G2398 generation G1074 by the will G1012 of God G2316, fell on sleep G2837 (AorPasInd), and G2532 was laid G4369 (AorPasInd) unto G4314 his G0846 fathers G3962, and G2532 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) corruption G1312:
013:037 But G1161 he, whom G3739 God G2316 raised again G1453 (AorActInd), saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) no G3756 corruption G1312.
013:038 Be it G2077 (PresImpr) known G1110 unto you G5213 therefore G3767, men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, that G3754 through G1223 this man G5127 is preached G2605 (PresPasInd) unto you G5213 the forgiveness G0859 of sins G0266:
013:039 And G2532 by G1722 him G5129 all G3956 that believe G4100 (PresActPtc) are justified G1344 (PresPasInd) from G0575 all things G3956, from which G3739 ye could G1410 (AorPasDepInd) not G3756 be justified G1344 (AorPasInf) by G1722 the law G3551 of Moses G3475.
013:040 Beware G0991 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767, lest that G3361 come G1904 (Aor2ActSubj) upon G1909 you G5209, which is spoken of G2046 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the prophets G4396;
013:041 Behold G1492 (Aor2ActImpr), ye despisers G2707, and G2532 wonder G2296 (AorActImpr), and G2532 perish G0853 (AorPasImpr): for G3754 I G1473 work G2038 (PresMidPasDepInd) a work G2041 in G1722 your G5216 days G2250, a work G2041 which G3739 ye shall G4100 in no wise G3364 believe G4100 (AorActSubj), though G1437 a man G5100 declare it G1555 (PresMidPasDepSubj) unto you G5213.
013:042 And G1161 when the Jews G2453 were gone G1826 (Aor2Ptc) out of G1537 the synagogue G4864, the Gentiles G1484 besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) that these G5023 words G4487 might be preached G2980 (AorPasInf) to them G0846 G1519 the next G3342 sabbath G4521.
013:043 Now G1161 when the congregation G4864 was broken up G3089 (AorPasPtc), many G4183 of the Jews G2453 and G2532 religious G4576 (PresMidPasDepPtc) proselytes G4339 followed G0190 (AorActInd) Paul G3972 and G2532 Barnabas G0921: who G3748, speaking G4354 (PresActPtc) to them G0846, persuaded G3982 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 to continue G1961 (PresActInf) in the grace G5485 of God G2316.
013:044 And G1161 the next G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) sabbath day G4521 came G4863 almost G4975 the whole G3956 city G4172 together G4863 (AorPasInd) to hear G0191 (AorActInf) the word G3056 of God G2316.
013:045 But G1161 when the Jews G2453 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the multitudes G3793, they were filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with envy G2205, and G2532 spake against G0483 (ImpfActInd) those things which were spoken G3004 (PresPasPtc) by G5259 Paul G3972, contradicting G0483 (PresActPtc) and G2532 blaspheming G0987 (PresActPtc).
013:046 Then G1161 Paul G3972 and G2532 Barnabas G0921 waxed bold G3955 (AorMidDepPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), It was G2258 (ImpfInd) necessary G0316 that the word G3056 of God G2316 should G2980 first G4412 have been spoken G2980 (AorPasInf) to you G5213: but G1161 seeing G1894 ye put G0683 it G0846 from you G0683 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 judge G2919 (PresActInd) yourselves G1438 unworthy G3756 G0514 of everlasting G0166 life G2222, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), we turn G4762 (PresPasInd) to G1519 the Gentiles G1484.
013:047 For G1063 so G3779 hath G1781 the Lord G2962 commanded G1781 (PerfPasInd) us G2254, [saying], I have set G5087 (PerfActInd) thee G4571 to be G1519 a light G5457 of the Gentiles G1484, that thou G4571 shouldest be G1511 (PresInf) for G1519 salvation G4991 unto G2193 the ends G2078 of the earth G1093.
013:048 And G1161 when the Gentiles G1484 heard this G0191 (PresActPtc), they were glad G5463 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 glorified G1392 (ImpfActInd) the word G3056 of the Lord G2962: and G2532 as many as G3745 were G2258 (ImpfInd) ordained G5021 (PerfPasPtc) to G1519 eternal G0166 life G2222 believed G4100 (AorActInd).
013:049 And G1161 the word G3056 of the Lord G2962 was published G1308 (ImpfPasInd) throughout G1223 all G3650 the region G5561.
013:050 But G1161 the Jews G2453 stirred up G3951 (AorActInd) the devout G4576 (PresMidPasDepPtc) and G2532 honourable G2158 women G1135, and G2532 the chief men G4413 of the city G4172, and G2532 raised G1892 (AorActInd) persecution G1375 against G1909 Paul G3972 and G2532 Barnabas G0921, and G2532 expelled G1544 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 out of G0575 their G0846 coasts G3725.
013:051 But G1161 they shook off G1621 (AorMidPtc) the dust G2868 of their G0846 feet G4228 against G1909 them G0846, and came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 Iconium G2430.
013:052 And G1161 the disciples G3101 were filled with G4137 (ImpfPasInd) joy G5479, and G2532 with the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
014:001 ¶  And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 Iconium G2430, that they G0846 went G1525 (Aor2ActInf) both G2596 together G0846 into G1519 the synagogue G4864 of the Jews G2453, and G2532 so G3779 spake G2980 (AorActInf), that G5620 a great G4183 multitude G4128 both G5037 of the Jews G2453 and also G2532 of the Greeks G1672 believed G4100 (AorActInf).
014:002 But G1161 the unbelieving G0544 (PresActPtc) Jews G2453 stirred up G1892 (AorActInd) the Gentiles G1484, and G2532 made G2559 their minds G5590 evil affected G2559 (AorActInd) against G2596 the brethren G0080.
014:003 Long G2425 time G5550 therefore G3303 G3767 abode they G1304 (AorActInd) speaking boldly G3955 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1909 the Lord G2962, which G3588 gave testimony G3140 (PresActPtc) unto the word G3056 of his G0846 grace G5485, and G2532 granted G1325 (PresActPtc) signs G4592 and G2532 wonders G5059 to be done G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf) by G1223 their G0846 hands G5495.
014:004 But G1161 the multitude G4128 of the city G4172 was divided G4977 (AorPasInd): and G2532 part G3303 held G2258 (ImpfInd) with G4862 the Jews G2453, and G1161 part with G4862 the apostles G0652.
014:005 And G1161 when G5613 there was G1096 an assault G3730 made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) both G5037 of the Gentiles G1484, and also G2532 of the Jews G2453 with G4862 their G0846 rulers G0758, to use [them] despitefully G5195 (AorActInf), and G2532 to stone G3036 (AorActInf) them G0846,
014:006 They were ware G4894 (Aor2ActPtc) of [it], and fled G2703 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 Lystra G3082 and G2532 Derbe G1191, cities G4172 of Lycaonia G3071, and G2532 unto the region that lieth round about G4066:
014:007 And there G2546 they preached the gospel G2258 (ImpfInd) G2097 (PresMidPtc).
014:008 And G2532 there sat G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) a certain G5100 man G0435 at G1722 Lystra G3082, impotent G0102 in his feet G4228, being G5225 (PresActPtc) a cripple G5560 from G1537 his G0846 mother’s G3384 womb G2836, who G3739 never G3763 had walked G4043 (PlupfActInd):
014:009 The same G3778 heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) Paul G3972 speak G2980 (PresActPtc): who G3739 stedfastly beholding G0816 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and G2532 perceiving G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he had G2192 (PresActInd) faith G4102 to be healed G4982 (AorPasInf),
014:010 Said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, Stand G0450 (Aor2ActImpr) upright G3717 on G1909 thy G4675 feet G4228. And G2532 he leaped G0242 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) and G2532 walked G4043 (ImpfActInd).
014:011 And G1161 when the people G3793 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) what G3739 Paul G3972 had done G4160 (AorActInd), they lifted up G1869 (AorActInd) their G0846 voices G5456, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) in the speech of Lycaonia G3072, The gods G2316 are come down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 us G2248 in the likeness G3666 (AorPasPtc) of men G0444.
014:012 And G5037 they called G2564 (ImpfActInd) Barnabas G0921, G3303 Jupiter G2203; and G1161 Paul G3972, Mercurius G2060, because G1894 he G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the chief G2233 (PresMidPasDepPtc) speaker G3056.
014:013 Then G1161 the priest G2409 of Jupiter G2203, which G3588 was G5607 (PresPtc) before G4253 their G0846 city G4172, brought G5342 (AorActPtc) oxen G5022 and G2532 garlands G4725 unto G1909 the gates G4440, and would G2309 (ImpfActInd) have done sacrifice G2380 (PresActInf) with G4862 the people G3793.
014:014 [Which] when G1161 the apostles G0652, Barnabas G0921 and G2532 Paul G3972, heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [of], they rent G1284 (AorActPtc) their G0846 clothes G2440, and ran G1530 (AorActInd) in among G1519 the people G3793, crying out G2896 (PresActPtc),
014:015 And G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Sirs G0435, why G5101 do ye G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5130? We G2249 also G2532 are G2070 (PresInd) men G0444 of like passions G3663 with you G5213, and preach G2097 (PresMidPtc) unto you G5209 that ye should turn G1994 (PresActInf) from G0575 these G5023 vanities G3152 unto G1909 the living G2198 (PresActPtc) God G2316, which G3739 made G4160 (AorActInd) heaven G3772, and G2532 earth G1093, and G2532 the sea G2281, and G2532 all things G3956 that are therein G1722 G0846:
014:016 Who G3739 in G1722 times G1074 past G3944 (PerfMidPasDepPtc) suffered G1439 (AorActInd) all G3956 nations G1484 to walk G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) in their own G0846 ways G3598.
014:017 Nevertheless G2544 G2532 he left G0863 (AorActInd) not G3756 himself G1438 without witness G0267, in that he did good G0015 (PresActPtc), and gave G1325 (PresActPtc) us G2254 rain G5205 from heaven G3771, and G2532 fruitful G2593 seasons G2540, filling G1705 (PresActPtc) our G2257 hearts G2588 with food G5160 and G2532 gladness G2167.
014:018 And G2532 with these G5023 sayings G3004 (PresActPtc) scarce G3433 restrained they G2664 (AorActInd) the people G3793, that they had G2380 not G3361 done sacrifice G2380 (PresActInf) unto them G0846.
014:019 And G1161 there came thither G1904 (Aor2ActInd) [certain] Jews G2453 from G0575 Antioch G0490 and G2532 Iconium G2430, who G2532 persuaded G3982 (AorActPtc) the people G3793, and G2532, having stoned G3034 (AorActPtc) Paul G3972, drew G4951 (ImpfActInd) [him] out of G1854 the city G4172, supposing G3543 (AorActPtc) he G0846 had been dead G2348 (Perf2ActInf).
014:020 Howbeit G1161, as the disciples G3101 stood round about G2944 (AorActPtc) him G0846, he rose up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and came G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the city G4172: and G2532 the next day G1887 he departed G1831 (Aor2ActInd) with G4862 Barnabas G0921 to G1519 Derbe G1191.
014:021 And G5037 when they had preached the gospel G2097 (AorMidPtc) to that G1565 city G4172, and G2532 had taught G3100 (AorActPtc) many G2425, they returned again G5290 (AorActInd) to G1519 Lystra G3082, and G2532 [to] Iconium G2430, and G2532 Antioch G0490,
014:022 Confirming G1991 (PresActPtc) the souls G5590 of the disciples G3101, [and] exhorting them G3870 (PresActPtc) to continue G1696 (PresActInf) in the faith G4102, and G2532 that G3754 we G2248 must G1163 (PresInd) through G1223 much G4183 tribulation G2347 enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
014:023 And G1161 when they had ordained G5500 (AorActPtc) them G0846 elders G4245 in every G2596 church G1577, and had prayed G4336 (AorMidDepPtc) with G3326 fasting G3521, they commended G3908 (Aor2MidInd) them G0846 to the Lord G2962, on G1519 whom G3739 they believed G4100 (PlupfActInd).
014:024 And G2532 after they had passed throughout G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) Pisidia G4099, they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Pamphylia G3828.
014:025 And G2532 when they had preached G2980 (AorActPtc) the word G3056 in G1722 Perga G4011, they went down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Attalia G0825:
014:026 And thence G2547 sailed G0636 (AorActInd) to G1519 Antioch G0490, from whence G3606 they had been G2258 (ImpfInd) recommended G3860 (PerfPasPtc) to the grace G5485 of God G2316 for G1519 the work G2041 which G3739 they fulfilled G4137 (AorActInd).
014:027 And G1161 when they were come G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc), and G2532 had gathered G4863 the church G1577 together G4863 (Aor2ActPtc), they rehearsed G0312 (AorActInd) all G3745 that God G2316 had done G4160 (AorActInd) with G3326 them G0846, and G2532 how G3754 he had opened G0455 (AorActInd) the door G2374 of faith G4102 unto the Gentiles G1484.
014:028 And G1161 there G1563 they abode G1304 (ImpfActInd) long G3756 G3641 time G5550 with G4862 the disciples G3101.
015:001 ¶  And G2532 certain men G5100 which came down G2718 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 Judaea G2449 taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) the brethren G0080, [and said], G3754 Except G3362 ye be circumcised G4059 (PresPasSubj) after the manner G1485 of Moses G3475, ye cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be saved G4982 (AorPasInf).
015:002 When therefore G3767 Paul G3972 and G2532 Barnabas G0921 had G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) no G3756 small G3641 dissension G4714 and G2532 disputation G4803 with G4314 them G0846, they determined G5021 (AorActInd) that Paul G3972 and G2532 Barnabas G0921, and G2532 certain G5100 other G0243 of G1537 them G0846, should go up G0305 (PresActInf) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419 unto G4314 the apostles G0652 and G2532 elders G4245 about G4012 this G5127 question G2213.
015:003 And G3303 G3767 being brought on their way G4311 (AorPasPtc) by G5259 the church G1577, they passed through G1330 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) Phenice G5403 and G2532 Samaria G4540, declaring G1555 (PresMidPasDepPtc) the conversion G1995 of the Gentiles G1484: and G2532 they caused G4160 (ImpfActInd) great G3173 joy G5479 unto all G3956 the brethren G0080.
015:004 And G1161 when they were come G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, they were received G0588 (AorPasInd) of G5259 the church G1577, and G2532 [of] the apostles G0652 and G2532 elders G4245, and G5037 they declared G0312 (AorActInd) all things G3745 that God G2316 had done G4160 (AorActInd) with G3326 them G0846.
015:005 But G1161 there rose up G1817 (Aor2ActInd) certain G5100 of G0575 the sect G0139 of the Pharisees G5330 which believed G4100 (PerfActPtc), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), That G3754 it was needful G1163 (PresInd) to circumcise G4059 (PresActInf) them G0846, and G5037 to command G3853 (PresActInf) [them] to keep G5083 (PresActInf) the law G3551 of Moses G3475.
015:006 And G1161 the apostles G0652 and G2532 elders G4245 came together G4863 (AorPasInd) for to consider G1492 (Aor2ActInf) of G4012 this G5127 matter G3056.
015:007 And G1161 when there had been G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) much G4183 disputing G4803, Peter G4074 rose up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, ye G5210 know G1987 (PresMidPasDepInd) how that G3754 a good G0744 while G2250 ago G0575 God G2316 made choice G1586 (AorMidInd) among G1722 us G2254, that the Gentiles G1484 by G1223 my G3450 mouth G4750 should hear G0191 (AorActInf) the word G3056 of the gospel G2098, and G2532 believe G4100 (AorActInf).
015:008 And G2532 God G2316, which knoweth the hearts G2589, bare them G0846 witness G3140 (AorActInd), giving G1325 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, even G2532 as G2531 [he did] unto us G2254;
015:009 And G2532 put G1252 no G3762 difference G1252 (AorActInd) between G3342 G5037 us G2257 and G2532 them G0846, purifying G2511 (AorActPtc) their G0846 hearts G2588 by faith G4102.
015:010 Now G3568 therefore G3767 why G5101 tempt ye G3985 (PresActInd) God G2316, to put G2007 (Aor2ActInf) a yoke G2218 upon G1909 the neck G5137 of the disciples G3101, which G3739 neither G3777 our G2257 fathers G3962 nor G3777 we G2249 were able G2480 (AorActInd) to bear G0941 (AorActInf)?
015:011 But G0235 we believe G4100 (PresActInd) that through G1223 the grace G5485 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 we shall be saved G4982 (AorPasInf), even G2596 G3739 as G5158 they G2548.
015:012 Then G1161 all G3956 the multitude G4128 kept silence G4601 (AorActInd), and G2532 gave audience G0191 (ImpfActInd) to Barnabas G0921 and G2532 Paul G3972, declaring G1834 (PresMidPasDepPtc) what G3745 miracles G4592 and G2532 wonders G5059 God G2316 had wrought G4160 (AorActInd) among G1722 the Gentiles G1484 by G1223 them G0846.
015:013 And G1161 after G3326 they had held G4601 their G0846 peace G4601 (AorActInf), James G2385 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, hearken G0191 (AorActImpr) unto me G3450:
015:014 Simeon G4826 hath declared G1834 (AorMidDepInd) how G2531 God G2316 at the first G4412 did visit G1980 (AorMidDepInd) the Gentiles G1484, to take G2983 (Aor2ActInf) out of G1537 them a people G2992 for G1909 his G0846 name G3686.
015:015 And G2532 to this G5129 agree G4856 (PresActInd) the words G3056 of the prophets G4396; as G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd),
015:016 After G3326 this G5023 I will return G0390 (FutActInd), and G2532 will build again G0456 (FutActInd) the tabernacle G4633 of David G1138, which G3588 is fallen down G4098 (PerfActPtc); and G2532 I will build again G0456 (FutActInd) the ruins G2679 (PerfPasPtc) thereof G0846, and G2532 I will set G0461 it G0846 up G0461 (FutActInd):
015:017 That G3704 G0302 the residue G2645 of men G0444 might seek after G1567 (AorActSubj) the Lord G2962, and G2532 all G3956 the Gentiles G1484, upon G1909 whom G3739 my G3450 name G3686 is called G1941 (PerfPasInd) G1909 G0846, saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Lord G2962, who G3588 doeth G4160 (PresActPtc) all G3956 these things G5023.
015:018 Known G1110 unto God G2316 are G2076 (PresInd) all G3956 his G0846 works G2041 from G0575 the beginning of the world G0165.
015:019 Wherefore G1352 my G1473 sentence is G2919 (PresActInd), that we trouble G3926 (PresActInf) not G3361 them, which G3588 from among G0575 the Gentiles G1484 are turned G1994 (PresActPtc) to G1909 God G2316:
015:020 But G0235 that we write G1989 (AorActInf) unto them G0846, that they abstain G0567 (PresMidInf) from G0575 pollutions G0234 of idols G1497, and G2532 [from] fornication G4202, and G2532 [from] things strangled G4156, and G2532 [from] blood G0129.
015:021 For G1063 Moses G3475 of G1537 old G0744 time G1074 hath G2192 (PresActInd) in every G2596 city G4172 them that preach G2784 (PresActPtc) him G0846, being read G0314 (PresPasPtc) in G1722 the synagogues G4864 every G2596 G3956 sabbath day G4521.
015:022 Then G5119 pleased it G1380 (AorActInd) the apostles G0652 and G2532 elders G4245, with G4862 the whole G3650 church G1577, to send G3992 (AorActInf) chosen G1586 (AorMidPtc) men G0435 of G1537 their own company G0846 to G1519 Antioch G0490 with G4862 Paul G3972 and G2532 Barnabas G0921; [namely], Judas G2455 surnamed G1941 (PresPasPtc) Barsabas G0923, and G2532 Silas G4609, chief G2233 (PresMidPasDepPtc) men G0435 among G1722 the brethren G0080:
015:023 And they wrote G1125 (AorActPtc) [letters] by G1223 them G5495 G0846 after this manner G3592; The apostles G0652 and G2532 elders G4245 and G2532 brethren G0080 [send] greeting G5463 (PresActInf) unto the brethren G0080 which G3588 are of G1537 the Gentiles G1484 in G2596 Antioch G0490 and G2532 Syria G4947 and G2532 Cilicia G2791:
015:024 Forasmuch as G1894 we have heard G0191 (AorActInd), that G3754 certain G5100 which went out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) from G1537 us G2257 have troubled G5015 (AorActInd) you G5209 with words G3056, subverting G0384 (PresActPtc) your G5216 souls G5590, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), [Ye must] be circumcised G4059 (PresPasInf), and G2532 keep G5083 (PresActInf) the law G3551: to whom G3739 we gave G1291 no G3756 [such] commandment G1291 (AorMidInd):
015:025 It seemed good G1380 (AorActInd) unto us G2254, being assembled G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) with one accord G3661, to send G3992 (AorActInf) chosen G1586 (AorMidPtc) men G0435 unto G4314 you G5209 with G4862 our G2257 beloved G0027 Barnabas G0921 and G2532 Paul G3972,
015:026 Men G0444 that have hazarded G3860 (PerfActPtc) their G0846 lives G5590 for G5228 the name G3686 of our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
015:027 We have sent G0649 (PerfActInd) therefore G3767 Judas G2455 and G2532 Silas G4609, who G0846 shall G0518 also G2532 tell G0518 (PresActPtc) [you] the same things G0846 by G1223 mouth G3056.
015:028 For G1063 it seemed good G1380 (AorActInd) to the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, and G2532 to us G2254, to lay upon G2007 (PresMidInf) you G5213 no G3367 greater G4119 burden G0922 than G4133 these G5130 necessary things G1876;
015:029 That ye abstain G0567 (PresMidInf) from meats offered to idols G1494, and G2532 from blood G0129, and G2532 from things strangled G4156, and G2532 from fornication G4202: from G1537 which G3739 if ye keep G1301 (PresActPtc) yourselves G1438, ye shall do G4238 (FutActInd) well G2095. Fare ye well G4517 (PerfPasImpr).
015:030 So G3303 G3767 when they were dismissed G0630 (AorPasPtc), they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Antioch G0490: and G2532 when they had gathered G4863 the multitude G4128 together G4863 (Aor2ActPtc), they delivered G1929 (AorActInd) the epistle G1992:
015:031 [Which] when G1161 they had read G0314 (Aor2ActPtc), they rejoiced G5463 (Aor2PasDepInd) for G1909 the consolation G3874.
015:032 And Judas G2455 and G2532 Silas G4609, being G5607 (PresPtc) prophets G4396 also G2532 themselves G0846, exhorted G3870 (AorActInd) the brethren G0080 with G1223 many G4183 words G3056, and G2532 confirmed G1991 (AorActInd) [them].
015:033 And G1161 after they had tarried G4160 (AorActPtc) [there] a space G5550, they were let go G0630 (AorPasInd) in G3326 peace G1515 from G0575 the brethren G0080 unto G4314 the apostles G0652.
015:034 Notwithstanding G1161 it pleased G1380 (AorActInd) Silas G4609 to abide G1961 there G0847 still G1961 (AorActInf).
015:035 Paul G3972 also G1161 and G2532 Barnabas G0921 continued G1304 (ImpfActInd) in G1722 Antioch G0490, teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) and G2532 preaching G2097 (PresMidPtc) the word G3056 of the Lord G2962, with G3326 many G4183 others G2087 also G2532.
015:036 And G1161 some G5100 days G2250 after G3326 Paul G3972 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 Barnabas G0921, G1211 Let us go again G1994 (AorActPtc) and visit G1980 (AorMidDepSubj) our G2257 brethren G0080 in G2596 every G3956 city G4172 where G1722 G3739 we have preached G2605 (AorActInd) the word G3056 of the Lord G2962, [and see] how G4459 they do G2192 (PresActInd).
015:037 And G1161 Barnabas G0921 determined G1011 (AorMidDepInd) to take with them G4838 (Aor2ActInf) John G2491, whose surname was G2564 (PresPasPtc) Mark G3138.
015:038 But G1161 Paul G3972 thought G0515 not G3361 good G0515 (ImpfActInd) to take G4838 him G5126 with them G4838 (Aor2ActInf), who G3588 departed G0868 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 them G0846 from G0575 Pamphylia G3828, and G2532 went G4905 (Aor2ActPtc) not G3361 with them G0846 to G1519 the work G2041.
015:039 And G3767 the contention G3948 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) so sharp G3948 between them G0846, that G5620 they departed asunder G0673 (AorPasInf) one from the other G0575 G0240: and so G5037 Barnabas G0921 took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) Mark G3138, and sailed G1602 (AorActInf) unto G1519 Cyprus G2954;
015:040 And G1161 Paul G3972 chose G1951 (AorMidPtc) Silas G4609, and departed G1831 (Aor2ActInd), being recommended G3860 (AorPasPtc) by G5259 the brethren G0080 unto the grace G5485 of God G2316.
015:041 And G1161 he went through G1330 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) Syria G4947 and G2532 Cilicia G2791, confirming G1991 (PresActPtc) the churches G1577.
016:001 ¶  Then G1161 came he G2658 (AorActInd) to G1519 Derbe G1191 and G2532 Lystra G3082: and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a certain G5100 disciple G3101 was G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563, named G3686 Timotheus G5095, the son G5207 of a certain G5100 woman G1135, which was a Jewess G2453, and believed G4103; but G1161 his father G3962 [was] a Greek G1672:
016:002 Which G3739 was well reported G3140 (ImpfPasInd) of by G5259 the brethren G0080 that were at G1722 Lystra G3082 and G2532 Iconium G2430.
016:003 Him G5126 would G2309 (AorActInd) Paul G3972 have to go forth G1831 (Aor2ActInf) with G4862 him G0846; and G2532 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) and circumcised G4059 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 because G1223 of the Jews G2453 which G3588 were G5607 (PresPtc) in G1722 those G1565 quarters G5117: for G1063 they knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) all G0537 that G3754 his G0846 father G3962 was G5225 (ImpfActInd) a Greek G1672.
016:004 And G1161 as G5613 they went through G1279 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) the cities G4172, they delivered G3860 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 the decrees G1378 for to keep G5442 (PresActInf), that were ordained G2919 (PerfPasPtc) of G5259 the apostles G0652 and G2532 elders G4245 which G3588 were at G1722 Jerusalem G2419.
016:005 And so G3303 G3767 were G4732 the churches G1577 established G4732 (ImpfPasInd) in the faith G4102, and G2532 increased G4052 (ImpfActInd) in number G0706 daily G2250 G2596.
016:006 Now G1161 when they had gone throughout G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) Phrygia G5435 and G2532 the region G5561 of Galatia G1054, and were forbidden G2967 (AorPasPtc) of G5259 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 to preach G2980 (AorActInf) the word G3056 in G1722 Asia G0773,
016:007 After they were come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G2596 Mysia G3465, they assayed G3985 (ImpfActInd) to go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) into G2596 Bithynia G0978: but G2532 the Spirit G4151 suffered G1439 (AorActInd) them G0846 not G3756.
016:008 And G1161 they passing by G3928 (Aor2ActPtc) Mysia G3465 came down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Troas G5174.
016:009 And G2532 a vision G3705 appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) to Paul G3972 in G1223 the night G3571; There stood G2258 (ImpfInd) G2476 (PerfActPtc) a man G5100 G0435 of Macedonia G3110, and prayed G3870 (PresActPtc) him G0846, G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Come over G1224 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 Macedonia G3109, and help G0997 (AorActImpr) us G2254.
016:010 And G1161 after G5613 he had seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the vision G3705, immediately G2112 we endeavoured G2212 (AorActInd) to go G1831 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 Macedonia G3109, assuredly gathering G4822 (PresActPtc) that G3754 the Lord G2962 had called G4341 (PerfMidPasDepInd) us G2248 for to preach the gospel G2097 (AorMidInf) unto them G0846.
016:011 Therefore G3767 loosing G0321 (AorPasPtc) from G0575 Troas G5174, we came with a straight course G2113 (AorActInd) to G1519 Samothracia G4543, and G5037 the next G1966 (PresPtc) [day] to G1519 Neapolis G3496;
016:012 And G5037 from thence G1564 to G1519 Philippi G5375, which G3748 is G2076 (PresInd) the chief G4413 city G4172 of that part G3310 of Macedonia G3109, [and] a colony G2862: and G1161 we were G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 that G5026 city G4172 abiding G1304 (PresActPtc) certain G5100 days G2250.
016:013 And G5037 on the sabbath G4521 G2250 we went G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1854 the city G4172 by G3844 a river side G4215, where G3757 prayer G4335 was wont G3543 (ImpfPasInd) to be made G1511 (PresInf); and G2532 we sat down G2523 (AorActPtc), and spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) unto the women G1135 which resorted G4905 (Aor2ActPtc) [thither].
016:014 And G2532 a certain G5100 woman G1135 named G3686 Lydia G3070, a seller of purple G4211, of the city G4172 of Thyatira G2363, which worshipped G4576 (PresMidPasDepPtc) God G2316, heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) [us]: whose G3739 heart G2588 the Lord G2962 opened G1272 (AorActInd), that she attended G4337 (PresActInf) unto the things which were spoken G2980 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 Paul G3972.
016:015 And G1161 when G5613 she was baptized G0907 (AorPasInd), and G2532 her G0846 household G3624, she besought G3870 (AorActInd) [us], saying G3004 (PresActPtc), If G1487 ye have judged G2919 (PerfActInd) me G3165 to be G1511 (PresInf) faithful G4103 to the Lord G2962, come G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 my G3450 house G3624, and abide G3306 (AorActImpr) [there]. And G2532 she constrained G3849 (AorMidDepInd) us G2248.
016:016 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as we G2257 went G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G1519 prayer G4335, a certain G5100 damsel G3814 possessed G2192 (PresActPtc) with a spirit G4151 of divination G4436 met G0528 (AorActInf) us G2254, which G3748 brought G3930 (ImpfActInd) her G0846 masters G2962 much G4183 gain G2039 by soothsaying G3132 (PresMidPasDepPtc):
016:017 The same G3778 followed G2628 (AorActPtc) Paul G3972 and G2532 us G2254, and cried G2896 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), These G3778 men G0444 are G1526 (PresInd) the servants G1401 of the most high G5310 God G2316, which G3748 shew G2605 (PresActInd) unto us G2254 the way G3598 of salvation G4991.
016:018 And G1161 this G5124 did she G4160 (ImpfActInd) G1909 many G4183 days G2250. But G1161 Paul G3972, being grieved G1278 (AorMidDepPtc), turned G1994 (AorActPtc) and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to the spirit G4151, I command G3853 (PresActInd) thee G4671 in G1722 the name G3686 of Jesus G2424 Christ G5547 to come G1831 (Aor2ActInf) out of G0575 her G0846. And G2532 he came out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) the same G0846 hour G5610.
016:019 And G1161 when her G0846 masters G2962 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 the hope G1680 of their G0846 gains G2039 was gone G1831 (Aor2ActInd), they caught G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) Paul G3972 and G2532 Silas G4609, and drew G1670 (AorActInd) [them] into G1519 the marketplace G0058 unto G1909 the rulers G0758,
016:020 And G2532 brought G4317 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846 to the magistrates G4755, saying G2036 (Aor2ActInd), These G3778 men G0444, being G5225 (PresActPtc) Jews G2453, do exceedingly trouble G1613 (PresActInd) our G2257 city G4172,
016:021 And G2532 teach G2605 (PresActInd) customs G1485, which G3739 are G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) for us G2254 to receive G3858 (PresMidPasDepInf), neither G3761 to observe G4160 (PresActInf), being G5607 (PresPtc) Romans G4514.
016:022 And G2532 the multitude G3793 rose up together G4911 (Aor2ActInd) against G2596 them G0846: and G2532 the magistrates G4755 rent off G4048 (AorActPtc) their G0846 clothes G2440, and commanded G2753 (ImpfActInd) to beat G4463 (PresActInf) [them].
016:023 And G5037 when they had laid G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) many G4183 stripes G4127 upon them G0846, they cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) [them] into G1519 prison G5438, charging G3853 (AorActPtc) the jailor G1200 to keep G5083 (PresActInf) them G0846 safely G0806:
016:024 Who G3739, having received G2983 (PerfActPtc) such G5108 a charge G3852, thrust G0906 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 into G1519 the inner G2082 prison G5438, and G2532 made G0805 their G0846 feet G4228 fast G0805 (AorMidDepInd) in G1519 the stocks G3586.
016:025 And G1161 at G2596 midnight G3317 Paul G3972 and G2532 Silas G4609 prayed G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and sang praises G5214 (ImpfActInd) unto God G2316: and G1161 the prisoners G1198 heard G1874 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) them G0846.
016:026 And G1161 suddenly G0869 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 earthquake G4578, so that G5620 the foundations G2310 of the prison G1201 were shaken G4531 (AorPasInf): and G5037 immediately G3916 all G3956 the doors G2374 were opened G0455 (AorPasInd), and G2532 every one’s G3956 bands G1199 were loosed G0447 (AorPasInd).
016:027 And G1161 the keeper of the prison G1200 awaking G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) out of his sleep G1853, and G2532 seeing G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the prison G5438 doors G2374 open G0455 (PerfPasPtc), he drew out G4685 (AorMidPtc) his sword G3162, and would G3195 (ImpfActInd) have killed G0337 (PresActInf) himself G1438, supposing G3543 (PresActPtc) that the prisoners G1198 had been fled G1628 (Perf2ActInf).
016:028 But G1161 Paul G3972 cried G5455 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Do G4238 (AorActSubj) thyself G4572 no G3367 harm G2556: for G1063 we are G2070 (PresInd) all G0537 here G1759.
016:029 Then G1161 he called G0154 (AorActPtc) for a light G5457, and sprang in G1530 (AorActInd), and G2532 came G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) trembling G1790, and fell down before G4363 (Aor2ActInd) Paul G3972 and G2532 Silas G4609,
016:030 And G2532 brought G4254 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846 out G1854, and said G5346 (ImpfInd), Sirs G2962, what G5101 must G1163 (PresInd) I G3165 do G4160 (PresActInf) to G2443 be saved G4982 (AorPasSubj)?
016:031 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Believe G4100 (AorActImpr) on G1909 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, and G2532 thou G4771 shalt be saved G4982 (FutPasInd), and G2532 thy G4675 house G3624.
016:032 And G2532 they spake G2980 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 the word G3056 of the Lord G2962, and G2532 to all G3956 that were in G1722 his G0846 house G3614.
016:033 And G2532 he took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846 G1722 the same G1565 hour G5610 of the night G3571, and washed G3068 (AorActInd) [their] stripes G0575 G4127; and G2532 was baptized G0907 (AorPasInd), he G0846 and G2532 all G3956 his G0846, straightway G3916.
016:034 And G5037 when he had brought G0321 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846 into G1519 his house G3624, he set G3908 meat G5132 before them G3908 (AorActInd), and G2532 rejoiced G0021 (AorMidDepInd), believing G4100 (PerfActPtc) in God G2316 with all G3832 his G0846 house G3832.
016:035 And G1161 when it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) day G2250, the magistrates G4755 sent G0649 (AorActInd) the serjeants G4465, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Let G0630 those G1565 men G0444 go G0630 (AorActImpr).
016:036 And G1161 the keeper of the prison G1200 told G0518 (AorActInd) this G5128 saying G3056 to G4314 Paul G3972, G3754 The magistrates G4755 have sent G0649 (PerfActInd) to G2443 let you go G0630 (AorPasSubj): now G3568 therefore G3767 depart G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) in G1722 peace G1515.
016:037 But G1161 Paul G3972 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto G4314 them G0846, They have beaten G1194 (AorActPtc) us G2248 openly G1219 uncondemned G0178, being G5225 (PresActPtc) Romans G4514 G0444, and have cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) [us] into G1519 prison G5438; and G2532 now G3568 do they thrust G1544 us G2248 out G1544 (PresActInd) privily G2977? nay G3756 verily G1063; but G0235 let them come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) themselves G0846 and fetch G1806 us G2248 out G1806 (Aor2ActImpr).
016:038 And G1161 the serjeants G4465 told G0312 (AorActInd) these G5023 words G4487 unto the magistrates G4755: and G2532 they feared G5399 (AorPasDepInd), when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 they were G1526 (PresInd) Romans G4514.
016:039 And G2532 they came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and besought G3870 (AorActInd) them G0846, and G2532 brought [them] out G1806 (Aor2ActPtc), and desired G2065 (ImpfActInd) [them] to depart out G1831 (Aor2ActInf) of the city G4172.
016:040 And G1161 they went G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G1537 the prison G5438, and entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 [the house of] Lydia G3070: and G2532 when they had seen G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the brethren G0080, they comforted G3870 (AorActInd) them G0846, and G2532 departed G1831 (Aor2ActInd).
017:001 ¶  Now G1161 when they had passed through G1353 (AorActPtc) Amphipolis G0295 and G2532 Apollonia G0624, they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Thessalonica G2332, where G3699 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a synagogue G4864 of the Jews G2453:
017:002 And G1161 Paul G3972, as G2596 his manner was G1486 (Perf2ActPtc), went in G1525 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, and G2532 G1909 three G5140 sabbath G4521 days reasoned G1256 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) with them G0846 out of G0575 the scriptures G1124,
017:003 Opening G1272 (PresActPtc) and G2532 alleging G3908 (PresMidPtc), that G3754 Christ G5547 must needs G1163 (ImpfInd) have suffered G3958 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 risen again G0450 (Aor2ActInf) from G1537 the dead G3498; and G2532 that G3754 this G3778 Jesus G2424, whom G3739 I G1473 preach G2605 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, is G2076 (PresInd) Christ G5547.
017:004 And G2532 some G5100 of G1537 them G0846 believed G3982 (AorPasInd), and G2532 consorted G4345 (AorPasInd) with Paul G3972 and G2532 Silas G4609; and G5037 of the devout G4576 (PresMidPasDepPtc) Greeks G1672 a great G4183 multitude G4128, and G5037 of the chief G4413 women G1135 not G3756 a few G3641.
017:005 But G1161 the Jews G2453 which believed not G0544 (PresActPtc), moved with envy G2206 (AorActPtc), G2532 took unto them G4355 (Aor2MidPtc) certain G5100 lewd G4190 fellows G0435 of the baser sort G0060, and G2532 gathered a company G3792 (AorActPtc), and set all G2350 the city G4172 on an uproar G2350 (ImpfActInd), and G5037 assaulted G2186 (Aor2ActPtc) the house G3614 of Jason G2394, and sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to bring G0071 (Aor2ActInf) them G0846 out G1519 to the people G1218.
017:006 And G1161 when they found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846 not G3361, they drew G4951 (ImpfActInd) Jason G2394 and G2532 certain G5100 brethren G0080 unto G1909 the rulers of the city G4173, crying G0994 (PresActPtc), G3754 These G3778 that have turned G0387 the world G3625 upside down G0387 (AorActPtc) are come G3918 (PresInd) hither G1759 also G2532;
017:007 Whom G3739 Jason G2394 hath received G5264 (PerfMidPasDepInd): and G2532 these G3778 all G3956 do G4238 (PresActInd) contrary G0561 to the decrees G1378 of Caesar G2541, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) that there is G1511 (PresInf) another G2087 king G0935, [one] Jesus G2424.
017:008 And G1161 they troubled G5015 (AorActInd) the people G3793 and G2532 the rulers of the city G4173, when they heard G0191 (PresActPtc) these things G5023.
017:009 And G2532 when they had taken G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) security G2425 of G3844 Jason G2394, and G2532 of the other G3062, they let G0630 them G0846 go G0630 (AorActInd).
017:010 And G1161 the brethren G0080 immediately G2112 sent away G1599 (AorActInd) G5037 Paul G3972 and G2532 Silas G4609 by G1223 night G3571 unto G1519 Berea G0960: who G3748 coming G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) [thither] went G0549 (ImpfInd) into G1519 the synagogue G4864 of the Jews G2453.
017:011 G1161 These G3778 were G2258 (ImpfInd) more noble G2104 than those in G1722 Thessalonica G2332, in that they G3748 received G1209 (AorMidDepInd) the word G3056 with G3326 all G3956 readiness of mind G4288, and searched G0350 (PresActPtc) the scriptures G1124 daily G2250 G2596, whether G1487 those things G5023 were G2192 (PresActOpt) so G3779.
017:012 Therefore G3767 G3303 many G4183 of G1537 them G0846 believed G4100 (AorActInd); also G2532 of honourable G2158 women G1135 which G3588 were Greeks G1674, and G2532 of men G0435, not G3756 a few G3641.
017:013 But G1161 when G5613 the Jews G2453 of G0575 Thessalonica G2332 had knowledge G1097 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 G2532 the word G3056 of God G2316 was preached G2605 (Aor2PasDepSubj) of G5259 Paul G3972 at G1722 Berea G0960, they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) thither also G2546, and stirred up G4531 (PresActPtc) the people G3793.
017:014 And G1161 then G5119 immediately G2112 the brethren G0080 sent away G1821 (AorActInd) Paul G3972 to go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) as it were G5613 to G1909 the sea G2281: but G1161 G5037 Silas G4609 and G2532 Timotheus G5095 abode G5278 there G1563 still G5278 (ImpfActInd).
017:015 And G1161 they that conducted G2525 (PresActPtc) Paul G3972 brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 unto G2193 Athens G0116: and G2532 receiving G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) a commandment G1785 unto G4314 Silas G4609 and G2532 Timotheus G5095 for to G2443 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) to G4314 him G0846 with all speed G5613 G5033, they departed G1826 (ImpfInd).
017:016 Now G1161 while Paul G3972 waited for G1551 (PresMidPasDepPtc) them G0846 at G1722 Athens G0116, his G0846 spirit G4151 was stirred G3947 (ImpfPasInd) in G1722 him G0846, when he saw G2334 (PresActPtc) the city G4172 wholly given G5607 (PresPtc) to idolatry G2712.
017:017 Therefore G3767 G3303 disputed he G1256 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) in G1722 the synagogue G4864 with the Jews G2453, and G2532 with the devout persons G4576 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 in G1722 the market G0058 daily G2596 G3956 G2250 with G4314 them that met with him G3909 (PresActPtc).
017:018 Then G1161 certain G5100 philosophers G5386 of the Epicureans G1946, and G2532 of the Stoicks G4770, encountered G4820 (ImpfActInd) him G0846. And G2532 some G5100 said G3004 (ImpfActInd), What G5101 will G0302 G2309 (PresActOpt) this G3778 babbler G4691 say G3004 (PresActInf)? G1161 other some, He seemeth G1380 (PresActInd) to be G1511 (PresInf) a setter forth G2604 of strange G3581 gods G1140: because G3754 he preached G2097 (ImpfMidInd) unto them G0846 Jesus G2424, and G2532 the resurrection G0386.
017:019 And G5037 they took G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) him G0846, and brought him G0071 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1909 Areopagus G0697, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), May G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) we know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) what G5101 this G3778 new G2537 doctrine G1322, whereof G5259 thou G4675 speakest G2980 (PresPasPtc), [is]?
017:020 For G1063 thou bringest G1533 (PresActInd) certain G5100 strange things G3579 (PresActPtc) to G1519 our G2257 ears G0189: we would G1014 (PresMidPasDepInd) know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) therefore G3767 what G5101 these things G5023 mean G0302 G2309 (PresActOpt) G1511 (PresInf).
017:021 (For G1161 all G3956 the Athenians G0117 and G2532 strangers G3581 which G3588 were there G1927 (PresActPtc) spent their time G2119 (ImpfActInd) in G1519 nothing G3762 else G2087, but either G2228 to tell G3004 (PresActInf), or G2532 to hear G0191 (PresActInf) some G5100 new thing G2537.)
017:022 Then G1161 Paul G3972 stood G2476 (AorPasPtc) in G1722 the midst G3319 of Mars’ hill G0697, and said G5346 (ImpfInd), [Ye] men G0435 of Athens G0117, I perceive G2334 (PresActInd) that G5613 in G2596 all things G3956 ye G5209 are too superstitious G1174.
017:023 For G1063 as I passed by G1330 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 beheld G0333 (PresActPtc) your G5216 devotions G4574, G2532 I found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) an altar G1041 with this G1722 G3739 inscription G1924 (PlupfPasInd), TO THE UNKNOWN G0057 GOD G2316. Whom G3739 therefore G3767 ye ignorantly G0050 (PresActPtc) worship G2151 (PresActInd), him G5126 declare G2605 (PresActInd) I G1473 unto you G5213.
017:024 God G2316 that made G4160 (AorActPtc) the world G2889 and G2532 all things G3956 therein G1722 G0846, seeing that he G3778 is G5225 (PresActPtc) Lord G2962 of heaven G3772 and G2532 earth G1093, dwelleth G2730 (PresActInd) not G3756 in G1722 temples G3485 made with hands G5499;
017:025 Neither G3761 is worshipped G2323 (PresPasInd) with G5259 men’s G0444 hands G5495, as though he needed G4326 (PresMidPasDepPtc) any thing G5100, seeing he G0846 giveth G1325 (PresActPtc) to all G3956 life G2222, and G2532 breath G4157, and G2596 all things G3956;
017:026 And G5037 hath made G4160 (AorActInd) of G1537 one G1520 blood G0129 all G3956 nations G1484 of men G0444 for to dwell G2730 (PresActInf) on G1909 all G3956 the face G4383 of the earth G1093, and hath determined G3724 (AorActPtc) the times G2540 before appointed G4384 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 the bounds G3734 of their G0846 habitation G2733;
017:027 That they should seek G2212 (PresActInf) the Lord G2962, if G1487 haply G0686 they might feel G5584 (AorActOpt) after him G0846, and G2532 find him G2147 (Aor2ActOpt), though G2544 he be G5225 (PresActPtc) not G3756 far G3112 from G0575 every G1538 one G1520 of us G2257:
017:028 For G1063 in G1722 him G0846 we live G2198 (PresActInd), and G2532 move G2795 (PresPasInd), and G2532 have our being G2070 (PresInd); as G5613 certain G5100 also G2532 of your G5209 own G2596 poets G4163 have said G2046 (PerfActInd), For G1063 we are G2070 (PresInd) also G2532 his G5120 offspring G1085.
017:029 Forasmuch then G3767 as we are G5225 (PresActPtc) the offspring G1085 of God G2316, we ought G3784 (PresActInd) not G3756 to think G3543 (PresActInf) that the Godhead G2304 is G1511 (PresInf) like G3664 unto gold G5557, or G2228 silver G0696, or G2228 stone G3037, graven G5480 by art G5078 and G2532 man’s G0444 device G1761.
017:030 And G3303 G3767 the times G5550 of this ignorance G0052 God G2316 winked at G5237 (AorActPtc); but now G3569 commandeth G3853 (PresActInd) all G3956 men G0444 every where G3837 to repent G3340 (PresActInf):
017:031 Because G1360 he hath appointed G2476 (AorActInd) a day G2250, in G1722 the which G3739 he will G3195 (PresActInd) judge G2919 (PresActInf) the world G3625 in G1722 righteousness G1343 by G1722 [that] man G0435 whom G3739 he hath ordained G3724 (AorActInd); [whereof] he hath given G3930 (Aor2ActPtc) assurance G4102 unto all G3956 [men], in that he hath raised G0450 (AorActPtc) him G0846 from G1537 the dead G3498.
017:032 And G1161 when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) of the resurrection G0386 of the dead G3498, some G3303 mocked G5512 (ImpfActInd): and G1161 others said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), We will hear G0191 (FutMidDepInd) thee G4675 again G3825 of G4012 this G5127 [matter].
017:033 So G2532 G3779 Paul G3972 departed G1831 (Aor2ActInd) from G1537 among G3319 them G0846.
017:034 Howbeit G1161 certain G5100 men G0435 clave G2853 (AorPasPtc) unto him G0846, and believed G4100 (AorActInd): among G1722 the which G3739 G2532 [was] Dionysius G1354 the Areopagite G0698, and G2532 a woman G1135 named G3686 Damaris G1152, and G2532 others G2087 with G4862 them G0846.
018:001 ¶  G1161 After G3326 these things G5023 Paul G3972 departed G5563 (AorPasPtc) from G1537 Athens G0116, and came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Corinth G2882;
018:002 And G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) a certain G5100 Jew G2453 named G3686 Aquila G0207, born G1085 in Pontus G4193, lately G4373 come G2064 (Perf2ActPtc) from G0575 Italy G2482, with G2532 his G0846 wife G1135 Priscilla G4252; (because that G1223 Claudius G2804 had commanded G1299 (PerfActInf) all G3956 Jews G2453 to depart G5563 (PresPasInf) from G1537 Rome G4516:) and came G4334 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846.
018:003 And G2532 because G1223 he was G1511 (PresInf) of the same craft G3673, he abode G3306 (ImpfActInd) with G3844 them G0846, and G2532 wrought G2038 (ImpfMidPasDepInd): for G1063 by their occupation G5078 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) tentmakers G4635.
018:004 And G1161 he reasoned G1256 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) in G1722 the synagogue G4864 G2596 every G3956 sabbath G4521, and G5037 persuaded G3982 (ImpfActInd) the Jews G2453 and G2532 the Greeks G1672.
018:005 And G1161 when G5613 G5037 Silas G4609 and G2532 Timotheus G5095 were come G2718 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 Macedonia G3109, Paul G3972 was pressed G4912 (ImpfPasInd) in the spirit G4151, and testified G1263 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to the Jews G2453 [that] Jesus G2424 [was] Christ G5547.
018:006 And G1161 when they opposed G0498 (PresMidPtc) themselves G0846, and G2532 blasphemed G0987 (PresActPtc), he shook G1621 (AorMidPtc) [his] raiment G2440, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Your G5216 blood G0129 [be] upon G1909 your G5216 own heads G2776; I G1473 [am] clean G2513: from G0575 henceforth G3568 I will go G4198 (FutMidDepInd) unto G1519 the Gentiles G1484.
018:007 And G2532 he departed G3327 (Aor2ActPtc) thence G1564, and entered G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a certain G5100 [man’s] house G3614, named G3686 Justus G2459, [one] that worshipped G4576 (PresMidPasDepPtc) God G2316, whose G3739 house G3614 joined hard G4927 (PresActPtc) G2258 (ImpfInd) to the synagogue G4864.
018:008 And G1161 Crispus G2921, the chief ruler of the synagogue G0752, believed G4100 (AorActInd) on the Lord G2962 with G4862 all G3650 his G0846 house G3624; and G2532 many G4183 of the Corinthians G2881 hearing G0191 (PresActPtc) believed G4100 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 were baptized G0907 (ImpfPasInd).
018:009 Then G1161 spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the Lord G2962 to Paul G3972 in G1223 the night G3571 by G1722 a vision G3705, Be G5399 not G3361 afraid G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr), but G0235 speak G2980 (PresActImpr), and G2532 hold G4623 not G3361 thy peace G4623 (AorActSubj):
018:010 For G1360 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) with G3326 thee G4675, and G2532 no man G3762 shall set on G2007 (FutMidInd) thee G4671 to hurt G2559 (AorActInf) thee G4571: for G1360 I G3427 have G2076 (PresInd) much G4183 people G2992 in G1722 this G5026 city G4172.
018:011 And G5037 he continued G2523 (AorActInd) [there] a year G1763 and G2532 six G1803 months G3376, teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) the word G3056 of God G2316 among G1722 them G0846.
018:012 And G1161 when Gallio G1058 was the deputy G0445 (PresActPtc) of Achaia G0882, the Jews G2453 made insurrection G2721 (Aor2ActInd) with one accord against G3661 Paul G3972, and G2532 brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 to G1909 the judgment seat G0968,
018:013 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 This G3778 [fellow] persuadeth G0374 (PresActInd) men G0444 to worship G4576 (PresMidPasDepInf) God G2316 contrary G3844 to the law G3551.
018:014 And G1161 when Paul G3972 was now about G3195 (PresActPtc) to open G0455 (PresActInf) [his] mouth G4750, Gallio G1058 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the Jews G2453, If G1487 G3303 G3767 it were G2258 (ImpfInd) a G5100 matter of wrong G0092 or G2228 wicked G4190 lewdness G4467, O G5599 [ye] Jews G2453, reason G2596 G3056 would G0302 that I should bear G0430 (Aor2MidDepInd) with you G5216:
018:015 But G1161 if G1487 it be G2076 (PresInd) a question G2213 of G4012 words G3056 and G2532 names G3686, and G2532 [of] G2596 your G5209 law G3551, look ye G3700 (FutMidDepInd) G0846 [to it]; for G1063 I G1473 will be G1014 (PresMidPasDepInd) G1511 (PresInf) no G3756 judge G2923 of such G5130 [matters].
018:016 And G2532 he drave G0556 (AorActInd) them G0846 from G0575 the judgment seat G0968.
018:017 Then G1161 all G3956 the Greeks G1672 took G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) Sosthenes G4988, the chief ruler of the synagogue G0752, and beat G5180 (ImpfActInd) [him] before G1715 the judgment seat G0968. And G2532 Gallio G1058 cared G3199 (ImpfActInd) for none G3762 of those things G5130.
018:018 And G1161 Paul G3972 [after this] tarried G4357 (AorActPtc) [there] yet G2089 a good G2425 while G2250, and then took his leave G0657 (AorMidPtc) of the brethren G0080, and sailed thence G1602 (ImpfActInd) into G1519 Syria G4947, and G2532 with G4862 him G0846 Priscilla G4252 and G2532 Aquila G0207; having shorn G2751 (AorMidPtc) [his] head G2776 in G1722 Cenchrea G2747: for G1063 he had G2192 (ImpfActInd) a vow G2171.
018:019 And G1161 he came G2658 (AorActInd) to G1519 Ephesus G2181, and G2548 left G2641 (Aor2ActInd) them there G0847: but G1161 he himself G0846 entered G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the synagogue G4864, and reasoned with G1256 (AorPasDepInd) the Jews G2453.
018:020 When G1161 they G0846 desired G2065 (PresActPtc) [him] to tarry G3306 (AorActInf) longer G1909 G4119 time G5550 with G3844 them G0846, he consented G1962 (AorActInd) not G3756;
018:021 But G0235 bade G0657 them G0846 farewell G0657 (AorMidDepInd), saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), I G3165 must G1163 (PresInd) by all means G3843 keep G4160 (AorActInf) this feast G1859 that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1519 Jerusalem G2414: but G1161 I will return G0344 (FutActInd) again G3825 unto G4314 you G5209, if God G2316 will G2309 (PresActPtc). And G2532 he sailed G0321 (AorPasInd) from G0575 Ephesus G2181.
018:022 And G2532 when he had landed G2718 (Aor2ActPtc) at G1519 Caesarea G2542, and gone up G0305 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 saluted G0782 (AorMidDepPtc) the church G1577, he went down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Antioch G0490.
018:023 And G2532 after he had spent G4160 (AorActPtc) some G5100 time G5550 [there], he departed G1831 (Aor2ActInd), and went over G1330 (PresMidPasDepPtc) [all] the country G5561 of Galatia G1054 and G2532 Phrygia G5435 in order G2517, strengthening G1991 (PresActPtc) all G3956 the disciples G3101.
018:024 And G1161 a certain G5100 Jew G2453 named G3686 Apollos G0625, born G1085 at Alexandria G0221, an eloquent G3052 man G0435, [and] mighty G5607 (PresPtc) G1415 in G1722 the scriptures G1124, came G2658 (AorActInd) to G1519 Ephesus G2181.
018:025 This man G3778 was G2258 (ImpfInd) instructed in G2727 (PerfPasPtc) the way G3598 of the Lord G2962; and G2532 being fervent G2204 (PresActPtc) in the spirit G4151, he spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) and G2532 taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) diligently G0199 the things of G4012 the Lord G2962, knowing G1987 (PresMidPasDepPtc) only G3440 the baptism G0908 of John G2491.
018:026 And G5037 he G3778 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to speak boldly G3955 (PresMidPasDepInf) in G1722 the synagogue G4864: whom G0846 when G1161 Aquila G0207 and G2532 Priscilla G4252 had heard G0191 (AorActPtc), they took G4355 (Aor2MidInd) him G0846 unto [them], and G2532 expounded G1620 (Aor2MidInd) unto him G0846 the way G3598 of God G2316 more perfectly G0197.
018:027 And G1161 when he G0846 was disposed G1014 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to pass G1330 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 Achaia G0882, the brethren G0080 wrote G1125 (AorActInd), exhorting G4389 (AorMidPtc) the disciples G3101 to receive G0588 (AorMidDepInf) him G0846: who G3739, when he was come G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc), helped them G4820 (Aor2MidInd) much G4183 which had believed G4100 (PerfActPtc) through G1223 grace G5485:
018:028 For G1063 he mightily G2159 convinced G1246 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) the Jews G2453, [and that] publickly G1219, shewing G1925 (PresActPtc) by G1223 the scriptures G1124 that Jesus G2424 was G1511 (PresInf) Christ G5547.
019:001 ¶  And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, while Apollos G0625 was G1511 (PresInf) G1722 at G1722 Corinth G2882, Paul G3972 having passed G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) through the upper G0510 coasts G3313 came G2064 (Aor2ActInf) to G1519 Ephesus G2181: and G2532 finding G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) certain G5100 disciples G3101,
019:002 He said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, G1487 Have ye received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 since ye believed G4100 (AorActPtc)? And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, G0235 We have G0191 not so much as G3761 heard G0191 (AorActInd) whether G1487 there be any G2076 (PresInd) Holy G0040 Ghost G4151.
019:003 And G5037 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Unto G1519 what G5101 then G3767 were ye baptized G0907 (AorPasInd)? And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Unto G1519 John’s G2491 baptism G0908.
019:004 Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Paul G3972, John G2491 verily G3303 baptized G0907 (AorActInd) with the baptism G0908 of repentance G3341, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto the people G2992, that G2443 they should believe G4100 (AorActSubj) on G1519 him which should come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) after G3326 him G0846, that is G5123 (PresInd), on G1519 Christ G5547 Jesus G2424.
019:005 When G1161 they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [this], they were baptized G0907 (AorPasInd) in G1519 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424.
019:006 And G2532 when Paul G3972 had laid G2007 [his] hands G5495 upon G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846, the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 them G0846; and G5037 they spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) with tongues G1100, and G2532 prophesied G4395 (ImpfActInd).
019:007 And G1161 all G3956 the men G0435 were G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5616 twelve G1177.
019:008 And G1161 he went G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the synagogue G4864, and spake boldly G3955 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) for the space G1909 of three G5140 months G3376, disputing G1256 (PresMidPasDepPtc) and G2532 persuading G3982 (PresActPtc) the things concerning G4012 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
019:009 But G1161 when G5613 divers G5100 were hardened G4645 (ImpfPasInd), and G2532 believed not G0544 (ImpfActInd), but spake evil G2551 (PresActPtc) of that way G3598 before G1799 the multitude G4128, he departed G0868 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 them G0846, and separated G0873 (AorActInd) the disciples G3101, disputing G1256 (PresMidPasDepPtc) daily G2596 G2250 in G1722 the school G4981 of one G5100 Tyrannus G5181.
019:010 And G1161 this G5124 continued G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) by the space G1909 of two G1417 years G2094; so G5620 that all G3956 they which dwelt in G2730 (PresActPtc) Asia G0773 heard G0191 (AorActInf) the word G3056 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424, both G5037 Jews G2453 and G2532 Greeks G1672.
019:011 And G5037 God G2316 wrought G4160 (ImpfActInd) special G3756 G5177 (Aor2ActPtc) miracles G1411 by G1223 the hands G5495 of Paul G3972:
019:012 So G2532 G5620 that from G0575 his G0846 body G5559 were brought G2018 (PresPasInf) unto G1909 the sick G0770 (PresActPtc) handkerchiefs G4676 or G2228 aprons G4612, and G2532 the diseases G3554 departed G0525 (PresPasInf) from G0575 them G0846, and G5037 the evil G4190 spirits G4151 went G1831 (PresMidPasDepInf) out of G0575 them G0846.
019:013 Then G1161 certain G5100 of G0575 the vagabond G4022 (PresMidPasDepPtc) Jews G2453, exorcists G1845, took upon them G2021 (AorActInd) to call G3687 (PresActInf) over G1909 them which had G2192 (PresActPtc) evil G4190 spirits G4151 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), We adjure G3726 (PresActInd) you G5209 by Jesus G2424 whom G3739 Paul G3972 preacheth G2784 (PresActInd).
019:014 And G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) seven G2033 sons G5207 of [one] Sceva G4630 G5100, a Jew G2453, [and] chief of the priests G0749, which did G4160 (PresActPtc) so G5124.
019:015 And G1161 the evil G4190 spirit G4151 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Jesus G2424 I know G1097 (PresActInd), and G2532 Paul G3972 I know G1987 (PresMidPasDepInd); but G1161 who G5101 are G2075 (PresInd) ye G5210?
019:016 And G2532 the man G0444 in G1722 whom G3739 the evil G4190 spirit G4151 was G2258 (ImpfInd) leaped G2177 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 them G0846, and G2532 overcame G2634 (AorActPtc) them G0846, and prevailed G2480 (AorActInd) against G2596 them G0846, so G5620 that they fled G1628 (Aor2ActInf) out of G1537 that G1565 house G3624 naked G1131 and G2532 wounded G5135 (PerfPasPtc).
019:017 And G1161 this G5124 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) known G1110 to all G3956 the Jews G2453 and G5037 Greeks G1672 also G2532 dwelling G2730 (PresActPtc) at Ephesus G2181; and G2532 fear G5401 fell G1968 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 them G0846 all G3956, and G2532 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 was magnified G3170 (ImpfPasInd).
019:018 And G5037 many G4183 that believed G4100 (PerfActPtc) came G2064 (ImpfMidPasDepInd), and confessed G1843 (PresMidPtc), and G2532 shewed G0312 (PresActPtc) their G0846 deeds G4234.
019:019 Many G2425 of them also G1161 which used G4238 (AorActPtc) curious arts G4021 brought G4851 their books G0976 together G4851 (Aor2ActPtc), and burned them G2618 (ImpfActInd) before G1799 all G3956 [men]: and G2532 they counted G4860 (AorActInd) the price G5092 of them G0846, and G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) [it] fifty G4002 thousand G3461 [pieces] of silver G0694.
019:020 So G3779 mightily G2596 G2904 grew G0837 (ImpfActInd) the word G3056 of God G2962 and G2532 prevailed G2480 (ImpfActInd).
019:021 After G1161 G5613 these things G5023 were ended G4137 (AorPasInd), Paul G3972 purposed G5087 (Aor2MidInd) in G1722 the spirit G4151, when he had passed through G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) Macedonia G3109 and G2532 Achaia G0882, to go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), After G3754 G3326 I G3165 have been G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) there G1563, I G3165 must G1163 (PresInd) also G2532 see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) Rome G4516.
019:022 So G1161 he sent G0649 (AorActPtc) into G1519 Macedonia G3109 two G1417 of them that ministered G1247 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, Timotheus G5095 and G2532 Erastus G2037; but he himself G0846 stayed G1907 (Aor2ActInd) in G1519 Asia G0773 for a season G5550.
019:023 And G1161 G2596 the same G1565 time G2540 there arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) no G3756 small G3641 stir G5017 about G4012 that way G3598.
019:024 For G1063 a certain G5100 [man] named G3686 Demetrius G1216, a silversmith G0695, which made G4160 (PresActPtc) silver G0693 shrines G3485 for Diana G0735, brought G3930 (ImpfMidInd) no G3756 small G3641 gain G2039 unto the craftsmen G5079;
019:025 Whom G3739 he called together G4867 (AorActPtc) with the workmen G2040 of G4012 like occupation G5108, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Sirs G0435, ye know G1987 (PresMidPasDepInd) that G3754 by G1537 this G5026 craft G2039 we have G2076 (PresInd) our G2257 wealth G2142.
019:026 Moreover G2532 ye see G2334 (PresActInd) and G2532 hear G0191 (PresActInd), that G3754 not G3756 alone G3440 at Ephesus G2181, but G0235 almost G4975 throughout all G3956 Asia G0773, this G3778 Paul G3972 hath persuaded G3982 (AorActPtc) and turned away G3179 (AorActInd) much G2425 people G3793, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) that G3754 they be G1526 (PresInd) no G3756 gods G2316, which G3588 are made G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with G1223 hands G5495:
019:027 So G1161 that not G3756 only G3440 this G5124 our G2254 craft G3313 is in danger G2793 (PresActInd) to be set G2064 (Aor2ActInf) at G1519 nought G0557; but G0235 also G2532 that the temple G2411 of the great G3173 goddess G2299 Diana G0735 should be despised G1519 G3762 G3049 (AorPasInf), and G1161 G2532 her G0846 magnificence G3168 should G3195 (PresActInf) be destroyed G2507 (PresPasInf), whom G3739 all G3650 Asia G0773 and G2532 the world G3625 worshippeth G4576 (PresMidPasDepInd).
019:028 And G1161 when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [these sayings], they were G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) full G4134 of wrath G2372, and G2532 cried out G2896 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Great G3173 [is] Diana G0735 of the Ephesians G2180.
019:029 And G2532 the whole G3650 city G4172 was filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with confusion G4799: and G5037 having caught G4884 (AorActPtc) Gaius G1050 and G2532 Aristarchus G0708, men of Macedonia G3110, Paul’s G3972 companions in travel G4898, they rushed G3729 (AorActInd) with one accord G3661 into G1519 the theatre G2302.
019:030 And G1161 when G1014 Paul G3972 would G1014 (PresMidPasDepPtc) have entered G1525 (Aor2ActInf) in G1519 unto the people G1218, the disciples G3101 suffered G1439 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 not G3756.
019:031 And G1161 G2532 certain G5100 of the chief of Asia G0775, which were G5607 (PresPtc) his G0846 friends G5384, sent G3992 (AorActPtc) unto G4314 him G0846, desiring G3870 (ImpfActInd) [him] that he would G1325 not G3361 adventure G1325 (Aor2ActInf) himself G1438 into G1519 the theatre G2302.
019:032 Some G0243 therefore G3767 G3303 cried G2896 (ImpfActInd) one thing G5100, and some another G0243: for G1063 the assembly G1577 was G2258 (ImpfInd) confused G4797 (PerfPasPtc); and G2532 the more part G4119 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756 wherefore G5101 G1752 they were come together G4905 (PlupfActInd).
019:033 And G1161 they drew G4264 (AorActInd) Alexander G0223 out of G1537 the multitude G3793, the Jews G2453 putting G4261 him G0846 forward G4261 (AorActPtc) G4261 (PresActPtc). And G1161 Alexander G0223 beckoned G2678 (AorActPtc) with the hand G5495, and would G2309 (ImpfActInd) have made his defence G0626 (PresMidPasDepInf) unto the people G1218.
019:034 But G1161 when they knew G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he was G2076 (PresInd) a Jew G2453, all G3956 G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) with G1537 one G3391 voice G5456 about G5613 the space G1909 of two G1417 hours G5610 cried out G2896 (PresActPtc), Great G3173 [is] Diana G0735 of the Ephesians G2180.
019:035 And G1161 when the townclerk G1122 had appeased G2687 (AorActPtc) the people G3793, he said G5346 (PresInd), [Ye] men G0435 of Ephesus G2180, what G5101 G1063 man G0444 is there G2076 (PresInd) that G3739 knoweth G1097 (PresActInd) not G3756 how that the city G4172 of the Ephesians G2180 is G5607 (PresPtc) a worshipper G3511 of the great G3173 goddess G2299 Diana G0735, and G2532 of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter G1356?
019:036 Seeing G5607 (PresPtc) then G3767 that these things G5130 cannot be spoken against G0368, ye G5209 ought G1163 (PresPtc) G2076 (PresInd) to be G5225 (PresActInf) quiet G2687 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 to do G4238 (PresActInf) nothing G3367 rashly G4312.
019:037 For G1063 ye have brought hither G0071 (Aor2ActInd) these G5128 men G0435, which are neither G3777 robbers of churches G2417, nor yet G3777 blasphemers G0987 (PresActPtc) of your G5216 goddess G2299.
019:038 Wherefore G3303 G3767 if G1487 Demetrius G1216, and G2532 the craftsmen G5079 which are with G4862 him G0846, have G2192 (PresActInd) a matter G3056 against G4314 any man G5100, the law G0060 is open G0071 (PresPasInd), and G2532 there are G1526 (PresInd) deputies G0446: let them implead G1458 (PresActImpr) one another G0240.
019:039 But G1161 if G1487 ye enquire G1934 (PresActInd) any thing G5100 concerning G4012 other matters G2087, it shall be determined G1956 (FutPasInd) in G1722 a lawful G1772 assembly G1577.
019:040 For G1063 G2532 we are in danger G2793 (PresActInd) to be called in question G1458 (PresPasInf) for G4012 this day’s G4594 uproar G4714, there being G5225 (PresActPtc) no G3367 cause G0158 whereby G4012 G3739 we may G1410 (FutMidDepInd) give G0591 (Aor2ActInf) an account G3056 of this G5026 concourse G4963.
019:041 And G2532 when he had G2036 thus G5023 spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), he dismissed G0630 (AorActInd) the assembly G1577.
020:001 ¶  And G1161 after G3326 the uproar G2351 was ceased G3973 (AorMidInf), Paul G3972 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) unto [him] the disciples G3101, and G2532 embraced G0782 (AorMidDepPtc) [them], and departed G1831 (Aor2ActInd) for to go G4198 (AorPasDepInf) into G1519 Macedonia G3109.
020:002 And G1161 when he had gone over G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) those G1565 parts G3313, and G2532 had given G4183 them G0846 much G4183 exhortation G3870 (AorActPtc) G3056, he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Greece G1671,
020:003 And G5037 [there] abode G4160 (AorActPtc) three G5140 months G3376. And when the Jews G5259 G2453 laid G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) wait G1917 for him G0846, as he was about G3195 (PresActPtc) to sail G0321 (PresPasInf) into G1519 Syria G4947, he purposed G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) G1106 to return G5290 (PresActInf) through G1223 Macedonia G3109.
020:004 And G1161 there accompanied G4902 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) him G0846 into G0891 Asia G0773 Sopater G4986 of Berea G0961; and G1161 of the Thessalonians G2331, Aristarchus G0708 and G2532 Secundus G4580; and G2532 Gaius G1050 of Derbe G1190, and G2532 Timotheus G5095; and G1161 of Asia G0774, Tychicus G5190 and G2532 Trophimus G5161.
020:005 These G3778 going before G4281 (Aor2ActPtc) tarried G3306 (ImpfActInd) for us G2248 at G1722 Troas G5174.
020:006 And G1161 we G2249 sailed away G1602 (AorActInd) from G0575 Philippi G5375 after G3326 the days G2250 of unleavened bread G0106, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846 to G1519 Troas G5174 in G0891 five G4002 days G2250; where G3757 we abode G1304 (AorActInd) seven G2033 days G2250.
020:007 And G1161 upon G1722 the first G3391 [day] of the week G4521, when the disciples G3101 came together G4863 (PerfPasPtc) to break G2806 (AorActInf) bread G0740, Paul G3972 preached G1256 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) unto them G0846, ready G3195 (PresActPtc) to depart G1826 (PresInf) on the morrow G1887; and G5037 continued G3905 (ImpfActInd) his speech G3056 until G3360 midnight G3317.
020:008 And G1161 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) many G2425 lights G2985 in G1722 the upper chamber G5253, where G3757 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) gathered together G4863 (PerfPasPtc).
020:009 And G1161 there sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1909 a window G2376 a certain G5100 young man G3494 named G3686 Eutychus G2161, being fallen G2702 (PresPasPtc) into a deep G0901 sleep G5258: and as Paul G3972 was long G1909 G4119 preaching G1256 (PresMidPasDepPtc), he sunk down G2702 (AorPasPtc) with G0575 sleep G5258, and fell down G2736 G4098 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 the third loft G5152, and G2532 was taken up G0142 (AorPasInd) dead G3498.
020:010 And G1161 Paul G3972 went down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc), and fell on G1968 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, and G2532 embracing G4843 (Aor2ActPtc) [him] said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Trouble G2350 not G3361 yourselves G2350 (PresPasImpr); for G1063 his G0846 life G5590 is G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 him G0846.
020:011 When G1161 he G0305 therefore was come up again G0305 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 had broken G2806 (AorActPtc) bread G0740, and G2532 eaten G1089 (AorMidDepPtc), and G5037 talked G3656 (AorActPtc) G1909 a long while G2425, even till G0891 break of day G0827, so G3779 he departed G1831 (Aor2ActInd).
020:012 And G1161 they brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) the young man G3816 alive G2198 (PresActPtc), and G2532 were G3870 not G3756 a little G3357 comforted G3870 (AorPasInd).
020:013 And G1161 we G2249 went before G4281 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1909 ship G4143, and sailed G0321 (AorPasInd) unto G1519 Assos G0789, there G1564 intending G3195 (PresActPtc) to take in G0353 (PresActInf) Paul G3972: for G1063 so G3779 had he G2258 (ImpfInd) appointed G1299 (PerfPasPtc), minding G3195 (PresActPtc) himself G0846 to go afoot G3978 (PresActInf).
020:014 And G1161 when G5613 he met G4820 (Aor2ActInd) with us G2254 at G1519 Assos G0789, we took G0353 him G0846 in G0353 (Aor2ActPtc), and came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Mitylene G3412.
020:015 And G2547 we sailed G0636 (AorActPtc) thence G2547, and came G2658 (AorActInd) the next G1966 (PresPtc) [day] over against G0481 Chios G5508; and G1161 the next G2087 [day] we arrived G3846 (Aor2ActInd) at G1519 Samos G4544, and G2532 tarried G3306 (AorActPtc) at G1722 Trogyllium G5175; and the next G2192 (PresPasPtc) [day] we came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Miletus G3399.
020:016 For G1063 Paul G3972 had determined G2919 (AorActInd) to sail by G3896 (AorActInf) Ephesus G2181, because G3704 he G0846 would G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) not G3361 spend the time G5551 (AorActInf) in G1722 Asia G0773: for G1063 he hasted G4692 (ImpfActInd), if G1487 it were G2258 (ImpfInd) possible G1415 for him G0846, to be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) at G1519 Jerusalem G2414 the day G2250 of Pentecost G4005.
020:017 And G1161 from G0575 Miletus G3399 he sent G3992 (AorActPtc) to G1519 Ephesus G2181, and called G3333 (AorMidInd) the elders G4245 of the church G1577.
020:018 And G1161 when G5613 they were come G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd) to G4314 him G0846, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Ye G5210 know G1987 (PresMidPasDepInd), from G0575 the first G4413 day G2250 that G0575 G3739 I came G1910 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Asia G0773, after what manner G4459 I have been G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) with G3326 you G5216 at all G3956 seasons G5550,
020:019 Serving G1398 (PresActPtc) the Lord G2962 with G3326 all G3956 humility of mind G5012, and G2532 with many G4183 tears G1144, and G2532 temptations G3986, which G3588 befell G4819 (Aor2ActPtc) me G3427 by G1722 the lying in wait G1917 of the Jews G2453:
020:020 [And] how G5613 I kept back G5288 (AorMidInd) nothing G3762 that was profitable G4851 (PresActPtc) [unto you], but G3361 have shewed G0312 (AorActInf) you G5213, and G2532 have taught G1321 (AorActInf) you G5209 publickly G1219, and G2532 from G2596 house to house G3624,
020:021 Testifying G1263 (PresMidPasDepPtc) both G5037 to the Jews G2453, and also G2532 to the Greeks G1672, repentance G3341 toward G1519 God G2316, and G2532 faith G4102 toward G1519 our G2257 Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547.
020:022 And G2532 now G3568, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd) bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) in the spirit G4151 unto G1519 Jerusalem G2419, not G3361 knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) the things that shall befall G4876 (FutActPtc) me G3427 there G1722 G0846:
020:023 Save G4133 that G3754 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 witnesseth G1263 (PresMidPasDepInd) in every G2596 city G4172, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) that G3754 bonds G1199 and G2532 afflictions G2347 abide G3306 (PresActInd) me G3165.
020:024 But G0235 none G3762 of these things G3056 move me G4160 (PresMidInd), neither G3761 count I G2192 (PresActInd) my G3450 life G5590 dear G5093 unto myself G1683, so G5613 that I might finish G5048 (AorActInf) my G3450 course G1408 with G3326 joy G5479, and G2532 the ministry G1248, which G3739 I have received G2983 (Aor2ActInd) of G3844 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424, to testify G1263 (AorMidDepInf) the gospel G2098 of the grace G5485 of God G2316.
020:025 And G2532 now G3568, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 ye G5210 all G3956, among G1722 whom G3739 I have gone G1330 (Aor2ActInd) preaching G2784 (PresActPtc) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) my G3450 face G4383 no more G3765.
020:026 Wherefore G1352 I take G3143 you G5213 to record G3143 (PresMidPasDepInd) this G1722 G4594 day G2250, that G3754 I G1473 [am] pure G2513 from G0575 the blood G0129 of all G3956 [men].
020:027 For G1063 I have G5288 not G3756 G3361 shunned G5288 (AorMidInd) to declare G0312 (AorActInf) unto you G5213 all G3956 the counsel G1012 of God G2316.
020:028 Take heed G4337 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767 unto yourselves G1438, and G2532 to all G3956 the flock G4168, over G1722 the which G3739 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 hath made G5087 (Aor2MidInd) you G5209 overseers G1985, to feed G4165 (PresActInf) the church G1577 of God G2316, which G3739 he hath purchased G4046 (AorMidInd) with G1223 his own G2398 blood G0129.
020:029 For G1063 I G1473 know G1492 (PerfActInd) this G5124, that G3754 after G3326 my G3450 departing G0867 shall grievous G0926 wolves G3074 enter in G1525 (FutMidDepInd) among G1519 you G5209, not G3361 sparing G5339 (PresMidPasDepPtc) the flock G4168.
020:030 Also G2532 of G1537 your G5216 own selves G0846 shall G0450 men G0435 arise G0450 (FutMidInd), speaking G2980 (PresActPtc) perverse things G1294 (PerfPasPtc), to draw away G0645 (PresActInf) disciples G3101 after G3694 them G0846.
020:031 Therefore G1352 watch G1127 (PresActImpr), and remember G3421 (PresActPtc), that G3754 by the space of three years G5148 I ceased G3973 (AorMidInd) not G3756 to warn G3560 (PresActPtc) every G1538 one G1520 night G3571 and G2532 day G2250 with G3326 tears G1144.
020:032 And G2532 now G3569, brethren G0080, I commend G3908 (PresMidInd) you G5209 to God G2316, and G2532 to the word G3056 of his G0846 grace G5485, which G3588 is able G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to build you up G2026 (AorActInf), and G2532 to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) you G5213 an inheritance G2817 among G1722 all G3956 them which are sanctified G0037 (PerfPasPtc).
020:033 I have coveted G1937 (AorActInd) no man’s G3762 silver G0694, or G2228 gold G5553, or G2228 apparel G2441.
020:034 Yea G1161, ye yourselves G0846 know G1097 (PresActInd), that G3754 these G3778 hands G5495 have ministered G5256 (AorActInd) unto my G3450 necessities G5532, and G2532 to them that were G5607 (PresPtc) with G3326 me G1700.
020:035 I have shewed G5263 (AorActInd) you G5213 all things G3956, how that G3754 so G3779 labouring G2872 (PresActPtc) ye ought G1163 (PresInd) to support G0482 (PresMidPasDepInf) the weak G0770 (PresActPtc), and G5037 to remember G3421 (PresActInf) the words G3056 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424, how G3754 he G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), It is G2076 (PresInd) more G3123 blessed G3107 to give G1325 (PresActInf) than G2228 to receive G2983 (PresActInf).
020:036 And G2532 when he had thus G5023 spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), he G0846 kneeled G1119 down G5087 (Aor2ActPtc), and prayed G4336 (AorMidDepInd) with G4862 them G0846 all G3956.
020:037 And G1161 they all G3956 wept G2805 G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) sore G2425, and G2532 fell G1968 (Aor2ActPtc) on G1909 Paul’s G3972 neck G5137, and kissed G2705 (ImpfActInd) him G0846,
020:038 Sorrowing G3600 (PresPasPtc) most of all G3122 for G1909 the words G3056 which G3739 he spake G2046 (PlupfActInd), that G3754 they should G3195 (PresActInd) see G2334 (PresActInf) his G0846 face G4383 no more G3765. And G1161 they accompanied G4311 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 unto G1519 the ship G4143.
021:001 ¶  And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that after G5613 we G2248 were gotten G0645 (AorPasPtc) from G0575 them G0846, and had launched G0321 (AorPasInf), we came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) with a straight course G2113 (AorActPtc) unto G1519 Coos G2972, and G1161 the [day] following G1836 unto G1519 Rhodes G4499, and from thence G2547 unto G1519 Patara G3959:
021:002 And G2532 finding G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) a ship G4143 sailing over G1276 (PresActPtc) unto G1519 Phenicia G5403, we went aboard G1910 (Aor2ActPtc), and set forth G0321 (AorPasInd).
021:003 Now G1161 when we had discovered G0398 (Aor2ActPtc) Cyprus G2954, G2532 we left G2641 (Aor2ActPtc) it G0846 on the left hand G2176, and sailed G4126 (ImpfActInd) into G1519 Syria G4947, and G2532 landed G2609 (Aor2PasDepSubj) at G1519 Tyre G5184: for G1063 there G1566 the ship G4143 was G2258 (ImpfInd) to unlade G0670 (PresMidPasDepPtc) her burden G1117.
021:004 And G2532 finding G0429 (Aor2ActPtc) disciples G3101, we tarried G1961 (AorActInd) there G0847 seven G2033 days G2250: who G3748 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) to Paul G3972 through G1223 the Spirit G4151, that he should G0305 not G3361 go up G0305 (PresActInf) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419.
021:005 And G1161 when G3753 we G2248 had G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) accomplished G1822 (AorActInf) those days G2250, we departed G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) and went our way G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd); and they all G3956 brought G4311 us G2248 on our way G4311 (PresActPtc), with G4862 wives G1135 and G2532 children G5043, till G2193 [we were] out of G1854 the city G4172: and G2532 we kneeled down G5087 (Aor2ActPtc) G1119 on G1909 the shore G0123, and prayed G4336 (AorMidDepInd).
021:006 And G2532 when we had taken our leave G0782 (AorMidDepPtc) one of another G0240, we took G1910 (Aor2ActInd) G1519 ship G4143; and G1161 they G1565 returned G5290 G1519 home G2398 again G5290 (AorActInd).
021:007 And G1161 when we G2249 had finished G1274 (AorActPtc) [our] course G4144 from G0575 Tyre G5184, we came G2658 (AorActInd) to G1519 Ptolemais G4424, and G2532 saluted G0782 (AorMidDepPtc) the brethren G0080, and abode G3306 (AorActInd) with G3844 them G0846 one G3391 day G2250.
021:008 And G1161 the next G1887 [day] we that were of G4012 Paul’s G3972 company G4012 departed G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 Caesarea G2542: and G2532 we entered G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the house G3624 of Philip G5376 the evangelist G2099, which was G5607 (PresPtc) [one] of G1537 the seven G2033; and abode G3306 (AorActInd) with G3844 him G0846.
021:009 And G1161 the same man G5129 had G2258 (ImpfInd) four G5064 daughters G2364, virgins G3933, which did prophesy G4395 (PresActPtc).
021:010 And G1161 as we G2257 tarried G1961 (PresActPtc) [there] many G4119 days G2250, there came down G2718 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 Judaea G2449 a certain G5100 prophet G4396, named G3686 Agabus G0013.
021:011 And G2532 when he was come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) unto G4314 us G2248, G2532 he took G0142 (AorActPtc) Paul’s G3972 girdle G2223, and G5037 bound G1210 (AorActPtc) his own G0846 hands G5495 and G2532 feet G4228, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Thus G3592 saith G3004 (PresActInd) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, So G3779 shall G1210 the Jews G2453 at G1722 Jerusalem G2419 bind G1210 (FutActInd) the man G0435 that G3739 owneth G2076 (PresInd) this G3778 girdle G2223, and G2532 shall deliver G3860 (FutActInd) [him] into G1519 the hands G5495 of the Gentiles G1484.
021:012 And G1161 when G5613 we heard G0191 (AorActInd) these things G5023, both G5037 we G2249, and G2532 they of that place G1786, besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 not G3361 to go up G0305 (PresActInf) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419.
021:013 Then G1161 Paul G3972 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), What G5101 mean ye G4160 (PresActInd) to weep G2799 (PresActPtc) and G2532 to break G4919 (PresActPtc) mine G3450 heart G2588? for G1063 I G1473 am G2192 (PresActInd) ready G2093 not G3756 to be bound G1210 (AorPasInf) only G3440, but G2532 also G0235 to die G0599 (Aor2ActInf) at G1519 Jerusalem G2419 for G5228 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424.
021:014 And G1161 when he G0846 would G3982 not G3361 be persuaded G3982 (PresPasPtc), we ceased G2270 (AorActInd), saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), The will G2307 of the Lord G2962 be done G1096 (Aor2MidDepImpr).
021:015 And G1161 after G3326 those G5025 days G2250 we took up our carriages G0643 (AorMidDepPtc), and went up G0305 (ImpfActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419.
021:016 G1161 There went G4905 (Aor2ActInd) with G4862 us G2254 also G2532 [certain] of the disciples G3101 of G0575 Caesarea G2542, and brought G0071 (PresActPtc) with them G3844 one G5100 Mnason G3416 of Cyprus G2953, an old G0744 disciple G3101, with whom G3739 we should lodge G3579 (AorPasSubj).
021:017 And G1161 when we G2257 were come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414, the brethren G0080 received G1209 (AorMidDepInd) us G2248 gladly G0780.
021:018 And G1161 the [day] following G1966 (PresPtc) Paul G3972 went in G1524 (PlupfActInd) with G4862 us G2254 unto G4314 James G2385; and G5037 all G3956 the elders G4245 were present G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd).
021:019 And G2532 when he had saluted G0782 (AorMidDepPtc) them G0846, he declared G1834 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) particularly G2596 G1520 G1538 what things G3739 God G2316 had wrought G4160 (AorActInd) among G1722 the Gentiles G1484 by G1223 his G0846 ministry G1248.
021:020 And G1161 when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], they glorified G1392 (ImpfActInd) the Lord G2962, and G5037 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thou seest G2334 (PresActInd), brother G0080, how many G4214 thousands G3461 of Jews G2453 there are G1526 (PresInd) which G3588 believe G4100 (PerfActPtc); and G2532 they are G5225 (PresActInd) all G3956 zealous G2207 of the law G3551:
021:021 And G1161 they are informed G2727 (AorPasInd) of G4012 thee G4675, that G3754 thou teachest G1321 (PresActInd) all G3956 the Jews G2453 which are among G2596 the Gentiles G1484 to G0575 forsake G0646 Moses G3475, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) that they G0846 ought G4059 not G3361 to circumcise G4059 (PresActInf) [their] children G5043, neither G3366 to walk G4043 (PresActInf) after the customs G1485.
021:022 What G5101 is it G2076 (PresInd) therefore G3767? the multitude G4128 must G1163 (PresInd) needs G3843 come together G4905 (Aor2ActInf): for G1063 they will hear G0191 (FutMidDepInd) that G3754 thou art come G2064 (Perf2ActInd).
021:023 Do G4160 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767 this G5124 that G3739 we say G3004 (PresActInd) to thee G4671: We G2254 have G1526 (PresInd) four G5064 men G0435 which have G2171 (PresActPtc) a vow G2192 on G1909 them G1438;
021:024 Them G5128 take G3880 (Aor2ActPtc), and purify thyself G0048 (AorPasImpr) with G4862 them G0846, and G2532 be at charges G1159 (AorActImpr) with G1909 them G0846, that G2443 they may shave G3587 (AorMidDepSubj) [their] heads G2776: and G2532 all G3956 may know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) that those things G3754, whereof G3739 they were informed G2727 (PerfPasInd) concerning G4012 thee G4675, are G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3762; but G0235 [that] thou thyself G0846 also G2532 walkest orderly G4748 (PresActInd), and keepest G5442 (PresActPtc) the law G3551.
021:025 As G1161 touching G4012 the Gentiles G1484 which believe G4100 (PerfActPtc), we G2249 have written G1989 (AorActInd) [and] concluded G2919 (AorActPtc) that they G0846 observe G5083 (PresActInf) no G3367 such thing G5108, save only G1508 that they keep G5442 (PresMidInf) themselves G0846 from G5037 [things] offered to idols G1494, and G2532 from blood G0129, and G2532 from strangled G4156, and G2532 from fornication G4202.
021:026 Then G5119 Paul G3972 took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) the men G0435, and the next G2192 (PresPasPtc) day G2250 purifying himself G0048 (AorPasPtc) with G4862 them G0846 entered G1524 (PlupfActInd) into G1519 the temple G2411, to signify G1229 (PresActPtc) the accomplishment G1604 of the days G2250 of purification G0049, until G2193 that G3739 an offering G4376 should be offered G4374 (AorPasInd) for G5228 every G1538 one G1520 of them G0846.
021:027 And G1161 when G5613 the seven G2033 days G2250 were almost G3195 (ImpfActInd) ended G4931 (PresPasInf), the Jews G2453 which were of G0575 Asia G0773, when they saw G2300 (AorMidDepPtc) him G0846 in G1722 the temple G2411, stirred up G4797 (ImpfActInd) all G3956 the people G3793, and G2532 laid G1911 (Aor2ActInd) hands G5495 on G1909 him G0846,
021:028 Crying out G2896 (PresActPtc), Men G0435 of Israel G2475, help G0997 (PresActImpr): This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the man G0444, that teacheth G1321 (PresActPtc) all G3956 [men] every where G3837 against G2596 the people G2992, and G2532 the law G3551, and G2532 this G5126 place G5117: and G5037 further G2089 brought G1521 (Aor2ActInd) Greeks G1672 also G2532 into G1519 the temple G2411, and G2532 hath polluted G2840 (PerfActInd) this G5127 holy G0040 place G5117.
021:029 (For G1063 they had G2258 (ImpfInd) seen before G4308 (PerfActPtc) with G4862 him G0846 in G1722 the city G4172 Trophimus G5161 an Ephesian G2180, whom G3739 they supposed G3543 (ImpfActInd) that G3754 Paul G3972 had brought G1521 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the temple G2411.)
021:030 And G5037 all G3650 the city G4172 was moved G2795 (AorPasInd), and G2532 the people G2992 ran together G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) G4890: and G2532 they took G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) Paul G3972, and drew G1670 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 out of G1854 the temple G2411: and G2532 forthwith G2112 the doors G2374 were shut G2808 (AorPasInd).
021:031 And G1161 as they went about G2212 (PresActPtc) to kill G0615 (AorActInf) him G0846, tidings G5334 came G0305 (Aor2ActInd) unto the chief captain G5506 of the band G4686, that G3754 all G3650 Jerusalem G2419 was in an uproar G4797 (PerfPasInd).
021:032 Who G3739 immediately G1824 took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) soldiers G4757 and G2532 centurions G1543, and ran down G2701 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1909 them G0846: and G1161 when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the chief captain G5506 and G2532 the soldiers G4757, they left G3973 (AorMidInd) beating G5180 (PresActPtc) of Paul G3972.
021:033 Then G5119 the chief captain G5506 came near G1448 (AorActPtc), and took G1949 (Aor2MidDepInd) him G0846, and G2532 commanded G2753 (AorActInd) [him] to be bound with G1210 (AorPasInf) two G1417 chains G0254; and G2532 demanded G4441 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) who G5101 he was G0302 G1498 (PresOpt), and G2532 what G5101 he had G2076 (PresInd) done G4160 (PerfActPtc).
021:034 And G1161 some G0243 cried G0994 (ImpfActInd) one thing G5100, some another G0243, among G1722 the multitude G3793: and G1161 when he could G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) not G3361 know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) the certainty G0804 for G1223 the tumult G2351, he commanded G2753 (AorActInd) him G0846 to be carried G0071 (PresPasInf) into G1519 the castle G3925.
021:035 And G1161 when G3753 he came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) upon G1909 the stairs G0304, so it was G4819 (Aor2ActInd), that he was borne G0941 (PresPasInf) of G5259 the soldiers G4757 for G1223 the violence G0970 of the people G3793.
021:036 For G1063 the multitude G4128 of the people G2992 followed after G0190 (ImpfActInd), crying G2896 (PresActPtc), Away G0142 (PresActImpr) with him G0846.
021:037 And G5037 as Paul G3972 was to be G3195 (PresActPtc) led G1521 (PresPasInf) into G1519 the castle G3925, he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto the chief captain G5506, May G1487 G1832 (PresInd) I G3427 speak G2036 (Aor2ActInf) G5100 unto G4314 thee G4571? G1161 Who G3588 said G5346 (ImpfInd), Canst thou speak G1097 (PresActInd) Greek G1676?
021:038 Art G1488 (PresInd) not G3756 thou G4771 G0686 that Egyptian G0124, which before G4253 these G5130 days G2250 madest an uproar G0387 (AorActPtc), and G2532 leddest out G1806 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the wilderness G2048 four thousand G5070 men G0435 that were murderers G4607?
021:039 But G1161 Paul G3972 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) G3303 a man G0444 [which am] a Jew G2453 of Tarsus G5018, [a city] in Cilicia G2791, a citizen G4177 of no G3756 mean G0767 city G4172: and G1161, I beseech G1189 (PresMidPasDepInd) thee G4675, suffer G2010 (AorActImpr) me G3427 to speak G2980 (AorActInf) unto G4314 the people G2992.
021:040 And G1161 when he had given G2010 him G0846 licence G2010 (AorActPtc), Paul G3972 stood G2476 (PerfActPtc) on G1909 the stairs G0304, and beckoned G2678 (AorActInd) with the hand G5495 unto the people G2992. And G1161 when there was made G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) a great G4183 silence G4602, he spake G4377 (AorActInd) unto [them] in the Hebrew G1446 tongue G1258, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
022:001 ¶  Men G0435, brethren G0080, and G2532 fathers G3962, hear ye G0191 (AorActImpr) my G3450 defence G0627 [which I make] now G3568 unto G4314 you G5209.
022:002 (And G1161 when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) that G3754 he spake G4377 (ImpfActInd) in the Hebrew G1446 tongue G1258 to them G0846, they kept G3930 (Aor2ActInd) the more G3123 silence G2271: and G2532 he saith G5346 (PresInd),)
022:003 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) verily G3303 a man G0435 [which am] a Jew G2453, born G1080 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 Tarsus G5019, [a city] in Cilicia G2791, yet G1161 brought up G0397 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 this G5026 city G4172 at G3844 the feet G4228 of Gamaliel G1059, [and] taught G3811 (PerfPasPtc) according G2596 to the perfect manner G0195 of the law G3551 of the fathers G3971, and was G5225 (PresActPtc) zealous G2207 toward God G2316, as G2531 ye G5210 all G3956 are G2075 (PresInd) this day G4594.
022:004 And I G3739 persecuted G1377 (AorActInd) this G5026 way G3598 unto G0891 the death G2288, binding G1195 (PresActPtc) and G2532 delivering G3860 (PresActPtc) into G1519 prisons G5438 both G5037 men G0435 and G2532 women G1135.
022:005 As G5613 also G2532 the high priest G0749 doth bear G3140 me G3427 witness G3140 (PresActInd), and G2532 all G3956 the estate of the elders G4244: from G3844 whom G3739 also G2532 I received G1209 (AorMidDepPtc) letters G1992 unto G4314 the brethren G0080, and G2532 went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to G1519 Damascus G1154, to bring G0071 (FutActPtc) them which were G5607 (PresPtc) there G1566 bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc) unto G1519 Jerusalem G2419, for to G2443 be punished G5097 (AorPasSubj).
022:006 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, as I made G4198 my G3427 journey G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 was come nigh G1448 (PresActPtc) unto Damascus G1154 about G4012 noon G3314, suddenly G1810 there shone G4015 from G1537 heaven G3772 a great G2425 light G5457 round G4015 (AorActInf) about G4012 me G1691.
022:007 And G5037 I fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 the ground G1475, and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActInd) a voice G5456 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto me G3427, Saul G4549, Saul G4549, why G5101 persecutest thou G1377 (PresActInd) me G3165?
022:008 And G1161 I G1473 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Who G5101 art thou G1488 (PresInd), Lord G2962? And G5037 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 me G3165, I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480, whom G3739 thou G4771 persecutest G1377 (PresActInd).
022:009 And G1161 they that were G5607 (PresPtc) with G4862 me G1698 saw G2300 (AorMidDepInd) indeed G3303 the light G5457, and G2532 were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) afraid G1719; but G1161 they heard G0191 (AorActInd) not G3756 the voice G5456 of him that spake G2980 (PresActPtc) to me G3427.
022:010 And G1161 I said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 shall I do G4160 (AorActSubj), Lord G2962? And G1161 the Lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 me G3165, Arise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) into G1519 Damascus G1154; and there G2546 it shall be told G2980 (FutPasInd) thee G4671 of G4012 all things G3956 which G3739 are appointed G5021 (PerfPasInd) for thee G4671 to do G4160 (AorActInf).
022:011 And G1161 when G5613 I could G1689 not G3756 see G1689 (ImpfActInd) for G0575 the glory G1391 of that G1565 light G5457, being led by the hand G5496 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 them that were G4895 (PresPtc) with me G3427, I came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Damascus G1154.
022:012 And G1161 one G5100 Ananias G0367, a devout G2152 man G0435 according G2596 to the law G3551, having a good report G3140 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 all G3956 the Jews G2453 which dwelt G2730 (PresActPtc) [there],
022:013 Came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) unto G4314 me G3165, and G2532 stood G2186 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto me G3427, Brother G0080 Saul G4549, receive thy sight G0308 (AorActImpr). And G2504 the same G0846 hour G5610 I G2504 looked up G0308 (AorActInd) upon G1519 him G0846.
022:014 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), The God G2316 of our G2257 fathers G3962 hath chosen G4400 (AorMidDepInd) thee G4571, that thou shouldest know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) his G0846 will G2307, and G2532 see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) that Just One G1342, and G2532 shouldest hear G0191 (AorActInf) the voice G5456 of G1537 his G0846 mouth G4750.
022:015 For G3754 thou shalt be G2071 (FutInd) his G0846 witness G3144 unto G4314 all G3956 men G0444 of what G3739 thou hast seen G3708 (PerfActInd) and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActInd).
022:016 And G2532 now G3568 why G5101 tarriest thou G3195 (PresActInd)? arise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and be baptized G0907 (AorMidImpr), and G2532 wash away G0628 (AorMidImpr) thy G4675 sins G0266, calling on G1941 (AorMidPtc) the name G3686 of the Lord G2962.
022:017 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, when I G3427 was come again G5290 (AorActPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, even G2532 while I G3450 prayed G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, I G3165 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) in G1722 a trance G1611;
022:018 And G2532 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto me G3427, Make haste G4692 (AorActImpr), and G2532 get thee G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) quickly G5034 G1722 out of G1537 Jerusalem G2419: for G1360 they will G3858 not G3756 receive G3858 (FutMidPasDepInd) thy G4675 testimony G3141 concerning G4012 me G1700.
022:019 And I G2504 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, they G0846 know G1987 (PresMidPasDepInd) that G3754 I G1473 imprisoned G2252 (ImpfInd) G5439 (PresActPtc) and G2532 beat G1194 (PresActPtc) in every G2596 synagogue G4864 them that believed G4100 (PresActPtc) on G1909 thee G4571:
022:020 And G2532 when G3753 the blood G0129 of thy G4675 martyr G3144 Stephen G4736 was shed G1632 (ImpfPasInd), I G0846 also G2532 was G2252 (ImpfInd) standing by G2186 (PerfActPtc), and G2532 consenting G4909 (PresActPtc) unto his G0846 death G0336, and G2532 kept G5442 (PresActPtc) the raiment G2440 of them that slew G0337 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
022:021 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 me G3165, Depart G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr): for G3754 I G1473 will send G1821 (FutActInd) thee G4571 far hence G3112 unto G1519 the Gentiles G1484.
022:022 And G1161 they gave G0191 him G0846 audience G0191 (ImpfActInd) unto G0891 this G5127 word G3056, and G2532 [then] lifted up G1869 (AorActInd) their G0846 voices G5456, and said G3004 (PresActPtc), Away with G0142 (PresActImpr) such G5108 a [fellow] from G0575 the earth G1093: for G1063 it is G2520 not G3756 fit G2520 (PresActPtc) that he G0846 should live G2198 (PresActInf).
022:023 And G1161 as they G0846 cried out G2905 (PresActPtc), and G2532 cast off G4495 (PresActPtc) [their] clothes G2440, and G2532 threw G0906 (PresActPtc) dust G2868 into G1519 the air G0109,
022:024 The chief captain G5506 commanded G2753 (AorActInd) him G0846 to be brought G0071 (PresPasInf) into G1519 the castle G3925, and bade G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) that he G0846 should be examined G0426 (PresPasInf) by scourging G3148; that G2443 he might know G1921 (Aor2ActSubj) wherefore G1223 G3739 G0156 they cried G2019 so G3779 against G2019 (ImpfActInd) him G0846.
022:025 And G1161 as G5613 they bound G4385 (AorActInd) G4385 (AorActInd) him G0846 with thongs G2438, Paul G3972 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the centurion G1543 that stood by G2476 (PerfActPtc), Is it lawful G1487 G1832 (PresInd) for you G5213 to scourge G3147 (PresActInf) a man G0444 that is a Roman G4514, and G2532 uncondemned G0178?
022:026 When G1161 the centurion G1543 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [that], he went G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and told G0518 (AorActInd) the chief captain G5506, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Take heed G3708 (PresActImpr) what G5101 thou doest G3195 (PresActInd) G4160 (PresActInf): for G1063 this G3778 man G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) a Roman G4514.
022:027 Then G1161 the chief captain G5506 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Tell G3004 (PresActImpr) me G3427, G1487 art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 a Roman G4514? G1161 He said G5346 (ImpfInd), Yea G3483.
022:028 And G5037 the chief captain G5506 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), With a great G4183 sum G2774 obtained G2932 (AorMidDepInd) I G1473 this G5026 freedom G4174. And G1161 Paul G3972 said G5346 (ImpfInd), But G1161 I G1473 G2532 was [free] born G1080 (PerfPasInd).
022:029 Then G3767 straightway G2112 they departed G0868 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 him G0846 which G3588 should G3195 (PresActPtc) have examined G0426 (PresActInf) him G0846: and G1161 the chief captain G5506 also G2532 was afraid G5399 (AorPasDepInd), after he knew G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he was G2076 (PresInd) a Roman G4514, and G2532 because G3754 he had G2258 (ImpfInd) bound G1210 (PerfActPtc) him G0846.
022:030 G1161 On the morrow G1887, because he would G1014 (PresMidPasDepPtc) have known G1097 (Aor2ActInf) the certainty G0804 wherefore G5101 he was accused G2723 (PresPasInd) of G3844 the Jews G2453, he loosed G3089 (AorActInd) him G0846 from G0575 [his] bands G1199, and G2532 commanded G2753 (AorActInd) the chief priests G0749 and G2532 all G3650 their G0846 council G4892 to appear G2064 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 brought G2609 Paul G3972 down G2609 (Aor2ActPtc), and set him G2476 (AorActInd) before G1519 them G0846.
023:001 ¶  And G1161 Paul G3972, earnestly beholding G0816 (AorActPtc) the council G4892, said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, I G1473 have lived G4176 (PerfPasInd) in all G3956 good G0018 conscience G4893 before God G2316 until G0891 this G5026 day G2250.
023:002 And G1161 the high priest G0749 Ananias G0367 commanded G2004 (AorActInd) them that stood by G3936 (PerfActPtc) him G0846 to smite G5180 (PresActInf) him G0846 on the mouth G4750.
023:003 Then G5119 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Paul G3972 unto G4314 him G0846, God G2316 shall G3195 (PresActInd) smite G5180 (PresActInf) thee G4571, [thou] whited G2867 (PerfPasPtc) wall G5109: for G2532 sittest G2521 (PresMidPasDepInd) thou G4771 to judge G2919 (PresActPtc) me G3165 after G2596 the law G3551, and G2532 commandest G2753 (PresActInd) me G3165 to be smitten G5180 (PresPasInf) contrary to the law G3891 (PresActPtc)?
023:004 And G1161 they that stood by G3936 (PerfActPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Revilest thou G3058 (PresActInd) God’s G2316 high priest G0749?
023:005 Then G5037 said G5346 (ImpfInd) Paul G3972, I wist G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756, brethren G0080, that G3754 he was G2076 (PresInd) the high priest G0749: for G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), Thou shalt G2046 not G3756 speak G2046 (FutActInd) evil G2560 of the ruler G0758 of thy G4675 people G2992.
023:006 But G1161 when Paul G3972 perceived G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 the one G1520 part G3313 were G2076 (PresInd) Sadducees G4523, and G1161 the other G2087 Pharisees G5330, he cried out G2896 (AorActInd) in G1722 the council G4892, Men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) a Pharisee G5330, the son G5207 of a Pharisee G5330: of G4012 the hope G1680 and G2532 resurrection G0386 of the dead G3498 I G1473 am called in question G2919 (PresPasInd).
023:007 And G1161 when he G0846 had G2980 so G5124 said G2980 (AorActPtc), there arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a dissension G4714 between the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 the Sadducees G4523: and G2532 the multitude G4128 was divided G4977 (AorPasInd).
023:008 For G1063 G3303 the Sadducees G4523 say G3004 (PresActInd) that there is G1511 (PresInf) no G3361 resurrection G0386, neither G3366 angel G0032, nor G3383 spirit G4151: but G1161 the Pharisees G5330 confess G3670 (PresActInd) both G0297.
023:009 And G1161 there arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a great G3173 cry G2906: and G2532 the scribes G1122 [that were] of the Pharisees G5330 ’ part G3313 arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and strove G1264 (ImpfMidPasDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), We find G2147 (PresActInd) no G3762 evil G2556 in G1722 this G5129 man G0444: but G1161 if G1487 a spirit G4151 or G2228 an angel G0032 hath spoken G2980 (AorActInd) to him G0846, let us G2313 not G3361 fight G2313 (PresActSubj) against God.
023:010 And G1161 when there arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) a great G4183 dissension G4714, the chief captain G5506, fearing G2125 (AorPasPtc) lest G3361 Paul G3972 should have been pulled in pieces G1288 (AorPasSubj) of G5259 them G0846, commanded G2753 (AorActInd) the soldiers G4753 to go down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc), and to take G0726 him G0846 by force G0726 (AorActInf) from G1537 among G3319 them G0846, and G5037 to bring G0071 (PresActInf) [him] into G1519 the castle G3925.
023:011 And G1161 the night G3571 following G1966 (PresPtc) the Lord G2962 stood by G2186 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Be of good cheer G2293 (PresActImpr), Paul G3972: for G1063 as G5613 thou hast testified G1263 (AorMidDepInd) of G4012 me G1700 in G1519 Jerusalem G2419, so G3779 must G1163 (PresInd) thou G4571 bear witness G3140 (AorActInf) also G2532 at G1519 Rome G4516.
023:012 And G1161 when it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) day G2250, certain G5100 of the Jews G2453 banded together G4160 (AorActPtc) G4963, and bound G0332 themselves G1438 under a curse G0332 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc) that they would G5315 neither G3383 eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) nor G3383 drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf) till G2193 G3739 they had killed G0615 (PresActSubj) Paul G3972.
023:013 And G1161 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) more than G4119 forty G5062 which G3588 had made G4160 (PerfActPtc) this G5026 conspiracy G4945.
023:014 And they G3748 came to G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) the chief priests G0749 and G2532 elders G4245, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), We have bound G0332 (AorActInd) ourselves G1438 under a great curse G0331, that we will eat G1089 (AorMidDepInf) nothing G3367 until G2193 G3739 we have slain G0615 (PresActSubj) Paul G3972.
023:015 Now G3568 therefore G3767 ye G5210 with G4862 the council G4892 signify G1718 (AorActImpr) to the chief captain G5506 that G3704 he bring G2609 him G0846 down G2609 (Aor2ActSubj) unto G4314 you G5209 to morrow G0839, as G5613 though ye would G3195 (PresActPtc) enquire G1231 (PresActInf) something more perfectly G0197 concerning G4012 him G0846: and G1161 we G2249, or ever G4253 he G0846 come near G1448 (AorActInf), are G2070 (PresInd) ready G2092 to kill G0337 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846.
023:016 And G1161 when Paul’s G3972 sister’s G0079 son G5207 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) of their lying in wait G1749, he went G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) and G2532 entered G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the castle G3925, and told G0518 (AorActInd) Paul G3972.
023:017 Then G1161 Paul G3972 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) one G1520 of the centurions G1543 unto [him], and said G5346 (ImpfInd), Bring G0520 (Aor2ActImpr) this G5126 young man G3494 unto G4314 the chief captain G5506: for G1063 he hath G2192 (PresActInd) a certain thing G5100 to tell G0518 (AorActInf) him G0846.
023:018 So G3767 G3303 he took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) [him] to G4314 the chief captain G5506, and G2532 said G5346 (PresInd), Paul G3972 the prisoner G1198 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) me G3165 unto [him], and prayed me G2065 (AorActInd) to bring G0071 (Aor2ActInf) this G5126 young man G3494 unto G4314 thee G4571, who hath G2192 (PresActPtc) something G5100 to say G2980 (AorActInf) unto thee G4671.
023:019 Then G1161 the chief captain G5506 took G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) him G0846 by the hand G5495, and G2532 went [with him] aside G0402 (AorActPtc) privately G2596 G2398, and asked G4441 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) [him], What G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) that G3739 thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) to tell G0518 (AorActInf) me G3427?
023:020 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), G3754 The Jews G2453 have agreed G4934 (Aor2MidInd) to desire G2065 (AorActInf) thee G4571 that G3704 thou wouldest bring down G2609 (Aor2ActSubj) Paul G3972 to morrow G0839 into G1519 the council G4892, as G5613 though they would G3195 (PresActPtc) enquire G4441 (PresMidPasDepInf) somewhat G5100 of G4012 him G0846 more perfectly G0197.
023:021 But G3767 do G3982 not G3361 thou G4771 yield G3982 (AorPasSubj) unto them G0846: for G1063 there lie in wait for G1748 (PresActInd) him G0846 of G1537 them G0846 more than G4119 forty G5062 men G0435, which G3748 have bound G0332 themselves G1438 with an oath G0332 (AorActInd), that they will G5315 neither G3383 eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) nor G3383 drink G4095 (Aor2ActInf) till G2193 G3739 they have killed G0337 (AorActSubj) him G0846: and G2532 now G3568 are they G1526 (PresInd) ready G2092, looking for G4327 (PresMidPasDepPtc) a promise G1860 from G0575 thee G4675.
023:022 So G3303 G3767 the chief captain G5506 [then] let G0630 the young man G3494 depart G0630 (AorActInd), and charged G3853 (AorActPtc) [him, See thou] tell G1583 (AorActInf) no man G3367 that G3754 thou hast shewed G1718 (AorActInd) these things G5023 to G4314 me G3165.
023:023 And G2532 he called unto G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) [him] G5100 two G1417 centurions G1543, saying G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Make ready G2090 (AorActImpr) two hundred G1250 soldiers G4757 to G3704 go G4198 (AorPasDepSubj) to G2193 Caesarea G2542, and G2532 horsemen G2460 threescore and ten G1440, and G2532 spearmen G1187 two hundred G1250, at G0575 the third G5154 hour G5610 of the night G3571;
023:024 And G5037 provide G3936 (AorActInf) [them] beasts G2934, that G2443 they may set G1913 Paul G3972 on G1913 (AorActPtc), and bring [him] safe G1295 (AorActSubj) unto G4314 Felix G5344 the governor G2232.
023:025 And he wrote G1125 (AorActPtc) a letter G1992 after G4023 (PresActPtc) this G5126 manner G5179:
023:026 Claudius G2804 Lysias G3079 unto the most excellent G2903 governor G2232 Felix G5344 [sendeth] greeting G5463 (PresActInf).
023:027 This G5126 man G0435 was taken G4815 (AorPasPtc) of G5259 the Jews G2453, and G2532 should G3195 (PresActPtc) have been killed G0337 (PresPasInf) of G5259 them G0846: then came I G2186 (Aor2ActPtc) with G4862 an army G4753, and rescued G1807 (Aor2MidInd) him G0846, having understood G3129 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he was G2076 (PresInd) a Roman G4514.
023:028 And G1161 when G1014 I would G1014 (PresMidPasDepPtc) have known G1097 (Aor2ActInf) the cause G0156 wherefore G1223 G3739 they accused G1458 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, I brought G2609 him G0846 forth G2609 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 their G0846 council G4892:
023:029 Whom G3739 I perceived G2147 (Aor2ActInd) to be accused G1458 (PresPasPtc) of G4012 questions G2213 of their G0846 law G3551, but G1161 to have G2192 (PresActPtc) nothing G3367 laid to his charge G1462 worthy G0514 of death G2288 or G2228 of bonds G1199.
023:030 And G1161 when it was told G3377 (AorPasPtc) me G3427 how that G5259 the Jews G2453 laid wait G1917 G3195 (PresActInf) G1510 (FutInf) for G1519 the man G0435, I sent G3992 (AorActInd) straightway G1824 to G4314 thee G4571, and gave commandment G3853 (AorActPtc) to his accusers G2725 also G2532 to say G3004 (PresActInf) before G1909 thee G4675 what [they had] against G4314 him G0846. Farewell G4517 (PerfPasImpr).
023:031 Then G3767 G3303 the soldiers G4757, as G2596 it was commanded G1299 (PerfPasPtc) them G0846, took G0353 (Aor2ActPtc) Paul G3972, and brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) [him] by G1223 night G3571 to G1519 Antipatris G0494.
023:032 G1161 On the morrow G1887 they left G1439 (AorActPtc) the horsemen G2460 to go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) with G4862 him G0846, and returned G5290 (AorActInd) to G1519 the castle G3925:
023:033 Who G3748, when they came G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 Caesarea G2542, and G2532 delivered G0325 (Aor2ActPtc) the epistle G1992 to the governor G2232, presented G3936 (AorActInd) Paul G3972 also G2532 before him G0846.
023:034 And G1161 when the governor G2232 had read G0314 (Aor2ActPtc) [the letter], G2532 he asked G1905 (AorActPtc) of G1537 what G4169 province G1885 he was G2076 (PresInd). And G2532 when he understood G4441 (Aor2MidDepPtc) that G3754 [he was] of G0575 Cilicia G2791;
023:035 I will hear G1251 (FutMidDepInd) thee G4675, said he G5346 (ImpfInd), when G3752 thine G4675 accusers G2725 are G3854 also G2532 come G3854 (Aor2MidDepSubj). And G5037 he commanded G2753 (AorActInd) him G0846 to be kept G5442 (PresMidInf) in G1722 Herod’s G2264 judgment hall G4232.
024:001 ¶  And G1161 after G3326 five G4002 days G2250 Ananias G0367 the high priest G0749 descended G2597 (Aor2ActInd) with G3326 the elders G4245, and G2532 [with] a certain G5100 orator G4489 [named] Tertullus G5061, who G3748 informed G1718 (AorActInd) the governor G2232 against G2596 Paul G3972.
024:002 And G1161 when he G0846 was called forth G2564 (AorPasPtc), Tertullus G5061 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to accuse G2723 (PresActInf) [him], saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Seeing that by G1223 thee G4675 we enjoy G5177 (PresActPtc) great G4183 quietness G1515, and G2532 that very worthy deeds G2735 are done G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) unto this G5129 nation G1484 by G1223 thy G4674 providence G4307,
024:003 G5037 We accept G0588 (PresMidPasDepInd) [it] always G3839, and G2532 in all places G3837, most noble G2903 Felix G5344, with G3326 all G3956 thankfulness G2169.
024:004 Notwithstanding G1161, that G3363 I be G4119 not G3363 G1909 further G4119 tedious G1465 (PresActSubj) unto thee G4571, I pray G3870 (PresActInd) thee G4571 that thou wouldest hear G0191 (AorActInf) us G2257 of thy G4674 clemency G1932 a few words G4935.
024:005 For G1063 we have found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) this G5126 man G0435 [a] pestilent G3061 [fellow], and G2532 a mover G2795 (PresActPtc) of sedition G4714 among all G3956 the Jews G2453 throughout G2596 the world G3625, and G5037 a ringleader G4414 of the sect G0139 of the Nazarenes G3480:
024:006 Who G3739 also G2532 hath gone about G3985 (ImpfActInd) to profane G0953 (AorActInf) the temple G2411: G2532 whom G3739 we took G2902 (AorActInd), and G2532 would G2309 (AorActInd) have judged G2919 (PresActInf) according G2596 to our G2251 law G3551.
024:007 But G1161 the chief captain G5506 Lysias G3079 came G3928 (Aor2ActPtc) [upon us], and with G3326 great G4183 violence G0970 took [him] away G0520 (Aor2ActInd) out of G1537 our G2257 hands G5495,
024:008 Commanding G2753 (AorActPtc) his G0846 accusers G2725 to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInf) unto G1909 thee G4571: by examining G0350 (AorActPtc) of G3844 whom G3739 thyself G0846 mayest G1410 (FutMidDepInd) take knowledge G1921 (Aor2ActInf) of G4012 all G3956 these things G5130, whereof G3739 we G2249 accuse G2723 (PresActInd) him G0846.
024:009 And G1161 the Jews G2453 also G2532 assented G4934 (Aor2MidInd), saying G5335 (PresActPtc) that these things G5023 were G2192 (PresActInf) so G3779.
024:010 Then G1161 Paul G3972, after that the governor G2232 had beckoned G3506 (AorActPtc) unto him G0846 to speak G3004 (PresActInf), answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Forasmuch as I know G1987 (PresMidPasDepPtc) that thou G4571 hast been G5607 (PresPtc) of G1537 many G4183 years G2094 a judge G2923 unto this G5129 nation G1484, I do G0626 the more cheerfully G2115 answer G0626 (PresMidPasDepInd) for G4012 myself G1683:
024:011 Because that thou G4675 mayest G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) understand G1097 (Aor2ActInf), that G3754 there are G1526 (PresInd) yet but G2228 G3756 twelve G1177 days G2250 G4119 since G0575 G3739 I G3427 went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) to G1722 Jerusalem G2419 for to worship G4352 (FutActPtc).
024:012 And G2532 they neither G3777 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) me G3165 in G1722 the temple G2411 disputing G1256 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with G4314 any man G5100, neither G2228 raising up G1999 G4160 (PresActPtc) the people G3793 G1999, neither G3777 in G1722 the synagogues G4864, nor G3777 in G2596 the city G4172:
024:013 Neither G3777 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) they prove G3936 (AorActInf) G3165 the things G4012 whereof G3739 they G2723 now G3568 accuse G2723 (PresActInd) me G3450.
024:014 But G1161 this G5124 I confess G3670 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, that G3754 after G2596 the way G3598 which G3739 they call G3004 (PresActInd) heresy G0139, so G3779 worship I G3000 (PresActInd) the God G2316 of my fathers G3971, believing G4100 (PresActPtc) all things G3956 which G3588 are written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G2596 the law G3551 and G2532 in G1722 the prophets G4396:
024:015 And have G2192 (PresActPtc) hope G1680 toward G1519 God G2316, which G3739 they G3778 themselves G0846 also G2532 allow G4327 (PresMidPasDepInd), that there shall be G3195 (PresActInf) G1510 (FutInf) a resurrection G0386 of the dead G3498, both G5037 of the just G1342 and G2532 unjust G0094.
024:016 And G1161 herein G1722 G5129 do I exercise G0778 (PresActInd) myself G0846, to have G2192 (PresActInf) always G1275 a conscience G4893 void of offence G0677 toward G4314 God G2316, and G2532 [toward] men G0444.
024:017 Now G1161 after G1223 many G4119 years G2094 I came G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd) to bring G4160 (FutActPtc) alms G1654 to G1519 my G3450 nation G1484, and G2532 offerings G4376.
024:018 G1161 Whereupon G1722 G3739 certain G5100 Jews G2453 from G0575 Asia G0773 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) me G3165 purified G0048 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411, neither G3756 with G3326 multitude G3793, nor G3761 with G3326 tumult G2351.
024:019 Who G3739 ought G1163 (PresInd) G1163 (ImpfInd) to have been here G3918 (PresInf) before G1909 thee G4675, and G2532 object G2723 (PresActInf), if G1536 they had G2192 (PresActOpt) ought G1536 against G4314 me G3165.
024:020 Or else G2228 let G2036 these G0846 same G3778 [here] say G2036 (Aor2ActImpr), if G1536 they have found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) any G1536 evil doing G0092 in G1722 me G1698, while I G3450 stood G2476 (Aor2ActPtc) before G1909 the council G4892,
024:021 Except G2228 it be for G4012 this G5026 one G3391 voice G5456, that G3739 I cried G2896 (AorActInd) standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) among G1722 them G0846, Touching G3754 G4012 the resurrection G0386 of the dead G3498 I G1473 am called in question G2919 (PresPasInd) by G5259 you G5216 this day G4594.
024:022 And G1161 when Felix G5344 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) these things G5023, having more perfect G0197 knowledge G1492 (PerfActPtc) of G4012 [that] way G3598, he deferred G0306 (Aor2MidInd) them G0846, and said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), When G3752 Lysias G3079 the chief captain G5506 shall come down G2597 (Aor2ActSubj), I will know the uttermost G1231 (FutMidDepInd) of your G5209 matter G2596.
024:023 And G5037 he commanded G1299 (AorMidPtc) a centurion G1543 to keep G5083 (PresPasInf) Paul G3972, and G5037 to let [him] have G2192 (PresActInf) liberty G0425, and G2532 that he should forbid G2967 (PresActInf) none G3367 of his G0846 acquaintance G2398 to minister G5256 (PresActInf) or G2228 come G4334 (PresMidPasDepInf) unto him G0846.
024:024 And G1161 after G3326 certain G5100 days G2250, when Felix G5344 came G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) with G4862 his G0846 wife G1135 Drusilla G1409, which was G5607 (PresPtc) a Jewess G2453, he sent for G3343 (AorMidDepInd) Paul G3972, and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActInd) him G0846 concerning G4012 the faith G4102 in G1519 Christ G5547.
024:025 And G1161 as he G0846 reasoned G1256 (PresMidPasDepPtc) of G4012 righteousness G1343, temperance G2532 G1466, and G2532 judgment G2917 to come G3195 (PresActPtc) G1510 (FutInf), Felix G5344 trembled G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) G1719, and answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Go thy way G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) for this time G3568; when G1161 I have G2192 (PresActPtc) G3335 (Aor2ActPtc) a convenient season G2540, I will call for G3333 (FutMidInd) thee G4571.
024:026 He hoped G1679 (PresActPtc) also G0260 G1161 G2532 that G3754 money G5536 should have been given G1325 (FutPasInd) him G0846 of G5259 Paul G3972, that G3704 he might loose G3089 (AorActSubj) him G0846: wherefore G1352 he sent for G3343 (PresMidPasDepPtc) him G0846 the oftener G4437, and G2532 communed with G3656 (ImpfActInd) him G0846.
024:027 But G1161 after G4137 (AorPasPtc) two years G1333 Porcius G4201 Festus G5347 came G2983 (Aor2ActInd) into Felix G5344 ’ room G1240: and G5037 Felix G5344, willing G2309 (PresActPtc) to shew G2698 (Aor2MidInf) the Jews G2453 a pleasure G5485, left G2641 (Aor2ActInd) Paul G3972 bound G1210 (PerfPasPtc).
025:001 ¶  Now G3767 when Festus G5347 was come G1910 (Aor2ActPtc) into the province G1885, after G3326 three G5140 days G2250 he ascended G0305 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 Caesarea G2542 to G1519 Jerusalem G2414.
025:002 Then G1161 the high priest G0749 and G2532 the chief G4413 of the Jews G2453 informed G1718 (AorActInd) him G0846 against G2596 Paul G3972, and G2532 besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846,
025:003 And desired G0154 (PresMidPtc) favour G5485 against G2596 him G0846, that G3704 he would send for G3343 (AorMidDepSubj) him G0846 to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, laying G4160 (PresActPtc) wait G1747 in G2596 the way G3598 to kill G0337 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846.
025:004 But G3303 G3767 Festus G5347 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), that Paul G3972 should be kept G5083 (PresPasInf) at G1722 Caesarea G2542, and G1161 that he himself G1438 would G3195 (PresActInf) depart G1607 (PresMidPasDepInf) G1722 shortly G5034 [thither].
025:005 Let them therefore G3767, said G5346 (PresInd) he, which among G1722 you G5213 are able G1415, go down with G4782 (Aor2ActPtc) [me], and accuse G2723 (PresActImpr) this G0846 man G0435, if G1536 there be G2076 (PresInd) any wickedness G1536 in G1722 him G5129.
025:006 And G1161 when he had tarried G1304 (AorActPtc) among G1722 them G0846 more G4119 than G2228 ten G1176 days G2250, he went down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) unto G1519 Caesarea G2542; and the next day G1887 sitting G2523 (AorActPtc) on G1909 the judgment seat G0968 commanded G2753 (AorActInd) Paul G3972 to be brought G0071 (AorPasInf).
025:007 And G1161 when he G0846 was come G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc), the Jews G2453 which came down G2597 (PerfActPtc) from G0575 Jerusalem G2414 stood round about G4026 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 laid G5342 (PresActPtc) many G4183 and grievous G0926 complaints G0157 against G2596 Paul G3972, which G3739 they could G2480 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 prove G0584 (AorActInf).
025:008 While he answered G0626 (PresMidPasDepPtc) for himself G0846, Neither G3754 G3777 against G1519 the law G3551 of the Jews G2453, neither G3777 against G1519 the temple G2411, nor yet G3777 against G1519 Caesar G2541, have I offended G0264 (Aor2ActInd) any thing at all G5100.
025:009 But G1161 Festus G5347, willing G2309 (PresActPtc) to do G2698 (Aor2MidInf) the Jews G2453 a pleasure G5485, answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) Paul G3972, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd) go up G0305 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414, and there G1563 be judged G2919 (PresPasInf) of G4012 these things G5130 before G1909 me G1700?
025:010 Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Paul G3972, I stand G1510 (PresInd) G2476 (PerfActPtc) at G1909 Caesar’s G2541 judgment seat G0968, where G3757 I G3165 ought G1163 (PresInd) to be judged G2919 (PresPasInf): to the Jews G2453 have I done G0091 no G3762 wrong G0091 (AorActInd), as G5613 G2532 thou G4771 very well G2566 knowest G1921 (PresActInd).
025:011 For G1063 if G1487 G3303 I be an offender G0091 (PresActInd), or G2532 have committed G4238 (PerfActInd) any thing G5100 worthy G0514 of death G2288, I refuse G3868 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 to die G0599 (Aor2ActInf): but G1161 if G1487 there be G2076 (PresInd) none G3762 of these things G3739 whereof these G3778 accuse G2723 (PresActInd) me G3450, no man G3762 may G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) deliver G5483 (AorMidDepInf) me G3165 unto them G0846. I appeal unto G1941 (PresMidInd) Caesar G2541.
025:012 Then G5119 Festus G5347, when he had conferred G4814 (AorActPtc) with G3326 the council G4824, answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), Hast thou appealed unto G1941 (PerfMidInd) Caesar G2541? unto G1909 Caesar G2541 shalt thou go G4198 (FutMidDepInd).
025:013 And G1161 after G1230 (Aor2MidDepPtc) certain G5100 days G2250 king G0935 Agrippa G0067 and G2532 Bernice G0959 came G2658 (AorActInd) unto G1519 Caesarea G2542 to salute G0782 (FutMidDepPtc) Festus G5347.
025:014 And G1161 when G5613 they had been G1304 (ImpfActInd) there G1563 many G4119 days G2250, Festus G5347 declared G0394 (Aor2MidInd) Paul’s G3972 cause G2596 unto the king G0935, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), There is G2076 (PresInd) a certain G5100 man G0435 left G2641 (PerfPasPtc) in bonds G1198 by G5259 Felix G5344:
025:015 About G4012 whom G3739, when G1096 I G3450 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) at G1519 Jerusalem G2414, the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the elders G4245 of the Jews G2453 informed G1718 (AorActInd) [me], desiring G0154 (PresMidPtc) [to have] judgment G1349 against G2596 him G0846.
025:016 To G4314 whom G3739 I answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), G3754 It is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 the manner G1485 of the Romans G4514 to deliver G5483 (PresMidPasDepInf) any G5100 man G0444 to G1519 die G0684, before G4250 that G2228 he which is accused G2723 (PresPasPtc) have G2192 (PresActOpt) the accusers G2725 face to face G2596 G4383, G5037 and have G2983 (Aor2ActOpt) licence G5117 to answer for himself G0627 concerning G4012 the crime laid against him G1462.
025:017 Therefore G3767, when they G0846 were come G4905 (Aor2ActPtc) hither G1759, without G4160 (AorMidPtc) any G3367 delay G0311 on the morrow G1836 I sat G2523 (AorActPtc) on G1909 the judgment seat G0968, and commanded G2753 (AorActInd) the man G0435 to be brought forth G0071 (AorPasInf).
025:018 Against G4012 whom G3739 when the accusers G2725 stood up G2476 (AorPasPtc), they brought G2018 (ImpfActInd) none G3762 accusation G0156 of such things as G3739 I G1473 supposed G5282 (ImpfActInd):
025:019 But G1161 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) certain G5100 questions G2213 against G4314 him G0846 of G4012 their own G2398 superstition G1175, and G2532 of G4012 one G5100 Jesus G2424, which was dead G2348 (PerfActPtc), whom G3739 Paul G3972 affirmed G5335 (ImpfActInd) to be alive G2198 (PresActInf).
025:020 And G1161 because I G1473 doubted G0639 (PresMidPtc) of G1519 such G5127 manner G4012 of questions G2214, I asked G3004 (ImpfActInd) [him] whether G1487 he would G1014 (PresMidPasDepOpt) go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, and there G2546 be judged G2919 (PresPasInf) of G4012 these matters G5130.
025:021 But G1161 when Paul G3972 had appealed G1941 (AorMidPtc) to be reserved G5083 (AorPasInf) G0846 unto G1519 the hearing G1233 of Augustus G4575, I commanded G2753 (AorActInd) him G0846 to be kept G5083 (PresPasInf) till G2193 G3739 I might send G3992 (AorActSubj) him G0846 to G4314 Caesar G2541.
025:022 Then G1161 Agrippa G0067 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto G4314 Festus G5347, I would G1014 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) also G2532 hear G0191 (AorActInf) the man G0444 myself G0846. To morrow G0839, G1161 said G5346 (PresInd) he, thou shalt hear G0191 (FutMidDepInd) him G0846.
025:023 And on the morrow G1887, when G3767 Agrippa G0067 was come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 Bernice G0959, with G3326 great G4183 pomp G5325, and G2532 was entered G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the place of hearing G0201, with G4862 G5037 the chief captains G5506, and G2532 principal G2596 G1851 men G0435 of G5607 (PresPtc) the city G4172, at G2532 Festus G5347 ’ commandment G2753 (AorActPtc) Paul G3972 was brought forth G0071 (AorPasInd).
025:024 And G2532 Festus G5347 said G5346 (PresInd), King G0935 Agrippa G0067, and G2532 all G3956 men G0435 which G3588 are here present G4840 (PresPtc) with us G2254, ye see G2334 (PresActInd) this man G5126, about G4012 whom G3739 all G3956 the multitude G4128 of the Jews G2453 have dealt G1793 (Aor2ActInd) with me G3427, both G5037 at G1722 Jerusalem G2414, and G2532 [also] here G1759, crying G1916 (PresActPtc) that he ought G1163 (PresInf) not G3361 to live G2198 (PresActInf) any longer G3371.
025:025 But G1161 when I G1473 found G2638 (Aor2MidPtc) that he G0846 had committed G4238 (PerfActInf) nothing G3367 worthy G0514 of death G2288, and G2532 G1161 that he himself G0846 hath appealed G5127 to G1941 (AorMidPtc) Augustus G4575, I have determined G2919 (AorActInd) to send G3992 (PresActInf) him G0846.
025:026 Of G4012 whom G3739 I have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 certain G0804 thing G5100 to write G1125 (AorActInf) unto my lord G2962. Wherefore G1352 I have brought G4254 him G0846 forth G4254 (Aor2ActInd) before G1909 you G5216, and G2532 specially G3122 before G1909 thee G4675, O king G0935 Agrippa G0067, that G3704, after examination G0351 had G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), I might have G2192 (Aor2ActSubj) somewhat G5100 to write G1125 (AorActInf).
025:027 For G1063 it seemeth G1380 (PresActInd) to me G3427 unreasonable G0249 to send G3992 (PresActPtc) a prisoner G1198, and G2532 not withal G3361 to signify G4591 (AorActInf) the crimes G0156 [laid] against G2596 him G0846.
026:001 ¶  Then G1161 Agrippa G0067 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto G4314 Paul G3972, Thou G4671 art permitted G2010 (PresPasInd) to speak G3004 (PresActInf) for G5228 thyself G4572. Then G5119 Paul G3972 stretched forth G1614 (AorActPtc) the hand G5495, and answered for himself G0626 (ImpfMidPasDepInd):
026:002 I think G2233 (PerfMidPasDepInd) myself G1683 happy G3107, king G0935 Agrippa G0067, because I shall G3195 (PresActPtc) answer for myself G0626 (PresMidPasDepInf) this day G4594 before G1909 thee G4675 touching G4012 all the things G3956 whereof G3739 I am accused G1458 (PresPasInd) of G5259 the Jews G2453:
026:003 Especially G3122 [because I know G1492 (PerfActPtc) ] thee G4571 to be G5607 (PresPtc) expert G1109 G5037 in all G3956 customs G1485 and G2532 questions G2213 which are among G2596 the Jews G2453: wherefore G1352 I beseech G1189 (PresMidPasDepInd) thee G4675 to hear G0191 (AorActInf) me G3450 patiently G3116.
026:004 My G3450 manner G3303 G3767 of life G0981 from G1537 my youth G3503, which G3588 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) at G0575 the first G0746 among G1722 mine G3450 own nation G1484 at G1722 Jerusalem G2414, know G2467 (PerfActInd) all G3956 the Jews G2453;
026:005 Which knew G4267 (PresActPtc) me G3165 from the beginning G0509, if G1437 they would G2309 (PresActSubj) testify G3140 (PresActInf), that G3754 after G2596 the most straitest G0196 sect G0139 of our G2251 religion G2356 I lived G2198 (AorActInd) a Pharisee G5330.
026:006 And G2532 now G3568 I stand G2476 (PerfActInd) and am judged G2919 (PresPasPtc) for G1909 the hope G1680 of the promise G1860 made G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) of G5259 God G2316 unto G4314 our fathers G3962:
026:007 Unto G1519 which G3739 [promise] our G2257 twelve tribes G1429, instantly G1722 G1616 serving G3000 (PresActPtc) [God] day G2250 and G2532 night G3571, hope G1679 (PresActInd) to come G2658 (AorActInf). For G4012 which G3739 hope’s sake G1680, king G0935 Agrippa G0067, I am accused G1458 (PresPasInd) of G5259 the Jews G2453.
026:008 Why G5101 should it be thought a thing G2919 (PresPasInd) incredible G0571 with G3844 you G5213, that G1487 God G2316 should raise G1453 (PresActInd) the dead G3498?
026:009 I G1473 verily G3303 G3767 thought G1380 (AorActInd) with myself G1683, that I ought G1163 (PresInf) to do G4238 (AorActInf) many things G4183 contrary G1727 to G4314 the name G3686 of Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480.
026:010 Which thing G3739 I G4160 also G2532 did G4160 (AorActInd) in G1722 Jerusalem G2414: and G2532 many G4183 of the saints G0040 did G2623 I G1473 shut up G2623 (AorActInd) in prison G5438, having received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) authority G1849 from G3844 the chief priests G0749; and G5037 when they G0846 were put to death G0337 (PresPasPtc), I gave G2702 (AorActInd) my voice G5586 against [them].
026:011 And G2532 I punished G5097 (PresActPtc) them G0846 oft G4178 in G2596 every G3956 synagogue G4864, and compelled G0315 (ImpfActInd) [them] to blaspheme G0987 (PresActInf); and G5037 being G1693 exceedingly G4057 mad against G1693 (PresMidPasDepPtc) them G0846, I persecuted G1377 (ImpfActInd) [them] even G2532 unto G1519 G2193 strange G1854 cities G4172.
026:012 G2532 Whereupon G1722 G3739 as I went G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G1519 Damascus G1154 with G3326 authority G1849 and G2532 commission G2011 from G3844 the chief priests G0749,
026:013 At midday G2250 G3319, O king G0935, I saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) in G2596 the way G3598 a light G5457 from heaven G3771, above G5228 the brightness G2987 of the sun G2246, shining round about G4034 (AorActPtc) me G3165 and G2532 them which journeyed G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with G4862 me G1698.
026:014 And G1161 when we G2257 were G2667 all G3956 fallen G2667 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 the earth G1093, I heard G0191 (AorActInd) a voice G5456 speaking G2980 (PresActPtc) unto G4314 me G3165, and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) in the Hebrew G1446 tongue G1258, Saul G4549, Saul G4549, why G5101 persecutest thou G1377 (PresActInd) me G3165? [it is] hard G4642 for thee G4671 to kick G2979 (PresActInf) against G4314 the pricks G2759.
026:015 And G1161 I G1473 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Who G5101 art thou G1488 (PresInd), Lord G2962? And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) Jesus G2424 whom G3739 thou G4771 persecutest G1377 (PresActInd).
026:016 But G0235 rise G0450 (Aor2ActImpr), and G2532 stand G2476 (Aor2ActImpr) upon G1909 thy G4675 feet G4228: for G1063 I have appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) unto thee G4671 for G1519 this purpose G5124, to make G4400 (AorMidDepInf) thee G4571 a minister G5257 and G2532 a witness G3144 both G5037 of these things which G3739 thou hast seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd), and G5037 of those things in the which G3739 I will appear G3700 (FutPasInd) unto thee G4671;
026:017 Delivering G1807 (PresMidPtc) thee G4571 from G1537 the people G2992, and G2532 [from] the Gentiles G1484, unto G1519 whom G3739 now G3568 I send G0649 (PresActInd) thee G4571,
026:018 To open G0455 (AorActInf) their G0846 eyes G3788, [and] to turn G1994 (AorActInf) [them] from G0575 darkness G4655 to G1519 light G5457, and G2532 [from] the power G1849 of Satan G4567 unto G1909 God G2316, that they G0846 may receive G2983 (Aor2ActInf) forgiveness G0859 of sins G0266, and G2532 inheritance G2819 among G1722 them which are sanctified G0037 (PerfPasPtc) by faith G4102 that is in G1519 me G1691.
026:019 Whereupon G3606, O king G0935 Agrippa G0067, I was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) not G3756 disobedient G0545 unto the heavenly G3770 vision G3701:
026:020 But G0235 shewed G0518 (PresActPtc) G0518 (ImpfActInd) first G4412 unto them of G1722 Damascus G1154, and G2532 at Jerusalem G2414, and G5037 throughout G1519 all G3956 the coasts G5561 of Judaea G2449, and G2532 [then] to the Gentiles G1484, that they should repent G3340 (PresActInf) and G2532 turn G1994 (PresActInf) to G1909 God G2316, and do G4238 (PresActPtc) works G2041 meet G0514 for repentance G3341.
026:021 For G1752 these causes G5130 the Jews G2453 caught G4815 (Aor2MidPtc) me G3165 in G1722 the temple G2411, and went about G3987 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to kill G1315 (AorMidInf) [me].
026:022 Having G5177 therefore G3767 obtained G5177 (Aor2ActPtc) help G1947 of G3844 God G2316, I continue G2476 (PerfActInd) unto G0891 this G5026 day G2250, witnessing G3140 (PresPasPtc) both G5037 to small G3398 and G2532 great G3173, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) none other things G3762 than G1622 those which G3739 G5037 the prophets G4396 and G2532 Moses G3475 did say G2980 (AorActInd) should G3195 (PresActPtc) come G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf):
026:023 That G1487 Christ G5547 should suffer G3805, [and] that G1487 he should be the first G4413 that should rise G0386 from G1537 the dead G3498, and should G3195 (PresActInd) shew G2605 (PresActInf) light G5457 unto the people G2992, and G2532 to the Gentiles G1484.
026:024 And G1161 as he G0846 thus G5023 spake for himself G0626 (PresMidPasDepPtc), Festus G5347 said G5346 (ImpfInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, Paul G3972, thou art beside thyself G3105 (PresMidPasDepInd); much G4183 learning G1121 doth make G4062 (PresActInd) thee G4571 mad G1519 G3130.
026:025 But G1161 he said G5346 (PresInd), I am G3105 not G3756 mad G3105 (PresMidPasDepInd), most noble G2903 Festus G5347; but G0235 speak forth G0669 (PresMidPasDepInd) the words G4487 of truth G0225 and G2532 soberness G4997.
026:026 For G1063 the king G0935 knoweth G1987 (PresMidPasDepInd) of G4012 these G5130 things, before G4314 whom G3739 also G2532 I speak G2980 (PresActInd) freely G3955 (PresMidPasDepPtc): for G1063 I am persuaded G3982 (PresPasInd) that G3756 none G5100 G3762 of these things G5130 are hidden G2990 (PresActInf) from him G0846; for G1063 this thing G5124 was G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 done G4238 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 a corner G1137.
026:027 King G0935 Agrippa G0067, believest thou G4100 (PresActInd) the prophets G4396? I know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 thou believest G4100 (PresActInd).
026:028 Then G1161 Agrippa G0067 said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto G4314 Paul G3972, Almost G1722 G3641 thou persuadest G3982 (PresActInd) me G3165 to be G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) a Christian G5546.
026:029 And G1161 Paul G3972 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I would G0302 G2172 (AorMidDepOpt) to God G2316, that not G3756 only G3440 thou G4571, but G0235 also G2532 all G3956 that hear G0191 (PresActPtc) me G3450 this day G4594, were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) both G2532 almost G1722 G3641, and G2532 altogether G1722 G4183 such G5108 as G3697 G2504 I am G1510 (PresInd), except G3924 these G5130 bonds G1199.
026:030 And G2532 when he G0846 had G2036 thus G5023 spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), the king G0935 rose up G0450 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the governor G2232, and G5037 Bernice G0959, and G2532 they that sat with G4775 (PresMidPasDepPtc) them G0846:
026:031 And G2532 when they were gone aside G0402 (AorActPtc), they talked G2980 (ImpfActInd) between G4314 themselves G0240, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 This G3778 man G0444 doeth G4238 (PresActInd) nothing G3762 worthy G0514 of death G2288 or G2228 of bonds G1199.
026:032 Then G1161 said G5346 (ImpfInd) Agrippa G0067 unto Festus G5347, This G3778 man G0444 might G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) have been set at liberty G0630 (PerfPasInf), if G1508 he had G1941 not G1508 appealed unto G1941 (PlupfMidDepInd) Caesar G2541.
027:001 ¶  And G1161 when G5613 it was determined G2919 (AorPasInd) that we G2248 should sail G0636 (PresActInf) into G1519 Italy G2482, they delivered G3860 (ImpfActInd) G5037 Paul G3972 and G2532 certain G5100 other G2087 prisoners G1202 unto [one] named G3686 Julius G2457, a centurion G1543 of Augustus G4575 ’ band G4686.
027:002 And G1161 entering G1910 (Aor2ActPtc) into a ship G4143 of Adramyttium G0098, we launched G0321 (AorPasInd), meaning G3195 (PresActPtc) to sail G4126 (PresActInf) by G2596 the coasts G5117 of Asia G0773; [one] Aristarchus G0708, a Macedonian G3110 of Thessalonica G2331, being G5607 (PresPtc) with G4862 us G2254.
027:003 And G5037 the next G2087 [day] we touched G2609 (Aor2PasDepSubj) at G1519 Sidon G4605. And G5037 Julius G2457 courteously G5364 entreated G5530 (AorMidDepPtc) Paul G3972, and gave [him] liberty G2010 (AorActInd) to go G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) unto G4314 his friends G5384 to refresh himself G5177 (Aor2ActInf) G1958.
027:004 And G2547 when we had launched G0321 (AorPasPtc) from thence G2547, we sailed under G5284 (AorActInd) Cyprus G2954, because G1223 the winds G0417 were G1511 (PresInf) contrary G1727.
027:005 And G5037 when we had sailed over G1277 (AorActPtc) the sea G3989 of G2596 Cilicia G2791 and G2532 Pamphylia G3828, we came G2718 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Myra G3460, [a city] of Lycia G3073.
027:006 And there G2546 the centurion G1543 found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) a ship G4143 of Alexandria G0222 sailing G4126 (PresActPtc) into G1519 Italy G2482; and he put G1688 (AorActInd) us G2248 therein G1519 G0846.
027:007 And G1161 when we had sailed slowly G1020 (PresActPtc) G1722 many G2425 days G2250, and G2532 scarce G3433 were come G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) over against G2596 Cnidus G2834, the wind G0417 not G3361 suffering G4330 (PresActPtc) us G2248, we sailed under G5284 (AorActInd) Crete G2914, over against G2596 Salmone G4534;
027:008 And G5037, hardly G3433 passing G3881 (PresMidPasDepPtc) it G0846, came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1519 a G5100 place G5117 which is called G2564 (PresPasPtc) The fair G2570 havens G2568 G3040; nigh G1451 whereunto G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the city G4172 [of] Lasea G2996.
027:009 Now G1161 when much G2425 time G5550 was spent G1230 (Aor2MidDepPtc), and G2532 when sailing G4144 was G5607 (PresPtc) now G2235 dangerous G2000, because G1223 the fast G3521 was G3928 now G2532 already G2235 past G3928 (Perf2ActInf), Paul G3972 admonished G3867 (ImpfActInd) [them],
027:010 And said G3004 (PresActPtc) unto them G0846, Sirs G0435, I perceive G2334 (PresActInd) that G3754 this voyage G4144 will be G3195 (PresActInf) G1510 (FutInf) with G3326 hurt G5196 and G2532 much G4183 damage G2209, not G3756 only G3440 of the lading G5414 and G2532 ship G4143, but G0235 also G2532 of our G2257 lives G5590.
027:011 Nevertheless G1161 the centurion G1543 believed G3982 (ImpfPasInd) the master G2942 and G2532 the owner of the ship G3490, more G3123 than G2228 those things which were spoken G3004 (PresPasPtc) by G5259 Paul G3972.
027:012 And G1161 because G5225 the haven G3040 was G5225 (PresActPtc) not commodious G0428 to G4314 winter in G3915, the more part G4119 advised G1012 G5087 (Aor2MidInd) to depart G0321 (AorPasInf) thence also G2547, if G1513 by any means G4458 they might G1410 (PresMidPasDepOpt) attain G2658 (AorActPtc) to G1519 Phenice G5405, [and there] to winter G3914 (AorActInf); [which is] an haven G3040 of Crete G2914, and lieth G0991 (PresActPtc) toward G2596 the south west G3047 and G2532 G2596 north west G5566.
027:013 And G1161 when the south wind G3558 blew softly G5285 (AorActPtc), supposing G1380 (AorActPtc) that they had obtained G2902 (PerfActInf) [their] purpose G4286, loosing G0142 (AorActPtc) [thence], they sailed G3881 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) close by G0788 Crete G2914.
027:014 But G1161 not G3756 long G4183 after G3326 there arose G0906 (Aor2ActInd) against G2596 it G0846 a tempestuous G5189 wind G0417, called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Euroclydon G2148.
027:015 And G1161 when the ship G4143 was caught G4884 (AorPasPtc), and G2532 could G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) not G3361 bear up into G0503 (PresActInf) the wind G0417, we let [her] drive G1929 (Aor2ActPtc) G5342 (ImpfPasInd).
027:016 And G1161 running under G5295 (Aor2ActPtc) a certain G5100 island G3519 which is called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Clauda G2802, we had G2480 much G3433 work G2480 (AorActInd) to come by G4031 G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) the boat G4627:
027:017 Which G3739 when they had taken up G0142 (AorActPtc), they used G5530 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) helps G0996, undergirding G5269 (PresActPtc) the ship G4143; and G5037, fearing G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) lest G3361 they should fall G1601 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 the quicksands G4950, strake G5465 (AorActPtc) sail G4632, and so G3779 were driven G5342 (ImpfPasInd).
027:018 And G1161 we G2257 being exceedingly G4971 tossed with a tempest G5492 (PresPasPtc), the next G1836 [day] they lightened the ship G1546 G4160 (ImpfMidInd);
027:019 And G2532 the third G5154 [day] we cast out G4496 (AorActInd) with our own hands G0849 the tackling G4631 of the ship G4143.
027:020 And G1161 when neither G3383 sun G2246 nor G3383 stars G0798 in G1909 many G4119 days G2250 appeared G2014 (PresActPtc), and G5037 no G3756 small G3641 tempest G5494 lay on G1945 (PresMidPasDepPtc) [us], all G3956 hope G1680 that we G2248 should be saved G4982 (PresPasInf) was G4014 then G3063 taken away G4014 (ImpfPasInd).
027:021 But G1161 after G5225 (PresActPtc) long G4183 abstinence G0776 G5119 Paul G3972 stood forth G2476 (AorPasPtc) in G1722 the midst G3319 of them G0846, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Sirs G5599 G0435, ye should G1163 (ImpfInd) G3303 have hearkened G3980 (AorActPtc) unto me G3427, and not G3361 have loosed G0321 (PresPasInf) from G0575 Crete G2914, and G5037 to have gained G2770 (AorActInf) this G5026 harm G5196 and G2532 loss G2209.
027:022 And G2532 now G3569 I exhort G3867 (PresActInd) you G5209 to be of good cheer G2114 (PresActInf): for G1063 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) no G3762 loss G0580 of [any man’s] life G5590 among G1537 you G5216, but G4133 of the ship G4143.
027:023 For G1063 there stood by G3936 (Aor2ActInd) me G3427 this G5026 night G3571 the angel G0032 of God G2316, whose G3739 I am G1510 (PresInd), and G2532 whom G3739 I serve G3000 (PresActInd),
027:024 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361, Paul G3972; thou G4571 must G1163 (PresInd) be brought before G3936 (Aor2ActInf) Caesar G2541: and G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), God G2316 hath given G5483 (PerfMidPasDepInd) thee G4671 all G3956 them that sail G4126 (PresActPtc) with G3326 thee G4675.
027:025 Wherefore G1352, sirs G0435, be of good cheer G2114 (PresActImpr): for G1063 I believe G4100 (PresActInd) God G2316, that G3754 it G3779 shall be G2071 (FutInd) even G2596 G3739 as G5158 it was told G2980 (PerfPasInd) me G3427.
027:026 Howbeit G1161 we G2248 must G1163 (PresInd) be cast G1601 (Aor2ActInf) upon G1519 a certain G5100 island G3520.
027:027 But G1161 when G5613 the fourteenth G5065 night G3571 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as we G2257 were driven up and down G1308 (PresPasPtc) in G1722 Adria G0099, about G2596 midnight G3319 G3571 the shipmen G3492 deemed G5282 (ImpfActInd) that they G0846 drew near G4317 (PresActInf) to some G5100 country G5561;
027:028 And G2532 sounded G1001 (AorActPtc), and found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) [it] twenty G1501 fathoms G3712: and G1161 when they had gone G1339 (AorActPtc) a little further G1024, they sounded G1001 (AorActPtc) again G3825, and G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) [it] fifteen G1178 fathoms G3712.
027:029 Then G5037 fearing G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) lest G3381 G4458 we should have fallen G1601 (Aor2ActSubj) G1601 (Aor2ActSubj) upon G1519 rocks G5117 G5138, they cast G4496 (AorActPtc) four G5064 anchors G0045 out of G1537 the stern G4403, and wished G2172 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) for the day G2250.
027:030 And G1161 as the shipmen G3492 were about G2212 (PresActPtc) to flee G5343 (Aor2ActInf) out of G1537 the ship G4143, when G2532 they had let down G5465 (AorActPtc) the boat G4627 into G1519 the sea G2281, under colour G4392 as though G5613 they would G3195 (PresActPtc) have cast G1614 (PresActInf) anchors G0045 out of G1537 the foreship G4408,
027:031 Paul G3972 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to the centurion G1543 and G2532 to the soldiers G4757, Except G3362 these G3778 abide G3306 (AorActSubj) in G1722 the ship G4143, ye G5210 cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be saved G4982 (AorPasInf).
027:032 Then G5119 the soldiers G4757 cut off G0609 (AorActInd) the ropes G4979 of the boat G4627, and G2532 let G1439 (AorActInd) her G0846 fall off G1601 (Aor2ActInf).
027:033 And G1161 while G0891 G3739 the day G2250 was coming G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf) on G3195 (ImpfActInd), Paul G3972 besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) [them] all G0537 to take G3335 (Aor2ActInf) meat G5160, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This day G4594 is the fourteenth G5065 day G2250 that ye have tarried G4328 (PresActPtc) and continued G1300 (PresActInd) fasting G0777, having taken G4355 (Aor2MidPtc) nothing G3367.
027:034 Wherefore G1352 I pray G3870 (PresActInd) you G5209 to take G4355 (Aor2ActInf) [some] meat G5160: for G1063 this G5124 is G5225 (PresActInd) for G4314 your G5212 health G4991: for G1063 there shall G4098 not G3762 an hair G2359 fall G4098 (FutMidDepInd) from G1537 the head G2776 of any G3762 of you G5216.
027:035 And G1161 when he had thus G5023 spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), G2532 he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) bread G0740, and gave thanks G2168 (AorActInd) to God G2316 in presence G1799 of them all G3956: and G2532 when he had broken G2806 (AorActPtc) [it], he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to eat G2068 (PresActInf).
027:036 Then G1161 were G1096 they G0846 G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) all G3956 of good cheer G2115, and they G4355 also G2532 took G4355 (Aor2MidInd) [some] meat G5160.
027:037 And G1161 we were G2258 (ImpfInd) in all G3956 in G1722 the ship G4143 two hundred G1250 threescore G1440 and sixteen G1803 souls G5590.
027:038 And G1161 when they had eaten G5160 enough G2880 (AorPasPtc), they lightened G2893 (ImpfActInd) the ship G4143, and cast out G1544 (PresMidPtc) the wheat G4621 into G1519 the sea G2281.
027:039 And G1161 when G3753 it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) day G2250, they knew G1921 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 the land G1093: but G1161 they discovered G2657 (ImpfActInd) a certain G5100 creek G2859 with G2192 (PresActPtc) a shore G0123, into G1519 the which G3739 they were minded G1011 (AorMidDepInd), if G1487 it were possible G1410 (PresMidPasDepOpt), to thrust in G1856 (AorActInf) the ship G4143.
027:040 And G2532 when they had taken up G4014 (Aor2ActPtc) the anchors G0045, they committed G1439 (ImpfActInd) [themselves] unto G1519 the sea G2281, and G0260 loosed G0447 (Aor2ActPtc) the rudder G4079 bands G2202, and G2532 hoised up G1869 (AorActPtc) the mainsail G0736 to the wind G4154 (PresActPtc), and made G2722 (ImpfActInd) toward G1519 shore G0123.
027:041 And G1161 falling G4045 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 a place G5117 where two seas met G1337, they ran G2027 the ship G3491 aground G2027 (AorActInd); and G2532 the forepart G4408 G3303 stuck fast G2043 (AorActPtc), and remained G3306 (AorActInd) unmoveable G0761, but G1161 the hinder part G4403 was broken G3089 (ImpfPasInd) with G5259 the violence G0970 of the waves G2949.
027:042 And G1161 the soldiers G4757 ’ counsel G1012 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) to G2443 kill G0615 (PresActSubj) the prisoners G1202, lest G3361 any of them G5100 should swim out G1579 (AorActPtc), and escape G1309 (Aor2ActOpt).
027:043 But G1161 the centurion G1543, willing G1014 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to save G1295 (AorActInf) Paul G3972, kept G2967 (AorActInd) them G0846 from [their] purpose G1013; and G5037 commanded G2753 (AorActInd) that they which could G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) swim G2860 (PresActInf) should cast G0641 (AorActPtc) [themselves] first G4413 [into the sea], and get G1826 (PresInf) to G1909 land G1093:
027:044 And G2532 the rest G3062, some G3739 G3303 on G1909 boards G4548, and G1161 some G3739 on G1909 [broken pieces] of G0575 the ship G4143 G5100. And G2532 so G3779 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that they escaped G1295 all G3956 safe G1295 (AorPasInf) to G1909 land G1093.
028:001 ¶  And G2532 when they were escaped G1295 (AorPasPtc), then G5119 they knew G1921 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 the island G3520 was called G2564 (PresPasInd) Melita G3194.
028:002 And G1161 the barbarous people G0915 shewed G3930 (ImpfActInd) us G2254 no G3756 little G5177 (Aor2ActPtc) kindness G5363: for G1063 they kindled G0381 (AorActPtc) a fire G4443, and received G4355 (Aor2MidInd) us G2248 every one G3956, because G1223 of the present G2186 (PerfActPtc) rain G5205, and G2532 because G1223 of the cold G5592.
028:003 And G1161 when Paul G3972 had gathered G4962 (AorActPtc) a bundle G4128 of sticks G5434, and G2532 laid G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) [them] on G1909 the fire G4443, there came G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) a viper G2191 out of G1537 the heat G2329, and fastened on G2510 (AorActInd) his G0846 hand G5495.
028:004 And G1161 when G5613 the barbarians G0915 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the [venomous] beast G2342 hang G2910 (PresMidPtc) on G1537 his G0846 hand G5495, they said G3004 (ImpfActInd) among G4314 themselves G0240, No doubt G3843 this G3778 man G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) a murderer G5406, whom G3739, though he hath escaped G1295 (AorPasPtc) G1537 the sea G2281, yet vengeance G1349 suffereth G1439 (AorActInd) not G3756 to live G2198 (PresActInf).
028:005 And G3303 G3767 he shook off G0660 (AorActPtc) the beast G2342 into G1519 the fire G4442, and felt G3958 (Aor2ActInd) no G3762 harm G2556.
028:006 Howbeit G1161 they looked G4328 (ImpfActInd) when he G0846 should G3195 (PresActInf) have swollen G4092 (PresPasInf), or G2228 fallen down G2667 (PresActInf) dead G3498 suddenly G0869: but G1161 after they G0846 had looked G4328 (PresActPtc) a great while G1909 G4183, and G2532 saw G2334 (PresActPtc) no G3367 harm G0824 come G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G1519 him G0846, they changed their minds G3328 (PresMidPtc), and said G3004 (ImpfActInd) that he G0846 was G1511 (PresInf) a god G2316.
028:007 G1161 In G1722 G4012 the same G1565 quarters G5117 were G5225 (ImpfActInd) possessions G5564 of the chief man G4413 of the island G3520, whose name was G3686 Publius G4196; who G3739 received G0324 (AorMidDepPtc) us G2248, and lodged us G3579 (AorActInd) three G5140 days G2250 courteously G5390.
028:008 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that the father G3962 of Publius G4196 lay G2621 (PresMidPasDepInf) sick of G4912 (PresPasPtc) a fever G4446 and G2532 of a bloody flux G1420: to G4314 whom G3739 Paul G3972 entered in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc), and G2532 prayed G4336 (AorMidDepPtc), and laid G2007 his hands G5495 on G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and healed G2390 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846.
028:009 So G3767 when G1096 this G5127 was done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), others G3062 also G2532, which G3588 had G2192 (PresActPtc) diseases G0769 in G1722 the island G3520, came G4334 (ImpfMidPasDepInd), and G2532 were healed G2323 (ImpfPasInd):
028:010 Who G3739 also G2532 honoured G5092 us G2248 with many G4183 honours G5091 (AorActInd); and G2532 when we departed G0321 (PresPasPtc), they laded G2007 (Aor2MidInd) [us] with such things as G4314 were necessary G5532.
028:011 And G1161 after G3326 three G5140 months G3376 we departed G0321 (AorPasInd) in G1722 a ship G4143 of Alexandria G0222, which had wintered G3914 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 the isle G3520, whose sign G3902 was Castor and Pollux G1359.
028:012 And G2532 landing G2609 (AorPasPtc) at G1519 Syracuse G4946, we tarried G1961 (AorActInd) [there] three G5140 days G2250.
028:013 And from thence G3606 we fetched a compass G4022 (Aor2ActPtc), and came G2658 (AorActInd) to G1519 Rhegium G4484: and G2532 after G3326 one G3391 day G2250 the south wind G3558 blew G1920 (Aor2MidDepPtc), and we came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) the next day G1206 to G1519 Puteoli G4223:
028:014 Where G3757 we found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) brethren G0080, and were desired G3870 (AorPasInd) to tarry G1961 (AorActInf) with G1909 them G0846 seven G2033 days G2250: and G2532 so G3779 we went G2064 (Aor2ActInd) toward G1519 Rome G4516.
028:015 And from thence G2547, when the brethren G0080 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) of G4012 us G2257, they came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) to meet G0529 G1519 us G2254 as far as G0891 Appii G0675 forum G5410, and G2532 The three G5140 taverns G4999: whom G3739 when Paul G3972 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc), he thanked G2168 (AorActPtc) God G2316, and took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) courage G2294.
028:016 And G1161 when G3753 we came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Rome G4516, the centurion G1543 delivered G3860 (AorActInd) the prisoners G1198 to the captain of the guard G4759: but G1161 Paul G3972 was suffered G2010 (AorPasInd) to dwell G3306 (PresActInf) by G2596 himself G1438 with G4862 a soldier G4757 that kept G5442 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
028:017 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that after G3326 three G5140 days G2250 Paul G3972 called G4779 the chief G4413 G5607 (PresPtc) of the Jews G2453 together G4779 (AorMidInf): and G1161 when they G0846 were come together G4905 (Aor2ActPtc), he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Men G0435 [and] brethren G0080, though I G1473 have committed G4160 (AorActPtc) nothing G3762 against G1727 the people G2992, or G2228 customs G1485 of our fathers G3971, yet was I delivered G3860 (AorPasInd) prisoner G1198 from G1537 Jerusalem G2414 into G1519 the hands G5495 of the Romans G4514.
028:018 Who G3748, when they had examined G0350 (AorActPtc) me G3165, would G1014 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) have let [me] go G0630 (AorActInf), because G1223 there was G5225 (PresActInf) no G3367 cause G0156 of death G2288 in G1722 me G1698.
028:019 But G1161 when the Jews G2453 spake against G0483 (PresActPtc) [it], I was constrained G0315 (AorPasInd) to appeal G1941 (AorMidInf) unto Caesar G2541; not G3756 that G5613 I had G2192 (PresActPtc) ought G5100 to accuse G2723 my G3450 nation G1484 of G2723 (AorActInf).
028:020 For G1223 this G5026 cause G0156 therefore G3767 have I called G3870 (AorActInd) for you G5209, to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) [you], and G2532 to speak with G4354 (AorActInf) [you]: because that G1752 for G1063 the hope G1680 of Israel G2474 I am bound with G4029 (PresMidPasDepInd) this G5026 chain G0254.
028:021 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, We G2249 neither G3777 received G1209 (AorMidDepInd) letters G1121 out of G0575 Judaea G2449 concerning G4012 thee G4675, neither G3777 any G5100 of the brethren G0080 that came G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) shewed G0518 (AorActInd) or G2228 spake G2980 (AorActInd) any G5100 harm G4190 of G4012 thee G4675.
028:022 But G1161 we desire G0515 (PresActInd) to hear G0191 (AorActInf) of G3844 thee G4675 what G3739 thou thinkest G5426 (PresActInd): for G1063 as concerning G4012 G3303 this G5026 sect G0139, we G2254 know G2076 (PresInd) G1110 that G3754 every where G3837 it is spoken against G0483 (PresPasInd).
028:023 And G1161 when they had appointed G5021 (AorMidPtc) him G0846 a day G2250, there came G2240 (ImpfActInd) many G4119 to G4314 him G0846 into G1519 [his] lodging G3578; to whom G3739 he expounded G1620 (ImpfMidInd) and testified G1263 (PresMidPasDepPtc) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, G5037 persuading G3982 (PresActPtc) them G0846 concerning G4012 Jesus G2424, both G5037 out of G0575 the law G3551 of Moses G3475, and G2532 [out of] the prophets G4396, from G0575 morning G4404 till G2193 evening G2073.
028:024 And G2532 some G3303 believed G3982 (ImpfPasInd) the things which were spoken G3004 (PresPasPtc), and G1161 some believed not G0569 (ImpfActInd).
028:025 And G1161 when they agreed not G0800 G5607 (PresPtc) among G4314 themselves G0240, they departed G0630 (ImpfMidInd), after that Paul G3972 had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) one G1520 word G4487, G3754 Well G2573 spake G2980 (AorActInd) the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 by G1223 Esaias G2268 the prophet G4396 unto G4314 our G2257 fathers G3962,
028:026 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Go G4198 (AorPasDepImpr) unto G4314 this G5126 people G2992, and G2532 say G2036 (Aor2ActImpr), Hearing G0189 ye shall hear G0191 (FutActInd), and G2532 shall G4920 not G3364 understand G4920 (Aor2Subj); and G2532 seeing G0991 (PresActPtc) ye shall see G0991 (FutActInd), and G2532 not G3364 perceive G1492 (Aor2ActSubj):
028:027 For G1063 the heart G2588 of this G5127 people G2992 is waxed gross G3975 (AorPasInd), and G2532 their ears G3775 are dull G0917 of hearing G0191 (AorActInd), and G2532 their G0846 eyes G3788 have they closed G2576 (AorActInd); lest G3379 they should see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) with [their] eyes G3788, and G2532 hear G0191 (AorActSubj) with [their] ears G3775, and G2532 understand G4920 (Aor2ActSubj) with [their] heart G2588, and G2532 should be converted G1994 (AorActSubj), and G2532 I should heal G2390 (AorMidDepSubj) them G0846.
028:028 Be it G2077 (PresImpr) known G1110 therefore G3767 unto you G5213, that G3754 the salvation G4992 of God G2316 is sent G0649 (Aor2PasDepSubj) unto the Gentiles G1484, and G2532 [that] they will hear G0191 (FutMidDepInd) it G0846.
028:029 And G2532 when he G0846 had said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) these words G5023, the Jews G2453 departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd), and had G2192 (PresActPtc) great G4183 reasoning G4803 among G1722 themselves G1438.
028:030 And G1161 Paul G3972 dwelt G3306 (AorActInd) two G1333 whole G3650 years G1333 in G1722 his own G2398 hired house G3410, and G2532 received G0588 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) all G3956 that came in G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) unto G4314 him G0846,
028:031 Preaching G2784 (PresActPtc) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, and G2532 teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) those things which concern G4012 the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424 Christ G5547, with G3326 all G3956 confidence G3954, no man forbidding him G0209.
