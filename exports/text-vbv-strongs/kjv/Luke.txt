001:001 ¶  Forasmuch G1895 as many G4183 have taken in hand G2021 (AorActInd) to set forth in order G0392 (AorMidDepInf) a declaration G1335 of G4012 those things G4229 which are most surely believed G4135 (PerfPasPtc) among G1722 us G2254,
001:002 Even G2531 as they delivered G3860 (Aor2ActInd) them unto us G2254, which G3588 from G0575 the beginning G0746 were G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) eyewitnesses G0845, and G2532 ministers G5257 of the word G3056;
001:003 It seemed G1380 (AorActInd) good to me also G2504, having had perfect G0199 understanding G3877 (PerfActPtc) of all things G3956 from the very first G0509, to write G1125 (AorActInf) unto thee G4671 in order G2517, most excellent G2903 Theophilus G2321,
001:004 That G2443 thou mightest know G1921 (Aor2ActSubj) the certainty G0803 of G4012 those things G3056, wherein G3739 thou hast been instructed G2727 (AorPasInd).
001:005 There was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 the days G2250 of Herod G2264, the king G0935 of Judaea G2449, a certain G5100 priest G2409 named G3686 Zacharias G2197, of G1537 the course G2183 of Abia G0007: and G2532 his G0846 wife G1135 [was] of G1537 the daughters G2364 of Aaron G0002, and G2532 her G0846 name G3686 [was] Elisabeth G1665.
001:006 And G1161 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) both G0297 righteous G1342 before G1799 God G2316, walking G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 all G3956 the commandments G1785 and G2532 ordinances G1345 of the Lord G2962 blameless G0273.
001:007 And G2532 they G0846 had G2258 (ImpfInd) no G3756 child G5043, because G2530 that Elisabeth G1665 was G2258 (ImpfInd) barren G4723, and G2532 they G0846 both G0297 were G2258 (ImpfInd) [now] well stricken G4260 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 years G2250.
001:008 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that while G1722 he G0846 executed the priest’s office G2407 (PresActInf) before G1725 God G2316 in G1722 the order G5010 of his G0846 course G2183,
001:009 According G2596 to the custom G1485 of the priest’s office G2405, his lot G2975 (Aor2ActInd) was to burn incense G2370 (AorActInf) when he went G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the temple G3485 of the Lord G2962.
001:010 And G2532 the whole G3956 multitude G4128 of the people G2992 were G2258 (ImpfInd) praying G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc) without G1854 at the time G5610 of incense G2368.
001:011 And G1161 there appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 an angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) on G1537 the right side G1188 of the altar G2379 of incense G2368.
001:012 And G2532 when Zacharias G2197 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [him], he was troubled G5015 (AorPasInd), and G2532 fear G5401 fell G1968 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 him G0846.
001:013 But G1161 the angel G0032 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361, Zacharias G2197: for G1360 thy G4675 prayer G1162 is heard G1522 (AorPasInd); and G2532 thy G4675 wife G1135 Elisabeth G1665 shall bear G1080 (FutActInd) thee G4671 a son G5207, and G2532 thou shalt call G2564 (FutActInd) his G0846 name G3686 John G2491.
001:014 And G2532 thou G4671 shalt have G2071 (FutInd) joy G5479 and G2532 gladness G0020; and G2532 many G4183 shall rejoice G5463 (Fut2PasDepInd) at G1909 his G0846 birth G1083.
001:015 For G1063 he shall be G2071 (FutInd) great G3173 in the sight G1799 of the Lord G2962, and G2532 shall drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj) neither G3364 wine G3631 nor G2532 strong drink G4608; and G2532 he shall be filled G4130 (FutPasInd) with the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, even G2089 from G1537 his G0846 mother’s G3384 womb G2836.
001:016 And G2532 many G4183 of the children G5207 of Israel G2474 shall he turn G1994 (FutActInd) to G1909 the Lord G2962 their G0846 God G2316.
001:017 And G2532 he G0846 shall go G4281 (FutMidDepInd) before G1799 him G0846 in G1722 the spirit G4151 and G2532 power G1411 of Elias G2243, to turn G1994 (AorActInf) the hearts G2588 of the fathers G3962 to G1909 the children G5043, and G2532 the disobedient G0545 to G1722 the wisdom G5428 of the just G1342; to make ready G2090 (AorActInf) a people G2992 prepared G2680 (PerfPasPtc) for the Lord G2962.
001:018 And G2532 Zacharias G2197 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the angel G0032, Whereby G2596 G5101 shall I know G1097 (FutMidDepInd) this G5124? for G1063 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) an old man G4246, and G2532 my G3450 wife G1135 well stricken G4260 (PerfActPtc) in G1722 years G2250 G0846.
001:019 And G2532 the angel G0032 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) Gabriel G1043, that stand G3936 (PerfActPtc) in the presence G1799 of God G2316; and G2532 am sent G0649 (Aor2PasDepSubj) to speak G2980 (AorActInf) unto G4314 thee G4571, and G2532 to shew G2097 thee G4671 these G5023 glad tidings G2097 (AorMidInf).
001:020 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), thou G2071 (FutInd) shalt be dumb G4623 (PresActPtc), and G2532 not G3361 able G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to speak G2980 (AorActInf), until G0891 the day G2250 that G3739 these things G5023 shall be performed G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj), because G0473 G3739 thou believest G4100 (AorActInd) not G3756 my G3450 words G3056, which G3748 shall be fulfilled G4137 (FutPasInd) in G1519 their G0846 season G2540.
001:021 And G2532 the people G2992 waited G2258 (ImpfInd) G4328 (PresActPtc) for Zacharias G2197, and G2532 marvelled G2296 (ImpfActInd) that G1722 he G0846 tarried so long G5549 (PresActInf) in G1722 the temple G3485.
001:022 And G1161 when he came out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), he could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) not G3756 speak G2980 (AorActInf) unto them G0846: and G2532 they perceived G1921 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 he had seen G3708 (PerfActInd) a vision G3701 in G1722 the temple G3485: for G2532 he G0846 beckoned G2258 (ImpfInd) G1269 (PresActPtc) unto them G0846, and G2532 remained G1265 (ImpfActInd) speechless G2974.
001:023 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, as soon as G5613 the days G2250 of his G0846 ministration G3009 were accomplished G4130 (AorPasInd), he departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 his own G0846 house G3624.
001:024 And G1161 after G3326 those G5025 days G2250 his G0846 wife G1135 Elisabeth G1665 conceived G4815 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 hid G4032 (ImpfActInd) herself G1438 five G4002 months G3376, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
001:025 G3754 Thus G3779 hath G4160 the Lord G2962 dealt G4160 (PerfActInd) with me G3427 in G1722 the days G2250 wherein G3739 he looked on G1896 (Aor2ActInd) [me], to take away G0851 (Aor2ActInf) my G3450 reproach G3681 among G1722 men G0444.
001:026 And G1161 in G1722 the sixth G1623 month G3376 the angel G0032 Gabriel G1043 was sent G0649 (Aor2PasDepSubj) from G5259 God G2316 unto G1519 a city G4172 of Galilee G1056, named G3739 G3686 Nazareth G3478,
001:027 To G4314 a virgin G3933 espoused G3423 (PerfPasPtc) to a man G0435 whose G3739 name G3686 was Joseph G2501, of G1537 the house G3624 of David G1138; and G2532 the virgin’s G3933 name G3686 [was] Mary G3137.
001:028 And G2532 the angel G0032 came in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) unto G4314 her G0846, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Hail G5463 (PresActImpr), [thou that art] highly favoured G5487 (PerfPasPtc), the Lord G2962 [is] with G3326 thee G4675: blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [art] thou G4771 among G1722 women G1135.
001:029 And G1161 when she saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [him], she was troubled G1298 (AorPasInd) at G1909 his G0846 saying G3056, and G2532 cast in her mind G1260 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) what manner G4217 of salutation G0783 this G3778 should be G1498 (PresOpt).
001:030 And G2532 the angel G0032 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361, Mary G3137: for G1063 thou hast found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) favour G5485 with G3844 God G2316.
001:031 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), thou shalt conceive G4815 (FutMidDepInd) in G1722 thy womb G1064, and G2532 bring forth G5088 (FutMidDepInd) a son G5207, and G2532 shalt call G2564 (FutActInd) his G0846 name G3686 JESUS G2424.
001:032 He G3778 shall be G2071 (FutInd) great G3173, and G2532 shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) the Son G5207 of the Highest G5310: and G2532 the Lord G2962 God G2316 shall give G1325 (FutActInd) unto him G0846 the throne G2362 of his G0846 father G3962 David G1138:
001:033 And G2532 he shall reign G0936 (FutActInd) over G1909 the house G3624 of Jacob G2384 for G1519 ever G0165; and G2532 of his G0846 kingdom G0932 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) no G3756 end G5056.
001:034 Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Mary G3137 unto G4314 the angel G0032, How G4459 shall G2071 this G5124 be G2071 (FutInd), seeing G1893 I know G1097 (PresActInd) not G3756 a man G0435?
001:035 And G2532 the angel G0032 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, The Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 shall come G1904 (FutMidDepInd) upon G1909 thee G4571, and G2532 the power G1411 of the Highest G5310 shall overshadow G1982 (FutActInd) thee G4671: therefore G1352 also G2532 that holy thing G0040 which shall be born G1080 (PresPasPtc) of G1537 thee G4675 shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316.
001:036 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), thy G4675 cousin G4773 Elisabeth G1665, she G0846 hath G4815 also G2532 conceived G4815 (PerfActPtc) a son G5207 in G1722 her G0846 old age G1094: and G2532 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the sixth G1623 month G3376 with her G0846, who G3588 was called G2564 (PresPasPtc) barren G4723.
001:037 For G3754 with G3844 God G2316 nothing G3756 G3956 G4487 shall be impossible G0101 (FutActInd).
001:038 And G1161 Mary G3137 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) the handmaid G1399 of the Lord G2962; be it G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt) unto me G3427 according G2596 to thy G4675 word G4487. And G2532 the angel G0032 departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 her G0846.
001:039 And G1161 Mary G3137 arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) in G1722 those G5025 days G2250, and went G4198 (AorPasDepInd) into G1519 the hill country G3714 with G3326 haste G4710, into G1519 a city G4172 of Juda G2448;
001:040 And G2532 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the house G3624 of Zacharias G2197, and G2532 saluted G0782 (AorMidDepInd) Elisabeth G1665.
001:041 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, when G5613 Elisabeth G1665 heard G0191 (AorActInd) the salutation G0783 of Mary G3137, the babe G1025 leaped G4640 (AorActInd) in G1722 her G0846 womb G2836; and G2532 Elisabeth G1665 was filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151:
001:042 And G2532 she spake out G0400 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [art] thou G4771 among G1722 women G1135, and G2532 blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [is] the fruit G2590 of thy G4675 womb G2836.
001:043 And G2532 whence G4159 [is] this G5124 to me G3427, that G2443 the mother G3384 of my G3450 Lord G2962 should come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) to G4314 me G3165?
001:044 For G1063, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), as soon as G5613 the voice G5456 of thy G4675 salutation G0783 sounded G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1519 mine G3450 ears G3775, the babe G1025 leaped G4640 (AorActInd) in G1722 my G3450 womb G2836 for G1722 joy G0020.
001:045 And G2532 blessed G3107 [is] she that believed G4100 (AorActPtc): for G3754 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) a performance G5050 of those things which were told G2980 (PerfPasPtc) her G0846 from G3844 the Lord G2962.
001:046 And G2532 Mary G3137 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), My G3450 soul G5590 doth magnify G3170 (PresActInd) the Lord G2962,
001:047 And G2532 my G3450 spirit G4151 hath rejoiced G0021 (AorActInd) in G1909 God G2316 my G3450 Saviour G4990.
001:048 For G3754 he hath regarded G1914 (AorActInd) G1909 the low estate G5014 of his G0846 handmaiden G1399: for G1063, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), from G0575 henceforth G3568 all G3956 generations G1074 shall call G3106 me G3165 blessed G3106 (FutActInd).
001:049 For G3754 he that is mighty G1415 hath done G4160 (AorActInd) to me G3427 great things G3167; and G2532 holy G0040 [is] his G0846 name G3686.
001:050 And G2532 his G0846 mercy G1656 [is] on them that fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) him G0846 from G1519 generation G1074 to generation G1074.
001:051 He hath shewed G4160 (AorActInd) strength G2904 with G1722 his G0846 arm G1023; he hath scattered G1287 (AorActInd) the proud G5244 in the imagination G1271 of their G0846 hearts G2588.
001:052 He hath put down G2507 (Aor2ActInd) the mighty G1413 from G0575 [their] seats G2362, and G2532 exalted G5312 (AorActInd) them of low degree G5011.
001:053 He hath filled G1705 (AorActInd) the hungry G3983 (PresActPtc) with good things G0018; and G2532 the rich G4147 (PresActPtc) he hath sent G1821 empty G2756 away G1821 (AorActInd).
001:054 He hath holpen G0482 (Aor2MidDepInd) his G0846 servant G3816 Israel G2474, in remembrance G3415 (AorPasInf) of [his] mercy G1656;
001:055 As G2531 he spake G2980 (AorActInd) to G4314 our G2257 fathers G3962, to Abraham G0011, and G2532 to his G0846 seed G4690 for G1519 ever G0165.
001:056 And G1161 Mary G3137 abode G3306 (AorActInd) with G4862 her G0846 about G5616 three G5140 months G3376, and G2532 returned G5290 (AorActInd) to G1519 her own G0846 house G3624.
001:057 Now G1161 Elisabeth’s G1665 full G4130 time G5550 came G4130 (AorPasInd) that she G0846 should be delivered G5088 (Aor2ActInf); and G2532 she brought forth G1080 (AorActInd) a son G5207.
001:058 And G2532 her neighbours G4040 and G2532 her G0846 cousins G4773 heard G0191 (AorActInd) how G3754 the Lord G2962 had shewed great G3170 (ImpfActInd) mercy G1656 G0846 upon G3326 her G0846; and G2532 they rejoiced G4796 (ImpfActInd) with her G0846.
001:059 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that on G1722 the eighth G3590 day G2250 they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to circumcise G4059 (Aor2ActInf) the child G3813; and G2532 they called G2564 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 Zacharias G2197, after G1909 the name G3686 of his G0846 father G3962.
001:060 And G2532 his G0846 mother G3384 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Not G3780 [so]; but G0235 he shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) John G2491.
001:061 And G2532 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 her G0846, G3754 There is G2076 (PresInd) none G3762 of G1722 thy G4675 kindred G4772 that G3739 is called G2564 (PresPasInd) by this G5129 name G3686.
001:062 And G1161 they made signs G1770 (ImpfActInd) to his G0846 father G3962, how G5101 G0302 he would have G2309 (PresActOpt) him G0846 called G2564 (PresPasInf).
001:063 And G2532 he asked for G0154 (AorActPtc) a writing table G4093, and wrote G1125 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), His G0846 name G3686 is G2076 (PresInd) John G2491. And G2532 they marvelled G2296 (AorActInd) all G3956.
001:064 And G1161 his G0846 mouth G4750 was opened G0455 (AorPasInd) immediately G3916, and G2532 his G0846 tongue G1100 [loosed], and G2532 he spake G2980 (ImpfActInd), and praised G2127 (PresActPtc) God G2316.
001:065 And G2532 fear G5401 came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) on G1909 all G3956 that dwelt round about G4039 (PresActPtc) them G0846: and G2532 all G3956 these G5023 sayings G4487 were noised abroad G1255 (ImpfPasInd) throughout G1722 all G3650 the hill country G3714 of Judaea G2449.
001:066 And G2532 all G3956 they that heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [them] laid [them] up G5087 (Aor2MidInd) in G1722 their G0846 hearts G2588, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 manner G0686 of child G3813 shall G2071 this G5124 be G2071 (FutInd)! And G2532 the hand G5495 of the Lord G2962 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 him G0846.
001:067 And G2532 his G0846 father G3962 Zacharias G2197 was filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, and G2532 prophesied G4395 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
001:068 Blessed G2128 [be] the Lord G2962 God G2316 of Israel G2474; for G3754 he hath visited G1980 (AorMidDepInd) and G2532 redeemed G3085 his G0846 people G2992 G4160 (AorActInd),
001:069 And G2532 hath raised up G1453 (AorActInd) an horn G2768 of salvation G4991 for us G2254 in G1722 the house G3624 of his G0846 servant G3816 David G1138;
001:070 As G2531 he spake G2980 (AorActInd) by G1223 the mouth G4750 of his G0846 holy G0040 prophets G4396, which G3588 have been since G0575 the world began G0165:
001:071 That we should be saved G4991 from G1537 our G2257 enemies G2190, and G2532 from G1537 the hand G5495 of all G3956 that hate G3404 (PresActPtc) us G2248;
001:072 To perform G4160 (AorActInf) the mercy G1656 [promised] to G3326 our G2257 fathers G3962, and G2532 to remember G3415 (AorPasInf) his G0846 holy G0040 covenant G1242;
001:073 The oath G3727 which G3739 he sware G3660 (AorActInd) to G4314 our G2257 father G3962 Abraham G0011,
001:074 That he would grant G1325 (Aor2ActInf) unto us G2254, that we being delivered G4506 (AorPasPtc) out of G1537 the hand G5495 of our G2257 enemies G2190 might serve G3000 (PresActInf) him G0846 without fear G0870,
001:075 In G1722 holiness G3742 and G2532 righteousness G1343 before G1799 him G0846, all G3956 the days G2250 of our G2257 life G2222.
001:076 And G2532 thou G4771, child G3813, shalt be called G2564 (FutPasInd) the prophet G4396 of the Highest G5310: for G1063 thou shalt go G4313 (FutMidDepInd) before G4253 the face G4383 of the Lord G2962 to prepare G2090 (AorActInf) his G0846 ways G3598;
001:077 To give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) knowledge G1108 of salvation G4991 unto his G0846 people G2992 by G1722 the remission G0859 of their G0846 sins G0266,
001:078 Through G1223 the tender G4698 mercy G1656 of our G2257 God G2316; whereby G1722 G3739 the dayspring G0395 from G1537 on high G5311 hath visited G1980 (AorMidDepInd) us G2248,
001:079 To give light G2014 (AorActInf) to them that sit G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 darkness G4655 and G2532 [in] the shadow G4639 of death G2288, to guide G2720 (AorActInf) our G2257 feet G4228 into G1519 the way G3598 of peace G1515.
001:080 And G1161 the child G3813 grew G0837 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 waxed strong G2901 (ImpfPasInd) in spirit G4151, and G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the deserts G2048 till G2193 the day G2250 of his G0846 shewing G0323 unto G4314 Israel G2474.
002:001 ¶  And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 those G1565 days G2250, that there went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) a decree G1378 from G3844 Caesar G2541 Augustus G0828, that all G3956 the world G3625 should be taxed G0583 (PresMidPasInf).
002:002 ([And] this G3778 taxing G0582 was G1096 first G4413 made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) when Cyrenius G2958 was governor G2230 (PresActPtc) of Syria G4947.)
002:003 And G2532 all G3956 went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to be taxed G0583 (PresPasInf), every one G1538 into G1519 his own G2398 city G4172.
002:004 And G1161 Joseph G2501 also G2532 went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 Galilee G1056, out of G1537 the city G4172 of Nazareth G3478, into G1519 Judaea G2449, unto G1519 the city G4172 of David G1138, which G3748 is called G2564 (PresPasInd) Bethlehem G0965; (because G1223 he G0846 was G1511 (PresInf) of G1537 the house G3624 and G2532 lineage G3965 of David G1138:)
002:005 To be taxed G0583 (AorMidInf) with G4862 Mary G3137 his G0846 espoused G3423 (PerfPasPtc) wife G1135, being G5607 (PresPtc) great with child G1471.
002:006 And G1161 so it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, while G1722 they G0846 were G1511 (PresInf) there G1563, the days G2250 were accomplished G4130 (AorPasInd) that she G0846 should be delivered G5088 (Aor2ActInf).
002:007 And G2532 she brought forth G5088 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846 firstborn G4416 son G5207, and G2532 wrapped G4683 him G0846 in swaddling clothes G4683 (AorActInd), and G2532 laid G0347 (AorActInd) him G0846 in G1722 a manger G5336; because G1360 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) no G3756 room G5117 for them G0846 in G1722 the inn G2646.
002:008 And G2532 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the same G0846 country G5561 shepherds G4166 abiding in the field G0063 (PresActPtc), G2532 keeping G5442 (PresActPtc) watch G5438 over G1909 their G0846 flock G4167 by night G3571.
002:009 And G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the angel G0032 of the Lord G2962 came upon G2186 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846, and G2532 the glory G1391 of the Lord G2962 shone round about G4034 (AorActInd) them G0846: and G2532 they were sore G3173 afraid G5399 (AorPasDepInd) G5401.
002:010 And G2532 the angel G0032 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361: for G1063, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I bring G2097 you G5213 good tidings G2097 (PresMidInd) of great G3173 joy G5479, which G3748 shall be G2071 (FutInd) to all G3956 people G2992.
002:011 For G3754 unto you G5213 is born G5088 (AorPasInd) this day G4594 in G1722 the city G4172 of David G1138 a Saviour G4990, which G3739 is G2076 (PresInd) Christ G5547 the Lord G2962.
002:012 And G2532 this G5124 [shall be] a sign G4592 unto you G5213; Ye shall find G2147 (FutActInd) the babe G1025 wrapped in swaddling clothes G4683 (PerfPasPtc), lying G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 a manger G5336.
002:013 And G2532 suddenly G1810 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) with G4862 the angel G0032 a multitude G4128 of the heavenly G3770 host G4756 praising G0134 (PresActPtc) God G2316, and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
002:014 Glory G1391 to God G2316 in G1722 the highest G5310, and G2532 on G1909 earth G1093 peace G1515, good will G2107 toward G1722 men G0444.
002:015 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G5613 the angels G0032 were gone away G0565 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 them G0846 into G1519 heaven G3772, G2532 the shepherds G0444 G4166 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) one G0240 to G4314 another G0240, Let us G1330 now G1211 go G1330 (Aor2ActSubj) even unto G2193 Bethlehem G0965, and G2532 see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) this G5124 thing G4487 which is come to pass G1096 (Perf2ActPtc), which G3739 G3588 the Lord G2962 hath made known G1107 (AorActInd) unto us G2254.
002:016 And G2532 they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) with haste G4692 (AorActPtc), and G2532 G5037 found G0429 (Aor2ActInd) Mary G3137, and G2532 Joseph G2501, and G2532 the babe G1025 lying G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 a manger G5336.
002:017 And G1161 when they had seen G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], they made known abroad G1232 (AorActInd) the saying G4012 G4487 which G3588 was told G2980 (AorPasPtc) them G0846 concerning G4012 this G5127 child G3813.
002:018 And G2532 all G3956 they that heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it] wondered G2296 (AorActInd) at G4012 those things which G3588 were told G2980 (AorPasPtc) them G4314 G0846 by G5259 the shepherds G4166.
002:019 But G1161 Mary G3137 kept G4933 (ImpfActInd) all G3956 these things G4487 G5023, and pondered G4820 (PresActPtc) [them] in G1722 her G0846 heart G2588.
002:020 And G2532 the shepherds G4166 returned G1994 (AorActInd), glorifying G1392 (PresActPtc) and G2532 praising G0134 (PresActPtc) God G2316 for G1909 all the things G3956 that G3739 they had heard G0191 (AorActInd) and G2532 seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd), as G2531 it was told G2980 (AorPasInd) unto G4314 them G0846.
002:021 And G2532 when G3753 eight G3638 days G2250 were accomplished G4130 (AorPasInd) for the circumcising G4059 (Aor2ActInf) of the child G3813, G2532 his G0846 name G3686 was called G2564 (AorPasInd) JESUS G2424, which G3588 was so named G2564 (AorPasPtc) of G5259 the angel G0032 before G4253 he G0846 was conceived G4815 (AorPasInf) in G1722 the womb G2836.
002:022 And G2532 when G3753 the days G2250 of her G0846 purification G2512 according G2596 to the law G3551 of Moses G3475 were accomplished G4130 (AorPasInd), they brought G0321 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 to G1519 Jerusalem G2414, to present G3936 (AorActInf) [him] to the Lord G2962;
002:023 (As G2531 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 the law G3551 of the Lord G2962, G3754 Every G3956 male G0730 that openeth G1272 (PresActPtc) the womb G3388 shall be called G2564 (FutPasInd) holy G0040 to the Lord G2962;)
002:024 And G2532 to offer G1325 (Aor2ActInf) a sacrifice G2378 according G2596 to that which is said G2046 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the law G3551 of the Lord G2962, A pair G2201 of turtledoves G5167, or G2228 two G1417 young G3502 pigeons G4058.
002:025 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a man G0444 in G1722 Jerusalem G2419, whose G3739 name G3686 [was] Simeon G4826; and G2532 the same G3778 man G0444 [was] just G1342 and G2532 devout G2126, waiting G4327 (PresMidPasDepPtc) for the consolation G3874 of Israel G2474: and G2532 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 was G2258 (ImpfInd) upon G1909 him G0846.
002:026 And G2532 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) revealed G5537 (PerfPasPtc) unto him G0846 by G5259 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151, that he should G1492 not G3361 see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) death G2288, before G4250 G2228 he had seen G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) the Lord’s G2962 Christ G5547.
002:027 And G2532 he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) by G1722 the Spirit G4151 into G1519 the temple G2411: and G2532 when the parents G1118 brought G1521 (Aor2ActInf) in G1722 the child G3813 Jesus G2424, to do G4160 (AorActInf) G0846 for G4012 him G0846 after G2596 the custom G1480 (PerfPasPtc) of the law G3551,
002:028 Then G2532 took G1209 he G0846 him G0846 up G1209 (AorMidDepInd) in G1519 his G0846 arms G0043, and G2532 blessed G2127 (AorActInd) God G2316, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd),
002:029 Lord G1203, now G3568 lettest thou G0630 thy G4675 servant G1401 depart G0630 (PresActInd) in G1722 peace G1515, according G2596 to thy G4675 word G4487:
002:030 For G3754 mine G3450 eyes G3788 have seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) thy G4675 salvation G4992,
002:031 Which G3739 thou hast prepared G2090 (AorActInd) before G2596 the face G4383 of all G3956 people G2992;
002:032 A light G5457 to G1519 lighten G0602 the Gentiles G1484, and G2532 the glory G1391 of thy G4675 people G2992 Israel G2474.
002:033 And G2532 Joseph G2501 and G2532 his G0846 mother G3384 marvelled G2258 (ImpfInd) G2296 (PresActPtc) at G1909 those things which were spoken G2980 (PresPasPtc) of G4012 him G0846.
002:034 And G2532 Simeon G4826 blessed G2127 (AorActInd) them G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 Mary G3137 his G0846 mother G3384, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), this G3778 [child] is set G2749 (PresMidPasDepInd) for G1519 the fall G4431 and G2532 rising again G0386 of many G4183 in G1722 Israel G2474; and G2532 for G1519 a sign G4592 which shall be spoken against G0483 (PresPasPtc);
002:035 (Yea G1161, a sword G4501 shall pierce through G1330 (FutMidDepInd) thy G4675 own G0846 soul G5590 also G2532,) that G3704 the thoughts G1261 of G1537 many G4183 hearts G2588 G0302 may be revealed G0601 (AorPasSubj).
002:036 And G2532 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) one Anna G0451, a prophetess G4398, the daughter G2364 of Phanuel G5323, of G1537 the tribe G5443 of Aser G0768: she G3778 G0846 was of a great G4183 G1722 age G2250 G4260 (PerfActPtc), and had lived G2198 (AorActPtc) with G3326 an husband G0435 seven G2033 years G2094 from G0575 her G0846 virginity G3932;
002:037 And G2532 she G3778 [was] a widow G5503 of about G5613 fourscore G3589 and four G5064 years G2094, which G3739 departed G0868 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) not G3756 from G0575 the temple G2411, but served G3000 (PresActPtc) [God] with fastings G3521 and G2532 prayers G1162 night G3571 and G2532 day G2250.
002:038 And G2532 she G3778 G0846 coming in G2186 (Aor2ActPtc) that G0846 instant G5610 gave thanks likewise G0437 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) unto the Lord G2962, and G2532 spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) of G4012 him G0846 to all G3956 them that looked G4327 (PresMidPasDepPtc) for redemption G3085 in G1722 Jerusalem G2419.
002:039 And G2532 when G5613 they had performed G5055 (AorActInd) all things G0537 according G2596 to the law G3551 of the Lord G2962, they returned G5290 (AorActInd) into G1519 Galilee G1056, to G1519 their own G0846 city G4172 Nazareth G3478.
002:040 And G1161 the child G3813 grew G0837 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 waxed strong G2901 (ImpfPasInd) in spirit G4151, filled G4137 (PresPasPtc) with wisdom G4678: and G2532 the grace G5485 of God G2316 was G2258 (ImpfInd) upon G1909 him G0846.
002:041 Now G2532 his G0846 parents G1118 went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419 every G2596 year G2094 at the feast G1859 of the passover G3957.
002:042 And G2532 when G3753 he was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) twelve G1427 years old G2094, they G0846 went up G0305 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414 after G2596 the custom G1485 of the feast G1859.
002:043 And G2532 when they had fulfilled G5048 (AorActPtc) the days G2250, as G1722 they G0846 returned G5290 (PresActInf), the child G3816 Jesus G2424 tarried behind G5278 (AorActInd) in G1722 Jerusalem G2419; and G2532 Joseph G2501 and G2532 his G0846 mother G3384 knew G1097 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 [of it].
002:044 But G1161 they, supposing G3543 (AorActPtc) him G0846 to have been G1511 (PresInf) in G1722 the company G4923, went G2064 (Aor2ActInd) a day’s G2250 journey G3598; and G2532 they sought G0327 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 among G1722 [their] kinsfolk G4773 and G2532 G1722 acquaintance G1110.
002:045 And G2532 when they found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 not G3361, they turned back again G5290 (AorActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, seeking G2212 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
002:046 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that after G3326 three G5140 days G2250 they found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 in G1722 the temple G2411, sitting G2516 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the midst G3319 of the doctors G1320, both G2532 hearing G0191 (PresActPtc) them G0846, and G2532 asking G1905 them G0846 questions G1905 (PresActPtc).
002:047 And G1161 all G3956 that heard G0191 (PresActPtc) him G0846 were astonished G1839 (ImpfMidInd) at G1909 his G0846 understanding G4907 and G2532 answers G0612.
002:048 And G2532 when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, they were amazed G1605 (Aor2PasDepSubj): and G2532 his G0846 mother G3384 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Son G5043, why G5101 hast thou G4160 thus G3779 dealt G4160 (AorActInd) with us G2254? behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), thy G4675 father G3962 and I G2504 have sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) thee G4571 sorrowing G3600 (PresPasPtc).
002:049 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, How G5101 is it that G3754 ye sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) me G3165? wist ye G1492 (PlupfActInd) not G3756 that G3754 I G3165 must G1163 (PresInd) be G1511 (PresInf) about G1722 my G3450 Father’s business G3962?
002:050 And G2532 they G0846 understood G4920 (AorActInd) not G3756 the saying G4487 which G3739 he spake G2980 (AorActInd) unto them G0846.
002:051 And G2532 he went down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) with G3326 them G0846, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Nazareth G3478, and G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) subject G5293 (PresPasPtc) unto them G0846: but G2532 his G0846 mother G3384 kept G1301 (ImpfActInd) all G3956 these G5023 sayings G4487 in G1722 her G0846 heart G2588.
002:052 And G2532 Jesus G2424 increased G4298 (ImpfActInd) in wisdom G4678 and G2532 stature G2244, and G2532 in favour G5485 with G3844 God G2316 and G2532 man G0444.
003:001 ¶  Now G1161 in G1722 the fifteenth G4003 year G2094 of the reign G2231 of Tiberius G5086 Caesar G2541, Pontius G4194 Pilate G4091 being governor G2230 (PresActPtc) of Judaea G2449, and G2532 Herod G2264 being tetrarch G5075 (PresActPtc) of Galilee G1056, and G1161 his G0846 brother G0080 Philip G5376 tetrarch G5075 (PresActPtc) of Ituraea G2484 and G2532 of the region G5561 of Trachonitis G5139, and G2532 Lysanias G3078 the tetrarch G5075 (PresActPtc) of Abilene G0009,
003:002 Annas G0452 and G2532 Caiaphas G2533 being G1909 the high priests G0749, the word G4487 of God G2316 came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) unto G1909 John G2491 the son G5207 of Zacharias G2197 in G1722 the wilderness G2048.
003:003 And G2532 he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 all G3956 the country about G4066 Jordan G2446, preaching G2784 (PresActPtc) the baptism G0908 of repentance G3341 for G1519 the remission G0859 of sins G0266;
003:004 As G5613 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 the book G0976 of the words G3056 of Esaias G2268 the prophet G4396, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), The voice G5456 of one crying G0994 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the wilderness G2048, Prepare ye G2090 (AorActImpr) the way G3598 of the Lord G2962, make G4160 (PresActImpr) his G0846 paths G5147 straight G2117.
003:005 Every G3956 valley G5327 shall be G2071 (FutInd) filled G4137 (FutPasInd), and G2532 every G3956 mountain G3735 and G2532 hill G1015 shall be brought low G5013 (FutPasInd); and G2532 the crooked G4646 shall be made G1519 straight G2117, and G2532 the rough G5138 ways G3598 [shall be] made G1519 smooth G3006;
003:006 And G2532 all G3956 flesh G4561 shall see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) the salvation G4992 of God G2316.
003:007 Then G3767 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) he to the multitude G3793 that came forth G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to be baptized G0907 (AorPasInf) of G5259 him G0846, O generation G1081 of vipers G2191, who G5101 hath warned G5263 (AorActInd) you G5213 to flee G5343 (Aor2ActInf) from G0575 the wrath G3709 to come G3195 (PresActPtc)?
003:008 Bring forth G4160 (AorActImpr) therefore G3767 fruits G2590 worthy G0514 of repentance G3341, and G2532 begin G0756 (AorMidSubj) not G3361 to say G3004 (PresActInf) within G1722 yourselves G1438, We have G2192 (PresActInd) Abraham G0011 to [our] father G3962: for G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 God G2316 is able G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) of G1537 these G5130 stones G3037 to raise up G1453 (AorActInf) children G5043 unto Abraham G0011.
003:009 And G1161 now G2235 also G2532 the axe G0513 is laid G2749 (PresMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 the root G4491 of the trees G1186: every G3956 tree G1186 therefore G3767 which bringeth G4160 not G3361 forth G4160 (PresActPtc) good G2570 fruit G2590 is hewn down G1581 (PresPasInd), and G2532 cast G0906 (PresPasInd) into G1519 the fire G4442.
003:010 And G2532 the people G3793 asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 shall we do G4160 (FutActInd) then G3767?
003:011 He answereth G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) two G1417 coats G5509, let him impart G3330 (Aor2ActImpr) to him that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) none G3361; and G2532 he that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) meat G1033, let him do G4160 (PresActImpr) likewise G3668.
003:012 Then G1161 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) also G2532 publicans G5057 to be baptized G0907 (AorPasInf), and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Master G1320, what G5101 shall we do G4160 (FutActInd)?
003:013 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Exact G4238 (PresActInd) no G3367 more G4119 than G3844 that which is appointed G1299 (PerfPasPtc) you G5213.
003:014 And G1161 the soldiers G4754 (PresMidPtc) likewise G2532 demanded G1905 (ImpfActInd) of him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), And G2532 what G5101 shall we G2249 do G4160 (FutActInd)? And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Do violence G1286 (AorActSubj) to no man G3367, neither G3366 accuse [any] falsely G4811 (AorActSubj); and G2532 be content G0714 (PresPasImpr) with your G5216 wages G3800.
003:015 And G1161 as the people G2992 were in expectation G4328 (PresActPtc), and G2532 all men G3956 mused G1260 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 their G0846 hearts G2588 of G4012 John G2491, whether G3379 he G0846 were G1498 (PresOpt) the Christ G5547, or not G3379;
003:016 John G2491 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto [them] all G0537, I G1473 indeed G3303 baptize G0907 (PresActInd) you G5209 with water G5204; but G1161 one mightier than G2478 I G3450 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), the latchet G2438 of whose G3739 G0846 shoes G5266 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G2425 to unloose G3089 (AorActInf): he G0846 shall baptize G0907 (FutActInd) you G5209 with G1722 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 and G2532 with fire G4442:
003:017 Whose G3739 fan G4425 [is] in G1722 his G0846 hand G5495, and G2532 he will throughly purge G1245 (FutActInd) his G0846 floor G0257, and G2532 will gather G4863 (FutActInd) the wheat G4621 into G1519 his G0846 garner G0596; but G1161 the chaff G0892 he will burn G2618 (FutActInd) with fire G4442 unquenchable G0762.
003:018 And G2532 G3767 many G4183 other G2087 things G4183 G3303 in his exhortation G3870 (PresActPtc) preached G2097 (ImpfMidInd) he unto the people G2992.
003:019 But G1161 Herod G2264 the tetrarch G5076, being reproved G1651 (PresPasPtc) by G5259 him G0846 for G4012 Herodias G2266 his G0846 brother G0080 Philip’s G5376 wife G1135, and G2532 for G4012 all G3956 the evils G4190 which G3739 Herod G2264 had done G4160 (AorActInd),
003:020 Added G4369 (AorActInd) yet G2532 this G5124 above G1909 all G3956, that G2532 he shut up G2623 (AorActInd) John G2491 in G1722 prison G5438.
003:021 Now G1161 when all G0537 the people G2992 were baptized G1722 G0907 (AorPasInf), it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that Jesus G2424 also G2532 being baptized G0907 (AorPasPtc), and G2532 praying G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc), the heaven G3772 was opened G0455 (AorPasInf),
003:022 And G2532 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 descended G2597 (Aor2ActInf) in a bodily G4984 shape G1491 like G5616 a dove G4058 upon G1909 him G0846, and G2532 a voice G5456 came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) from G1537 heaven G3772, which said G3004 (PresActPtc), Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) my G3450 beloved G0027 Son G5207; in G1722 thee G4671 I am well pleased G2106 (AorActInd).
003:023 And G2532 Jesus G2424 himself G0846 began G0756 (PresMidPtc) to be G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5616 thirty G5144 years of age G2094, being G5607 (PresPtc) (as G5613 was supposed G3543 (ImpfPasInd) ) the son G5207 of Joseph G2501, which was [the son] of Heli G2242,

004:001 ¶  And G1161 Jesus G2424 being full G4134 of the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 returned G5290 (AorActInd) from G0575 Jordan G2446, and G2532 was led G0071 (ImpfPasInd) by G1722 the Spirit G4151 into G1519 the wilderness G2048,
004:002 Being G3985 forty G5062 days G2250 tempted G3985 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 the devil G1228. And G2532 in G1722 those G1565 days G2250 he did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) nothing G3756 G3762: and G2532 when they G0846 were ended G4931 (AorPasPtc), he afterward G5305 hungered G3983 (AorActInd).
004:003 And G2532 the devil G1228 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, If G1487 thou be G1488 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316, command G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) this G5129 stone G3037 that G2443 it be made G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) bread G0740.
004:004 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G4314 G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), It is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), That G3754 man G0444 shall G2198 not G3756 live G2198 (FutMidDepInd) by G1909 bread G0740 alone G3441, but G0235 by G1909 every G3956 word G4487 of God G2316.
004:005 And G2532 the devil G1228, taking G0321 him G0846 up G0321 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 an high G5308 mountain G3735, shewed G1166 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 all G3956 the kingdoms G0932 of the world G3625 in G1722 a moment G4743 of time G5550.
004:006 And G2532 the devil G1228 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, All G0537 this G5026 power G1849 will I give G1325 (FutActInd) thee G4671, and G2532 the glory G1391 of them G0846: for G3754 that is delivered G3860 (PerfPasInd) unto me G1698; and G2532 to G3739 whomsoever G1437 I will G2309 (PresActSubj) I give G1325 (PresActInd) it G0846.
004:007 If G1437 thou G4771 therefore G3767 wilt worship G4352 (AorActSubj) me G1799 G3450, all G3956 shall be G2071 (FutInd) thine G4675.
004:008 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Get thee G5217 (PresActImpr) behind G3694 me G3450, Satan G4567: for G1063 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), Thou shalt worship G4352 (FutActInd) the Lord G2962 thy G4675 God G2316, and G2532 him G0846 only G3441 shalt thou serve G3000 (FutActInd).
004:009 And G2532 he brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, and G2532 set G2476 (AorActInd) him G0846 on G1909 a pinnacle G4419 of the temple G2411, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, If G1487 thou be G1488 (PresInd) the Son G5207 of God G2316, cast G0906 (Aor2ActImpr) thyself G4572 down G2736 from hence G1782:
004:010 For G1063 G3754 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), He shall give G1781 his G0846 angels G0032 charge G1781 (FutMidPasDepInd) over G4012 thee G4675, to keep G1314 (AorActInf) thee G4571:
004:011 And G2532 G3754 in G1909 [their] hands G5495 they shall bear G0142 thee G4571 up G0142 (FutActInd), lest at any time G3379 thou dash G4350 (AorActSubj) thy G4675 foot G4228 against G4314 a stone G3037.
004:012 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, It is said G3754 G2046 (PerfPasInd), Thou shalt G1598 not G3756 tempt G1598 (FutActInd) the Lord G2962 thy G4675 God G2316.
004:013 And G2532 when the devil G1228 had ended G4931 (AorActPtc) all G3956 the temptation G3986, he departed G0868 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 him G0846 for G0891 a season G2540.
004:014 And G2532 Jesus G2424 returned G5290 (AorActInd) in G1722 the power G1411 of the Spirit G4151 into G1519 Galilee G1056: and G2532 there went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) a fame G5345 of G4012 him G0846 through G2596 all G3650 the region round about G4066.
004:015 And G2532 he G0846 taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) in G1722 their G0846 synagogues G4864, being glorified G1392 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 all G3956.
004:016 And G2532 he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Nazareth G3478, where G3757 he had been G2258 (ImpfInd) brought up G5142 (PerfPasPtc): and G2532, as G2596 his G0846 custom G1486 (Perf2ActPtc) was G2596, he went G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the synagogue G4864 on G1722 the sabbath G4521 day G2250, and G2532 stood up G0450 (Aor2ActInd) for to read G0314 (Aor2ActInf).
004:017 And G2532 there was delivered G1929 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 the book G0975 of the prophet G4396 Esaias G2268. And G2532 when he had opened G0380 (AorActPtc) the book G0975, he found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) the place G5117 where G3757 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) written G1125 (PerfPasPtc),
004:018 The Spirit G4151 of the Lord G2962 [is] upon G1909 me G1691, because G1752 he hath anointed G5548 (AorActInd) me G3165 to preach the gospel G2097 (PresMidInf) to the poor G4434; he hath sent G0649 (PerfActInd) me G3165 to heal G2390 (AorMidDepInf) the brokenhearted G4937 (PerfPasPtc) G2588, to preach G2784 (AorActInf) deliverance G0859 to the captives G0164, and G2532 recovering of sight G0309 to the blind G5185, to set G0649 (AorActInf) at G1722 liberty G0859 them that are bruised G2352 (PerfPasPtc),
004:019 To preach G2784 (AorActInf) the acceptable G1184 year G1763 of the Lord G2962.
004:020 And G2532 he closed G4428 (AorActPtc) the book G0975, and he gave [it] again G0591 (Aor2ActPtc) to the minister G5257, and sat down G2523 (AorActInd). And G2532 the eyes G3788 of all them G3956 that were G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the synagogue G4864 were fastened G0816 (PresActPtc) on him G0846.
004:021 And G1161 he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf) unto G4314 them G0846, This G3754 day G4594 is G4137 this G3778 scripture G1124 fulfilled G4137 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 your G5216 ears G3775.
004:022 And G2532 all G3956 bare G3140 him G0846 witness G3140 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 wondered G2296 (ImpfActInd) at G1909 the gracious G5485 words G3056 which G3588 proceeded G1607 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G1537 his G0846 mouth G4750. And G2532 they said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 this G3778 Joseph’s G2501 son G5207?
004:023 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Ye will G2046 surely G3843 say G2046 (FutActInd) unto me G3427 this G5026 proverb G3850, Physician G2395, heal G2323 (AorActImpr) thyself G4572: whatsoever G3745 we have heard G0191 (AorActInd) done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) in G1722 Capernaum G2584, do G4160 (AorActImpr) also G2532 here G5602 in G1722 thy G4675 country G3968.
004:024 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 No G3762 prophet G4396 is G2076 (PresInd) accepted G1184 in G1722 his own G0846 country G3968.
004:025 But G1161 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213 of G1909 a truth G0225, many G4183 widows G5503 were G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 Israel G2474 in G1722 the days G2250 of Elias G2243, when G3753 the heaven G3772 was shut up G2808 (AorPasInd) G1909 three G5140 years G2094 and G2532 six G1803 months G3376, when G5613 great G3173 famine G3042 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) throughout G1909 all G3956 the land G1093;
004:026 But G2532 unto G4314 none G3762 of them G0846 was G3992 Elias G2243 sent G3992 (AorPasInd), save G1508 unto G1519 Sarepta G4558, [a city] of Sidon G4605, unto G4314 a woman G1135 [that was] a widow G5503.
004:027 And G2532 many G4183 lepers G3015 were G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 Israel G2474 in the time G1909 of Eliseus G1666 the prophet G4396; and G2532 none G3762 of them G0846 was cleansed G2511 (AorPasInd), saving G1508 Naaman G3497 the Syrian G4948.
004:028 And G2532 all they G3956 in G1722 the synagogue G4864, when they heard G0191 (PresActPtc) these things G5023, were filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with wrath G2372,
004:029 And G2532 rose up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and thrust G1544 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 out of G1854 the city G4172, and G2532 led G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 unto G2193 the brow G3790 of the hill G3735 whereon G1909 G3739 their G0846 city G4172 was built G3618 (PlupfPasInd), that G1519 they might cast G2630 him G0846 down headlong G2630 (AorActInf).
004:030 But G1161 he G0846 passing G1330 (Aor2ActPtc) through G1223 the midst G3319 of them G0846 went his way G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd),
004:031 And G2532 came down G2718 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 Capernaum G2584, a city G4172 of Galilee G1056, and G2532 taught G1321 (PresActPtc) them G0846 G2258 (ImpfInd) on G1722 the sabbath days G4521.
004:032 And G2532 they were astonished G1605 (ImpfPasInd) at G1909 his G0846 doctrine G1322: for G3754 his G0846 word G3056 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G1722 power G1849.
004:033 And G2532 in G1722 the synagogue G4864 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a man G0444, which had G2192 (PresActPtc) a spirit G4151 of an unclean G0169 devil G1140, and G2532 cried out G0349 (AorActInd) with a loud G3173 voice G5456,
004:034 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Let [us] alone G1436; what G5101 have we to do G2254 with thee G4671, G2532 [thou] Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3479? art thou come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to destroy G0622 (AorActInf) us G2248? I know G1492 (PerfActInd) thee G4571 who G5101 thou art G1488 (PresInd); the Holy One G0040 of God G2316.
004:035 And G2532 Jesus G2424 rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Hold thy peace G5392 (AorPasImpr), and G2532 come G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) out of G1537 him G0846. And G2532 when the devil G1140 had thrown G4496 (AorActPtc) him G0846 in G1519 the midst G3319, he came G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G0575 him G0846, and hurt G0984 (AorActPtc) him G0846 not G3367.
004:036 And G2532 they were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) all G1909 G3956 amazed G2285, and G2532 spake G4814 (ImpfActInd) among G4314 themselves G0240, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 a word G3056 [is] this G3778! for G3754 with G1722 authority G1849 and G2532 power G1411 he commandeth G2004 (PresActInd) the unclean G0169 spirits G4151, and G2532 they come out G1831 (PresMidPasDepInd).
004:037 And G2532 the fame G2279 of G4012 him G0846 went out G1607 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) into G1519 every G3956 place G5117 of the country round about G4066.
004:038 And G1161 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G1537 the synagogue G4864, and entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Simon’s G4613 house G3614. And G1161 Simon’s G4613 wife’s mother G3994 was G2258 (ImpfInd) taken with G4912 (PresPasPtc) a great G3173 fever G4446; and G2532 they besought G2065 (AorActInd) him G0846 for G4012 her G0846.
004:039 And G2532 he stood G2186 (Aor2ActPtc) over G1883 her G0846, and rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) the fever G4446; and G2532 it left G0863 (AorActInd) her G0846: and immediately G3916 she arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) and G1161 ministered G1247 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846.
004:040 Now G1161 when the sun G2246 was setting G1416 (PresActPtc), all G3956 they that G3745 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) any sick G0770 (PresActPtc) with divers G4164 diseases G3554 brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 unto G4314 him G0846; and G1161 he laid G2007 his hands G5495 on G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) every G1538 one G1520 of them G0846, and healed G2323 (AorActInd) them G0846.
004:041 And G1161 devils G1140 also G2532 came G1831 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) out of G0575 many G4183, crying out G2896 (PresActPtc), and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) Christ G5547 the Son G5207 of God G2316. And G2532 he rebuking G2008 (PresActPtc) [them] suffered G1439 (ImpfActInd) them G0846 not G3756 to speak G2980 (PresActInf): for G3754 they knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) that he G0846 was G1511 (PresInf) Christ G5547.
004:042 And G1161 when it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) day G2250, he departed G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) and went G4198 (AorPasDepInd) into G1519 a desert G2048 place G5117: and G2532 the people G3793 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G2193 him G0846, and G2532 stayed G2722 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, that he should not G3361 depart G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) from G0575 them G0846.
004:043 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, G3754 I G3165 must G1163 (PresInd) preach G2097 (AorMidInf) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 to other G2087 cities G4172 also G2532: for G3754 therefore G1519 G5124 am I sent G0649 (PerfPasInd).
004:044 And G2532 he preached G2258 (ImpfInd) G2784 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the synagogues G4864 of Galilee G1056.
005:001 ¶  And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, as G1722 the people G3793 pressed upon G1945 (PresMidPasDepInf) him G0846 to hear G0191 (PresActInf) the word G3056 of God G2316, G2532 he G0846 stood G2258 (ImpfInd) G2476 (PerfActPtc) by G3844 the lake G3041 of Gennesaret G1082,
005:002 And G2532 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) two G1417 ships G4143 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) by G3844 the lake G3041: but G1161 the fishermen G0231 were gone G0576 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G0575 them G0846, and were washing G0637 (AorActInd) [their] nets G1350.
005:003 And G1161 he entered G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 one G1520 of the ships G4143, which G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) Simon’s G4613, and prayed G2065 (AorActInd) him G0846 that he would thrust out G1877 (Aor2ActInf) a little G3641 from G0575 the land G1093. And G2532 he sat down G2523 (AorActPtc), and taught G1321 (ImpfActInd) the people G3793 out of G1537 the ship G4143.
005:004 Now G1161 when G5613 he had left G3973 (AorMidInd) speaking G2980 (PresActPtc), he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 Simon G4613, Launch out G1877 (Aor2ActImpr) into G1519 the deep G0899, and G2532 let down G5465 (AorActImpr) your G5216 nets G1350 for G1519 a draught G0061.
005:005 And G2532 Simon G4613 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Master G1988, we have toiled G2872 (AorActPtc) all G3650 G1223 the night G3571, and have taken G2983 (Aor2ActInd) nothing G3762: nevertheless G1161 at G1909 thy G4675 word G4487 I will let down G5465 (FutActInd) the net G1350.
005:006 And G2532 when they had G4160 this G5124 done G4160 (AorActPtc), they inclosed G4788 (AorActInd) a great G4183 multitude G4128 of fishes G2486: and G1161 their G0846 net G1350 brake G1284 (ImpfPasInd).
005:007 And G2532 they beckoned G2656 (AorActInd) unto [their] partners G3353, which G3588 were in G1722 the other G2087 ship G4143, that they should come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and help G4815 (Aor2MidInf) them G0846. And G2532 they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 filled G4130 (AorActInd) both G0297 the ships G4143, so G5620 that they G0846 began to sink G1036 (PresPasInf).
005:008 When G1161 Simon G4613 Peter G4074 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he fell down at G4363 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 ’ knees G1119, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Depart G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) from G0575 me G1700; for G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) a sinful G0268 man G0435, O Lord G2962.
005:009 For G1063 he G0846 was astonished G4023 (Aor2ActInd) G2285, and G2532 all G3956 that were G4862 with him G0846, at G1909 the draught G0061 of the fishes G2486 which G3739 they had taken G4815 (Aor2ActInd):
005:010 And G1161 so G3668 [was] also G2532 James G2385, and G2532 John G2491, the sons G5207 of Zebedee G2199, which G3739 were G2258 (ImpfInd) partners G2844 with Simon G4613. And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 Simon G4613, Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361; from G0575 henceforth G3568 thou shalt G2071 (FutInd) catch G2221 (PresActPtc) men G0444.
005:011 And G2532 when they had brought G2609 (Aor2ActPtc) their ships G4143 to G1909 land G1093, they forsook G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) all G0537, and followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
005:012 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), when he G0846 was G1511 (PresInf) G1722 in G1722 a certain G3391 city G4172, G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a man G0435 full G4134 of leprosy G3014: who G2532 seeing G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) Jesus G2424 fell G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) on G1909 [his] face G4383, and besought G1189 (AorPasInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, if G1437 thou wilt G2309 (PresActSubj), thou canst G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) make G2511 me G3165 clean G2511 (AorActInf).
005:013 And G2532 he put forth G1614 (AorActPtc) [his] hand G5495, and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), I will G2309 (PresActInd): be thou clean G2511 (AorPasImpr). And G2532 immediately G2112 the leprosy G3014 departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 him G0846.
005:014 And G2532 he G0846 charged G3853 (AorActInd) him G0846 to tell G2036 (Aor2ActInf) no man G3367: but G0235 go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc), and shew G1166 (AorActImpr) thyself G4572 to the priest G2409, and G2532 offer G4374 (Aor2ActImpr) for G4012 thy G4675 cleansing G2512, according as G2531 Moses G3475 commanded G4367 (AorActInd), for G1519 a testimony G3142 unto them G0846.
005:015 But G1161 so much the more G3123 went there G1330 a fame G3056 abroad G1330 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) of G4012 him G0846: and G2532 great G4183 multitudes G3793 came together G4905 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to hear G0191 (PresActInf), and G2532 to be healed G2323 (PresPasInf) by G5259 him G0846 of G0575 their G0846 infirmities G0769.
005:016 And G1161 he withdrew G2258 (ImpfInd) G5298 (PresActPtc) himself G0846 into G1722 the wilderness G2048, and G2532 prayed G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
005:017 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) on G1722 a certain G3391 day G2250, as G2532 he G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) teaching G1321 (PresActPtc), that G2532 there were G2258 (ImpfInd) Pharisees G5330 and G2532 doctors of the law G3547 sitting by G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc), which G3739 were G2258 (ImpfInd) come G2064 (Perf2ActPtc) out of G1537 every G3956 town G2968 of Galilee G1056, and G2532 Judaea G2449, and G2532 Jerusalem G2419: and G2532 the power G1411 of the Lord G2962 was G2258 (ImpfInd) [present] to G1519 heal G2390 (PresMidPasDepInf) them G0846.
005:018 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), men G0435 brought G5342 (PresActPtc) in G1909 a bed G2825 a man G0444 which G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) taken with a palsy G3886 (PerfPasPtc): and G2532 they sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) [means] to bring G1533 him G0846 in G1533 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 to lay G5087 (Aor2ActInf) [him] before G1799 him G0846.
005:019 And G2532 when they could G2147 not G3361 find G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) by G1223 what G4169 [way] they might bring G1533 him G0846 in G1533 (Aor2ActSubj) because G1223 of the multitude G3793, they went G0305 (Aor2ActPtc) upon G1909 the housetop G1430, and let G2524 him G0846 down G2524 (AorActInd) through G1223 the tiling G2766 with G4862 [his] couch G2826 into G1519 the midst G3319 before G1715 Jesus G2424.
005:020 And G2532 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 faith G4102, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Man G0444, thy G4675 sins G0266 are forgiven G0863 (PerfPasInd) thee G4671.
005:021 And G2532 the scribes G1122 and G2532 the Pharisees G5330 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to reason G1260 (PresMidPasDepInf), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Who G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778 which G3739 speaketh G2980 (PresActInd) blasphemies G0988? Who G5101 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) forgive G0863 (PresActInf) sins G0266, but G1508 God G2316 alone G3441?
005:022 But G1161 when Jesus G2424 perceived G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) their G0846 thoughts G1261, he answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, What G5101 reason ye G1260 (PresMidPasDepInd) in G1722 your G5216 hearts G2588?
005:023 Whether G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) easier G2123, to say G2036 (Aor2ActInf), Thy G4675 sins G0266 be forgiven G0863 (PerfPasInd) thee G4671; or G2228 to say G2036 (Aor2ActInf), Rise up G1453 (AorMidImpr) and G2532 walk G4043 (PresActImpr)?
005:024 But G1161 that G2443 ye may know G1492 (PerfActSubj) that G3754 the Son G5207 of man G0444 hath G2192 (PresActInd) power G1849 upon G1909 earth G1093 to forgive G0863 (PresActInf) sins G0266, (he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the sick of the palsy G3886 (PerfPasPtc),) I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, Arise G1453 (AorMidImpr), and G2532 take up G0142 (AorActPtc) thy G4675 couch G2826, and go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) into G1519 thine G4675 house G3624.
005:025 And G2532 immediately G3916 he rose up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) before G1799 them G0846, and took up G0142 (AorActPtc) that whereon G1909 G3739 he lay G2621 (ImpfMidPasDepInd), and departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 his own G0846 house G3624, glorifying G1392 (PresActPtc) God G2316.
005:026 And G2532 they were G2983 (Aor2ActInd) all G0537 amazed G1611, and G2532 they glorified G1392 (ImpfActInd) God G2316, and G2532 were filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with fear G5401, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 We have seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) strange things G3861 to day G4594.
005:027 And G2532 after G3326 these things G5023 he went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 saw G2300 (AorMidDepInd) a publican G5057, named G3686 Levi G3018, sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) at G1909 the receipt of custom G5058: and G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
005:028 And G2532 he left G2641 (Aor2ActPtc) all G0537, rose up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
005:029 And G2532 Levi G3018 made G4160 (AorActInd) him G0846 a great G3173 feast G1403 in G1722 his own G0846 house G3614: and G2532 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a great G4183 company G3793 of publicans G5057 and G2532 of others G0243 that G3739 sat down G2258 (ImpfInd) G2621 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with G3326 them G0846.
005:030 But G2532 their G0846 scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330 murmured G1111 (ImpfActInd) against G4314 his G0846 disciples G3101, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Why G1302 do ye eat G2068 (PresActInd) and G2532 drink G4095 (PresActInd) with G3326 publicans G5057 and G2532 sinners G0268?
005:031 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, They that are whole G5198 (PresActPtc) need G5532 G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 a physician G2395; but G0235 they that are G2192 (PresActPtc) sick G2560.
005:032 I came G2064 (Perf2ActInd) not G3756 to call G2564 (AorActInf) the righteous G1342, but G0235 sinners G0268 to G1519 repentance G3341.
005:033 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Why G1302 do G3522 the disciples G3101 of John G2491 fast G3522 (PresActInd) often G4437, and G2532 make G4160 (PresMidInd) prayers G1162, and G2532 likewise G3668 [the disciples G3588 ] of the Pharisees G5330; but G1161 thine G4674 eat G2068 (PresActInd) and G2532 drink G4095 (PresActInd)?
005:034 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, G3361 Can ye G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) make G4160 (AorActInf) the children G5207 of the bridechamber G3567 fast G3522 (PresActInf), while G3739 G1722 the bridegroom G3566 is G2076 (PresInd) with G3326 them G0846?
005:035 But G1161 the days G2250 will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd), when G3752 G2532 the bridegroom G3566 shall be taken away G0522 (AorPasSubj) from G0575 them G0846, and then G5119 shall they fast G3522 (FutActInd) in G1722 those G1565 days G2250.
005:036 And G1161 he spake G3004 (ImpfActInd) also G2532 a parable G3850 unto G4314 them G0846; G3754 No man G3762 putteth G1911 (PresActInd) a piece G1915 of a new G2537 garment G2440 upon G1909 an old G2440 G3820; if otherwise, then G1490 both G2532 the new G2537 maketh a rent G4977 (PresActInd), and G2532 the piece G1915 that was [taken] out of G0575 the new G2537 agreeth G4856 (PresActInd) not G3756 with the old G3820.
005:037 And G2532 no man G3762 putteth G0906 (PresActInd) new G3501 wine G3631 into G1519 old G3820 bottles G0779; else G1490 the new G3501 wine G3631 will burst G4486 (FutActInd) the bottles G0779, and G2532 G0846 be spilled G1632 (FutPasInd), and G2532 the bottles G0779 shall perish G0622 (FutMidInd).
005:038 But G0235 new G3501 wine G3631 must be put G0992 into G1519 new G2537 bottles G0779; and G2532 both G0297 are preserved G4933 (PresPasInd).
005:039 No man G3762 also G2532 having drunk G4095 (Aor2ActPtc) old G3820 [wine] straightway G2112 desireth G2309 (PresActInd) new G3501: for G1063 he saith G3004 (PresActInd), The old G3820 is G2076 (PresInd) better G5543.
006:001 ¶  And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) on G1722 the second G1207 sabbath G4521 after the first G1207, that he G0846 went G1279 (PresMidPasDepInf) through G1223 the corn fields G4702; and G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101 plucked G5089 (ImpfActInd) the ears of corn G4719, and G2532 did eat G2068 (ImpfActInd), rubbing G5597 (PresActPtc) [them] in [their] hands G5495.
006:002 And G1161 certain G5100 of the Pharisees G5330 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 do ye G4160 (PresActInd) that which G3739 is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) to do G4160 (PresActInf) on G1722 the sabbath days G4521?
006:003 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) them G4314 G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Have ye G0314 not G3761 read G0314 (Aor2ActInd) so much as G3761 this G5124, what G3739 David G1138 did G4160 (AorActInd), when G3698 himself G0846 was an hungred G3983 (AorActInd), and G2532 they which G3588 were G5607 (PresPtc) with G3326 him G0846;
006:004 How G5613 he went G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the house G3624 of God G2316, and G2532 did take G2983 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) the shewbread G0740 G4286, and G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) also G2532 to them that were with G3326 him G0846; which G3739 it is G1832 not G3756 lawful G1832 (PresInd) to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) but for G1508 the priests G2409 alone G3441?
006:005 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, That G3754 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) Lord G2962 also G2532 of the sabbath G4521.
006:006 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) also G2532 on G1722 another G2087 sabbath G4521, that he G0846 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the synagogue G4864 and G2532 taught G1321 (PresActInf): and G2532 there G1563 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a man G0444 whose G2532 G0846 right G1188 hand G5495 was G2258 (ImpfInd) withered G3584.
006:007 And G1161 the scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330 watched G3906 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, whether G1487 he would heal G2323 (FutActInd) on G1722 the sabbath day G4521; that G2443 they might find G2147 (Aor2ActSubj) an accusation G2724 against him G0846.
006:008 But G1161 he G0846 knew G1492 (PlupfActInd) their G0846 thoughts G1261, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to the man G0444 which G3588 had G2192 (PresActPtc) the withered G3584 hand G5495, Rise up G1453 (AorMidImpr), and G2532 stand forth G2476 (Aor2ActImpr) in G1519 the midst G3319. And G1161 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) and stood forth G2476 (Aor2ActInd).
006:009 Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto G4314 them G0846, I will ask G1905 (FutActInd) you G5209 one thing G5101; Is it lawful G1832 (PresInd) on the sabbath days G4521 to do good G0015 (AorActInf), or G2228 to do evil G2554 (AorActInf)? to save G4982 (AorActInf) life G5590, or G2228 to destroy G0622 (AorActInf) [it]?
006:010 And G2532 looking round about upon G4017 (AorMidPtc) them G0846 all G3956, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the man G0444, Stretch forth G1614 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 hand G5495. And G1161 he did G4160 (AorActInd) so G3779: and G2532 his G0846 hand G5495 was restored G0600 (AorPasInd) whole G5199 as G5613 the other G0243.
006:011 And G1161 they G0846 were filled G4130 (AorPasInd) with madness G0454; and G2532 communed G1255 (ImpfActInd) one with another G4314 G0240 what G5101 G0302 they might do G4160 (AorActOpt) to Jesus G2424.
006:012 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 those G5025 days G2250, that he went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a mountain G3735 to pray G4336 (AorMidDepInf), and G2532 continued all night G1273 (PresActPtc) G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 prayer G4335 to God G2316.
006:013 And G2532 when G3753 it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) day G2250, he called G4377 (AorActInd) [unto him] his G0846 disciples G3101: and G2532 of G0575 them G0846 he chose G1586 (AorMidPtc) twelve G1427, whom G3739 also G2532 he named G3687 (AorActInd) apostles G0652;
006:014 Simon G4613, (whom G3739 he also G2532 named G3687 (AorActInd) Peter G4074,) and G2532 Andrew G0406 his G0846 brother G0080, James G2385 and G2532 John G2491, Philip G5376 and G2532 Bartholomew G0918,
006:015 Matthew G3156 and G2532 Thomas G2381, James G2385 the G3588 [son] of Alphaeus G0256, and G2532 Simon G4613 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Zelotes G2208,
006:016 And Judas G2455 [the brother] of James G2385, and G2532 Judas G2455 Iscariot G2469, which G3739 also G2532 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) the traitor G4273.
006:017 And G2532 he came down G2597 (Aor2ActPtc) with G3326 them G0846, and stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) in G1909 the plain G3977 G5117, and G2532 the company G3793 of his G0846 disciples G3101, and G2532 a great G4183 multitude G4128 of people G2992 out of G0575 all G3956 Judaea G2449 and G2532 Jerusalem G2419, and G2532 from the sea coast G3882 of Tyre G5184 and G2532 Sidon G4605, which G3739 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to hear G0191 (AorActInf) him G0846, and G2532 to be healed G2390 (AorPasInf) of G0575 their G0846 diseases G3554;
006:018 And G2532 they that were vexed G3791 (PresPasPtc) with G5259 unclean G0169 spirits G4151: and G2532 they were healed G2323 (ImpfPasInd).
006:019 And G2532 the whole G3956 multitude G3793 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to touch G0680 (PresMidInf) him G0846: for G3754 there went G1831 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) virtue G1411 out G3844 of him G0846, and G2532 healed G2390 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) [them] all G3956.
006:020 And G2532 he G0846 lifted up G1869 (AorActPtc) his G0846 eyes G3788 on G1519 his G0846 disciples G3101, and said G3004 (ImpfActInd), Blessed G3107 [be ye] poor G4434: for G3754 yours G5212 is G2076 (PresInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
006:021 Blessed G3107 [are ye] that hunger G3983 (PresActPtc) now G3568: for G3754 ye shall be filled G5526 (FutPasInd). Blessed G3107 [are ye] that weep G2799 (PresActPtc) now G3568: for G3754 ye shall laugh G1070 (FutActInd).
006:022 Blessed G3107 are ye G2075 (PresInd), when G3752 men G0444 shall hate G3404 (AorActSubj) you G5209, and G2532 when G3752 they shall separate G0873 (AorActSubj) you G5209 [from their company], and G2532 shall reproach G3679 (AorActSubj) [you], and G2532 cast out G1544 (Aor2ActSubj) your G5216 name G3686 as G5613 evil G4190, for the Son G5207 of man’s G0444 sake G1752.
006:023 Rejoice ye G5463 (PresActImpr) in G1722 that G1565 day G2250, and G2532 leap for joy G4640 (AorActImpr): for G1063, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), your G5216 reward G3408 [is] great G4183 in G1722 heaven G3772: for G1063 in G2596 the like manner G5024 did G4160 (ImpfActInd) their G0846 fathers G3962 unto the prophets G4396.
006:024 But G4133 woe G3759 unto you G5213 that are rich G4145! for G3754 ye have received G0568 (PresActInd) your G5216 consolation G3874.
006:025 Woe G3759 unto you G5213 that are full G1705 (PerfPasPtc)! for G3754 ye shall hunger G3983 (FutActInd). Woe G3759 unto you G5213 that laugh G1070 (PresActPtc) now G3568! for G3754 ye shall mourn G3996 (FutActInd) and G2532 weep G2799 (FutActInd).
006:026 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, when G3752 all G3956 men G0444 shall speak G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) well G2573 of you G5209! for G1063 so G5024 G2596 did G4160 (ImpfActInd) their G0846 fathers G3962 to the false prophets G5578.
006:027 But G0235 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 which G3588 hear G0191 (PresActPtc), Love G0025 (PresActImpr) your G5216 enemies G2190, do G4160 (PresActImpr) good G2573 to them which G3588 hate G3404 (PresActPtc) you G5209,
006:028 Bless G2127 (PresActImpr) them that curse G2672 (PresMidPasDepPtc) you G5213, and G2532 pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr) for G5228 them which despitefully use G1908 (PresActPtc) you G5209.
006:029 And unto him that smiteth G5180 (PresActPtc) thee G4571 on G1909 the [one] cheek G4600 offer G3930 (PresActImpr) also G2532 the other G0243; and G2532 him G0575 that taketh away G0142 (PresActPtc) thy G4675 cloke G2440 forbid G2967 (AorActSubj) not G3361 [to take thy] coat G5509 also G2532.
006:030 G1161 Give G1325 (PresActImpr) to every man G3956 that asketh G0154 (PresActPtc) of thee G4571; and G2532 of G0575 him that taketh away G0142 (PresActPtc) thy goods G4674 ask G0523 [them] not G3361 again G0523 (PresActImpr).
006:031 And G2532 as G2531 ye would G2309 (PresActInd) that G2443 men G0444 should do G4160 (PresActSubj) to you G5213, do G4160 (PresActImpr) ye G5210 also G2532 to them G0846 likewise G3668.
006:032 For G2532 if G1487 ye love G0025 (PresActInd) them which love G0025 (PresActPtc) you G5209, what G4169 thank G5485 have G2076 (PresInd) ye G5213? for G1063 sinners G0268 also G2532 love G0025 (PresActPtc) those that love G0025 (PresActInd) them G0846.
006:033 And G2532 if G1437 ye do good G0015 (PresActSubj) to them which do good G0015 (PresActPtc) to you G5209, what G4169 thank G5485 have G2076 (PresInd) ye G5213? for G1063 sinners G0268 also do G4160 (PresActInd) even G2532 the same G0846.
006:034 And G2532 if G1437 ye lend G1155 (PresActSubj) [to them] of G3844 whom G3739 ye hope G1679 (PresActInd) G1679 (PresActSubj) to receive G0618 (Aor2ActInf), what G4169 thank G5485 have G2076 (PresInd) ye G5213? for G1063 sinners G0268 also G2532 lend G1155 (PresActInd) to sinners G0268, to G2443 receive G0618 as much G2470 again G0618 (Aor2ActSubj).
006:035 But G4133 love ye G0025 (PresActImpr) your G5216 enemies G2190, and G2532 do good G0015 (PresActImpr), and G2532 lend G1155 (PresActImpr), hoping G0560 for nothing G3367 again G0560 (PresActPtc); and G2532 your G5216 reward G3408 shall be G2071 (FutInd) great G4183, and G2532 ye shall be G2071 (FutInd) the children G5207 of the Highest G5310: for G3754 he G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) kind G5543 unto G1909 the unthankful G0884 and G2532 [to] the evil G4190.
006:036 Be ye G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) therefore G3767 merciful G3629, as G2531 your G5216 Father G3962 also G2532 is G2076 (PresInd) merciful G3629.
006:037 G2532 Judge G2919 (PresActImpr) not G3361, and G2532 ye shall G2919 not G3364 be judged G2919 (AorPasSubj): condemn G2613 (PresActImpr) not G3361, and G2532 ye shall G2613 not G3364 be condemned G2613 (AorPasSubj): forgive G0630 (PresActImpr), and G2532 ye shall be forgiven G0630 (FutPasInd):
006:038 Give G1325 (PresActImpr), and G2532 it shall be given G1325 (FutPasInd) unto you G5213; good G2570 measure G3358, pressed down G4085 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 shaken together G4531 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 running over G5240 (PresPasPtc), shall men give G1325 (FutActInd) into G1519 your G5216 bosom G2859. For G1063 with the same G0846 measure G3358 that G3739 ye mete withal G3354 (PresActInd) it shall be measured G0488 to you G5213 again G0488 (FutPasInd).
006:039 And G1161 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) a parable G3850 unto them G0846, G3385 Can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) the blind G5185 lead G3594 (PresActInf) the blind G5185? shall they G0297 not G3780 both G0297 fall G4098 (FutMidPasDepInd) into G1519 the ditch G0999?
006:040 The disciple G3101 is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 above G5228 his G0846 master G1320: but G1161 every one G3956 that is perfect G2675 (PerfPasPtc) shall be G2071 (FutInd) as G5613 his G0846 master G1320.
006:041 And G1161 why G5101 beholdest thou G0991 (PresActInd) the mote G2595 that is in G1722 thy G4675 brother’s G0080 eye G3788, but G1161 perceivest G2657 (PresActInd) not G3756 the beam G1385 that is in G1722 thine own G2398 eye G3788?
006:042 Either G2228 how G4459 canst thou G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) say G3004 (PresActInf) to thy G4675 brother G0080, Brother G0080, let me G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) pull out G1544 (Aor2ActSubj) the mote G2595 that is in G1722 thine G4675 eye G3788, when thou G0991 thyself G0846 beholdest G0991 (PresActPtc) not G3756 the beam G1385 that is in G1722 thine G4675 own eye G3788? Thou hypocrite G5273, cast out G1544 (Aor2ActImpr) first G4412 the beam G1385 out of G1537 thine own G4675 eye G3788, and G2532 then G5119 shalt thou see clearly G1227 (FutActInd) to pull out G1544 (Aor2ActInf) the mote G2595 that is in G1722 thy G4675 brother’s G0080 eye G3788.
006:043 For G1063 a good G2570 tree G1186 bringeth G2076 (PresInd) G4160 not G3756 forth G4160 (PresActPtc) corrupt G4550 fruit G2590; neither G3761 doth G4160 a corrupt G4550 tree G1186 bring forth G4160 (PresActPtc) good G2570 fruit G2590.
006:044 For G1063 every G1538 tree G1186 is known G1097 (PresPasInd) by G1537 his own G2398 fruit G2590. For G1063 of G1537 thorns G0173 men do not G3756 gather G4816 (PresActInd) figs G4810, nor G3761 of G1537 a bramble bush G0942 gather they G5166 (PresActInd) grapes G4718.
006:045 A good G0018 man G0444 out of G1537 the good G0018 treasure G2344 of his G0846 heart G2588 bringeth forth G4393 (PresActInd) that which is good G0018; and G2532 an evil G4190 man G0444 out of G1537 the evil G4190 treasure G2344 of his G0846 heart G2588 bringeth forth G4393 (PresActInd) that which is evil G4190: for G1063 of G1537 the abundance G4051 of the heart G2588 his G0846 mouth G4750 speaketh G2980 (PresActInd).
006:046 And G1161 why G5101 call ye G2564 (PresActInd) me G3165, Lord G2962, Lord G2962, and G2532 do G4160 (PresActInd) not G3756 the things which G3739 I say G3004 (PresActInd)?
006:047 Whosoever G3956 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G4314 me G3165, and G2532 heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) my G3450 sayings G3056, and G2532 doeth G4160 (PresActPtc) them G0846, I will shew G5263 (FutActInd) you G5213 to whom G5101 he is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664:
006:048 He is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 a man G0444 which G3739 built G3618 (PresActPtc) an house G3614, and G2532 digged G4626 (AorActInd) deep G0900 (AorActInd), and G2532 laid G5087 (AorActInd) the foundation G2310 on G1909 a rock G4073: and G1161 when the flood G4132 arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), the stream G4215 beat vehemently G4366 (AorActInd) upon that G1565 house G3614, and G2532 could G2480 (AorActInd) not G3756 shake G4531 (AorActInf) it G0846: for G1063 it was founded G2311 (PlupfPasInd) upon G1909 a rock G4073.
006:049 But G1161 he that heareth G0191 (AorActPtc), and G2532 doeth G4160 (AorActPtc) not G3361, is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 a man G0444 that without G5565 a foundation G2310 built G3618 (AorActPtc) an house G3614 upon G1909 the earth G1093; against G4366 which G3739 the stream G4215 did beat vehemently G4366 (AorActInd), and G2532 immediately G2112 it fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd); and G2532 the ruin G4485 of that G1565 house G3614 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) great G3173.
007:001 ¶  Now G1161 when G1893 he had ended G4137 (AorActInd) all G3956 his G0846 sayings G4487 in G1519 the audience G0189 of the people G2992, he entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 Capernaum G2584.
007:002 And G1161 a certain G5100 centurion’s G1543 servant G1401, who G3739 was G2258 (ImpfInd) dear G1784 unto him G0846, was G2192 (PresActPtc) sick G2560, and ready G3195 (ImpfActInd) to die G5053 (PresActInf).
007:003 And G1161 when he heard G0191 (AorActPtc) of G4012 Jesus G2424, he sent G0649 (AorActInd) unto G4314 him G0846 the elders G4245 of the Jews G2453, beseeching G2065 (PresActPtc) him G0846 that G3704 he would come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and heal G1295 (AorActSubj) his G0846 servant G1401.
007:004 And G1161 when they came G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) to G4314 Jesus G2424, they besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 instantly G4709, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), That G3754 he was G2076 (PresInd) worthy G0514 for whom G3739 he should do G3930 (FutActInd) this G5124:
007:005 For G1063 he loveth G0025 (PresActInd) our G2257 nation G1484, and G2532 he G0846 hath built G3618 (AorActInd) us G2254 a synagogue G4864.
007:006 Then G1161 Jesus G2424 went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) with G4862 them G0846. And G1161 when he G0846 was G0568 (PresActPtc) now G2235 not G3756 far G3112 from G0575 the house G3614, the centurion G1543 sent G3992 (AorActInd) friends G5384 to G4314 him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, trouble G4660 not G3361 thyself G4660 (PresPasImpr): for G1063 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 worthy G2425 that G2443 thou shouldest enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) under G5259 my G3450 roof G4721:
007:007 Wherefore G1352 neither G3761 thought I G0515 myself G1683 worthy G0515 (AorActInd) to come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) unto G4314 thee G4571: but G0235 say G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) in a word G3056, and G2532 my G3450 servant G3816 shall be healed G2390 (FutPasInd).
007:008 For G1063 I G1473 also G2532 am G1510 (PresInd) a man G0444 set G5021 (PresPasPtc) under G5259 authority G1849, having G2192 (PresActPtc) under G5259 me G1683 soldiers G4757, and G2532 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto one G5129, Go G4198 (AorPasDepImpr), and G2532 he goeth G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd); and G2532 to another G0243, Come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 he cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd); and G2532 to my G3450 servant G1401, Do G4160 (AorActImpr) this G5124, and G2532 he doeth G4160 (PresActInd) [it].
007:009 When G1161 Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) these things G5023, he marvelled G2296 (AorActInd) at him G0846, and G2532 turned him about G4762 (Aor2PasPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the people G3793 that followed G0190 (PresActPtc) him G0846, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, I have not found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) so great G5118 faith G4102, no, not G3761 in G1722 Israel G2474.
007:010 And G2532 they that were sent G3992 (AorPasPtc), returning G5290 (AorActPtc) to G1519 the house G3624, found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) the servant G1401 whole G5198 (PresActPtc) that had been sick G0770 (PresActPtc).
007:011 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) G1722 the day after G1836, that he went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) into G1519 a city G4172 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Nain G3484; and G2532 many G2425 of his G0846 disciples G3101 went with G4848 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) him G0846, and G2532 much G4183 people G3793.
007:012 Now G1161 when G5613 he came nigh G1448 (AorActInd) to the gate G4439 of the city G4172, behold G2532 G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there was G1580 a dead man G2348 (PerfActPtc) carried out G1580 (ImpfPasInd), the only G3439 son G5207 of his G0846 mother G3384, and G2532 she G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a widow G5503: and G2532 much G2425 people G3793 of the city G4172 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G4862 her G0846.
007:013 And G2532 when the Lord G2962 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) her G0846, he had compassion G4697 (AorPasDepInd) on G1909 her G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Weep G2799 (PresActImpr) not G3361.
007:014 And G2532 he came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) the bier G4673: and G1161 they that bare G0941 (PresActPtc) [him] stood still G2476 (Aor2ActInd). And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Young man G3495, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, Arise G1453 (AorPasImpr).
007:015 And G2532 he that was dead G3498 sat up G0339 (AorActInd), and G2532 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to speak G2980 (PresActInf). And G2532 he delivered G1325 (AorActInd) him G0846 to his G0846 mother G3384.
007:016 And G1161 there came G2983 (Aor2ActInd) a fear G5401 on all G0537: and G2532 they glorified G1392 (ImpfActInd) God G2316, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), That G3754 a great G3173 prophet G4396 is risen up G1453 (PerfPasInd) among G1722 us G2254; and G2532, That G3754 God G2316 hath visited G1980 (AorMidDepInd) his G0846 people G2992.
007:017 And G2532 this G3778 rumour G3056 of G4012 him G0846 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActInd) throughout G1722 all G3650 Judaea G2449, and G2532 throughout G1722 all G3956 the region round about G4066.
007:018 And G2532 the disciples G3101 of John G2491 shewed G0518 (AorActInd) him G0846 of G4012 all G3956 these things G5130.
007:019 And G2532 John G2491 calling G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) [unto him] two G1417 G5100 of his G0846 disciples G3101 sent G3992 (AorActInd) [them] to G4314 Jesus G2424, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 he that should come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc)? or G2228 look we for G4328 (PresActSubj) another G0243?
007:020 When G1161 the men G0435 were come G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) unto G4314 him G0846, they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), John G2491 Baptist G0910 hath sent G0649 (PerfActInd) us G2248 unto G4314 thee G4571, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 he that should come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc)? or G2228 look we for G4328 (PresActInd/PresActSubj) another G0243?
007:021 And G1161 in G1722 that same G0846 hour G5610 he cured G2323 (AorActInd) many G4183 of G0575 [their] infirmities G3554 and G2532 plagues G3148, and G2532 of evil G4190 spirits G4151; and G2532 unto many G4183 [that were] blind G5185 he gave G5483 (AorMidDepInd) sight G0991 (PresActInf).
007:022 Then G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Go your way G4198 (AorPasDepPtc), and tell G0518 (AorActImpr) John G2491 what things G3739 ye have seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 heard G0191 (AorActInd); how G3754 that the blind G5185 see G0308 (PresActInd), the lame G5560 walk G4043 (PresActInd), the lepers G3015 are cleansed G2511 (PresPasInd), the deaf G2974 hear G0191 (PresActInd), the dead G3498 are raised G1453 (PresPasInd), to the poor G4434 the gospel is preached G2097 (PresPasInd).
007:023 And G2532 blessed G3107 is G2076 (PresInd) [he], whosoever G3739 shall G4624 not G3362 be offended G4624 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 me G1698.
007:024 And G1161 when the messengers G0032 of John G2491 were departed G0565 (Aor2ActPtc), he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to speak G3004 (PresActInf) unto G4314 the people G3793 concerning G4012 John G2491, What G5101 went ye out G1831 (PerfActInd) into G1519 the wilderness G2048 for to see G2300 (AorMidDepInf)? A reed G2563 shaken G4531 (PresPasPtc) with G5259 the wind G0417?
007:025 But G0235 what G5101 went ye out G1831 (PerfActInd) for to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf)? A man G0444 clothed G0294 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 soft G3120 raiment G2440? Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), they which are G1722 gorgeously G1741 apparelled G2441, and G2532 live G5225 (PresActPtc) delicately G5172, are G1526 (PresInd) in G1722 kings’ courts G0933.
007:026 But G0235 what G5101 went ye out G1831 (PerfActInd) for to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf)? A prophet G4396? Yea G3483, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, and G2532 much more G4055 than a prophet G4396.
007:027 This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) [he], of G4012 whom G3739 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 send G0649 (PresActInd) my G3450 messenger G0032 before G4253 thy G4675 face G4383, which G3739 shall prepare G2680 (FutActInd) thy G4675 way G3598 before G1715 thee G4675.
007:028 For G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Among G1722 those that are born G1084 of women G1135 there is G2076 (PresInd) not G3762 a greater G3187 prophet G4396 than G3187 John G2491 the Baptist G0910: but G1161 he that is least G3398 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) greater than G3187 he G0846.
007:029 And G2532 all G3956 the people G2992 that heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [him], and G2532 the publicans G5057, justified G1344 (AorActInd) God G2316, being baptized G0907 (AorPasPtc) with the baptism G0908 of John G2491.
007:030 But G1161 the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 lawyers G3544 rejected G0114 (AorActInd) the counsel G1012 of God G2316 against G1519 themselves G1438, being G0907 not G3361 baptized G0907 (AorPasPtc) of G5259 him G0846.
007:031 And G1161 the Lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Whereunto G5101 then G3767 shall I liken G3666 (FutActInd) the men G0444 of this G5026 generation G1074? and G2532 to what G5101 are they G1526 (PresInd) like G3664?
007:032 They are G1526 (PresInd) like G3664 unto children G3813 sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the marketplace G0058, and G2532 calling G4377 (PresActInd/PresActPtc) one to another G0240, and G2532 saying G3004 (PresActInd/PresActPtc), We have piped G0832 (AorActInd) unto you G5213, and G2532 ye have G3738 not G3756 danced G3738 (AorMidDepInd); we have mourned G2354 (AorActInd) to you G5213, and G2532 ye have G2799 not G3756 wept G2799 (AorActInd).
007:033 For G1063 John G2491 the Baptist G0910 came G2064 (Perf2ActInd) neither G3383 eating G2068 (PresActPtc) bread G0740 nor G3383 drinking G4095 (PresActPtc) wine G3631; and G2532 ye say G3004 (PresActInd), He hath G2192 (PresActInd) a devil G1140.
007:034 The Son G5207 of man G0444 is come G2064 (Perf2ActInd) eating G2068 (PresActPtc) and G2532 drinking G4095 (PresActPtc); and G2532 ye say G3004 (PresActInd), Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a gluttonous G5314 man G0444, and G2532 a winebibber G3630, a friend G5384 of publicans G5057 and G2532 sinners G0268!
007:035 But G2532 wisdom G4678 is justified G1344 (AorPasInd) of G0575 all G3956 her G0846 children G5043.
007:036 And G1161 one G5100 of the Pharisees G5330 desired G2065 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that G2443 he would eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) with G3326 him G0846. And G2532 he went G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the Pharisee’s G5330 house G3614, and sat down to meat G0347 (AorPasInd).
007:037 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a woman G1135 in G1722 the city G4172, which G3748 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a sinner G0268, when she knew G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 [Jesus] sat at meat G0345 (PresMidPasDepInd) in G1722 the Pharisee’s G5330 house G3614, brought G2865 (AorActPtc) an alabaster box G0211 of ointment G3464,
007:038 And G2532 stood G2476 (Aor2ActPtc) at G3844 his G0846 feet G4228 behind G3694 [him] weeping G2799 (PresActPtc), and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to wash G1026 (PresActInf) his G0846 feet G4228 with tears G1144, and G2532 did wipe G1591 (ImpfActInd) [them] with the hairs G2359 of her G0846 head G2776, and G2532 kissed G2705 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 feet G4228, and G2532 anointed G0218 (ImpfActInd) [them] with the ointment G3464.
007:039 Now G1161 when the Pharisee G5330 which G3588 had bidden G2564 (AorActPtc) him G0846 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) within G1722 himself G1438, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This man G3778, if G1487 he were G2258 (ImpfInd) a prophet G4396, G0302 would have known G1097 (ImpfActInd) who G5101 and G2532 what manner G4217 of woman G1135 [this is] that G3748 toucheth G0680 (PresMidInd) him G0846: for G3754 she is G2076 (PresInd) a sinner G0268.
007:040 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Simon G4613, I have G2192 (PresActInd) somewhat G5100 to say G2036 (Aor2ActInf) unto thee G4671. And G1161 he saith G5346 (PresInd), Master G1320, say on G2036 (Aor2ActImpr).
007:041 There was G2258 (ImpfInd) a certain G5100 creditor G1157 which had two G1417 debtors G5533: the one G1520 owed G3784 (ImpfActInd) five hundred G4001 pence G1220, and G1161 the other G2087 fifty G4004.
007:042 And G1161 when they G0846 had G2192 (PresActPtc) nothing G3361 to pay G0591 (Aor2ActInf), he frankly forgave G5483 (AorMidDepInd) them both G0297. Tell me G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) therefore G3767, which G5101 of them G0846 will love G0025 (FutActInd) him G0846 most G4119?
007:043 Simon G4613 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I suppose G5274 (PresActInd) that G3754 [he], to whom G3739 he forgave G5483 (AorMidDepInd) most G4119. And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thou hast G2919 rightly G3723 judged G2919 (AorActInd).
007:044 And G2532 he turned G4762 (Aor2PasPtc) to G4314 the woman G1135, and said G5346 (ImpfInd) unto Simon G4613, Seest thou G0991 (PresActInd) this G5026 woman G1135? I entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 thine G4675 house G3614, thou gavest me G1325 (AorActInd) no G3756 water G5204 for G1909 my G3450 feet G4228: but G1161 she G3778 G0846 hath washed G1026 (AorActInd) my G3450 feet G4228 with tears G1144, and G2532 wiped G1591 (AorActInd) [them] with the hairs G2359 of her G0846 head G2776.
007:045 Thou gavest G1325 (AorActInd) me G3427 no G3756 kiss G5370: but G1161 this woman G3778 G0846 since G0575 the time G3739 I came in G1525 (Aor2ActInd) hath G1257 not G3756 ceased G1257 (Aor2ActInd) to kiss G2705 (PresActPtc) my G3450 feet G4228.
007:046 My G3450 head G2776 with oil G1637 thou didst G0218 not G3756 anoint G0218 (AorActInd): but G1161 this woman G3778 G0846 hath anointed G0218 (AorActInd) my G3450 feet G4228 with ointment G3464.
007:047 Wherefore G3739 G5484 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, Her G0846 sins G0266, which G3588 are many G4183, are forgiven G0863 (PerfPasInd); for G3754 she loved G0025 (AorActInd) much G4183: but G1161 to whom G3739 little G3641 is forgiven G0863 (PresPasInd), [the same] loveth G0025 (PresActInd) little G3641.
007:048 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Thy G4675 sins G0266 are forgiven G0863 (PerfPasInd).
007:049 And G2532 they that sat at meat with him G4873 (PresMidPasDepPtc) began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf) within G1722 themselves G1438, Who G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778 that G3739 forgiveth G0863 (PresActInd) sins G0266 also G2532?
007:050 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 the woman G1135, Thy G4675 faith G4102 hath saved G4982 (PerfActInd) thee G4571; go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) in G1519 peace G1515.
008:001 ¶  And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) afterward G1722 G2517, that G2532 he G0846 went G1353 (ImpfActInd) throughout every G2596 city G4172 and G2532 village G2968, preaching G2784 (PresActPtc) and G2532 shewing the glad tidings G2097 (PresMidPtc) of the kingdom G0932 of God G2316: and G2532 the twelve G1427 [were] with G4862 him G0846,
008:002 And G2532 certain G5100 women G1135, which G3739 had been G2258 (ImpfInd) healed G2323 (PerfPasPtc) of G0575 evil G4190 spirits G4151 and G2532 infirmities G0769, Mary G3137 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Magdalene G3094, out of G0575 whom G3739 went G1831 (PlupfActInd) seven G2033 devils G1140,
008:003 And G2532 Joanna G2489 the wife G1135 of Chuza G5529 Herod’s G2264 steward G2012, and G2532 Susanna G4677, and G2532 many G4183 others G2087, which G3748 ministered G1247 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846 of G0575 their G0846 substance G5224 (PresActPtc).
008:004 And G1161 when much G4183 people G3793 were gathered together G4896 (PresPtc), and G2532 were come G1975 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G4314 him G0846 out of every G2596 city G4172, he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) by G1223 a parable G3850:
008:005 A sower G4687 (PresActPtc) went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) to sow G4687 (AorActInf) his G0846 seed G4703: and G2532 as G1722 he G0846 sowed G4687 (PresActInf), some G3739 G3303 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) by G3844 the way side G3598; and G2532 it was trodden down G2662 (AorPasInd), and G2532 the fowls G4071 of the air G3772 devoured G2719 (Aor2ActInd) it G0846.
008:006 And G2532 some G2087 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) upon G1909 a rock G4073; and G2532 as soon as it was sprung up G5453 (Aor2PasPtc), it withered away G3583 (AorPasInd), because G1223 it lacked G3361 G2192 (PresActInf) moisture G2429.
008:007 And G2532 some G2087 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) among G1722 G3319 thorns G0173; and G2532 the thorns G0173 sprang up with it G4855 (Aor2PasPtc), and choked G0638 (AorActInd) G1970 (AorActInd) it G0846.
008:008 And G2532 other G2087 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 good G0018 ground G1093, and G2532 sprang up G5453 (Aor2PasPtc), and bare G4160 (AorActInd) fruit G2590 an hundredfold G1542. And when he had said G3004 (PresActPtc) these things G5023, he cried G5455 (ImpfActInd), He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) ears G3775 to hear G0191 (PresActInf), let him hear G0191 (PresActImpr).
008:009 And G1161 his G0846 disciples G3101 asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 might G1498 this G3778 parable G3850 be G1498 (PresOpt)?
008:010 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Unto you G5213 it is given G1325 (PerfPasInd) to know G1097 (Aor2ActInf) the mysteries G3466 of the kingdom G0932 of God G2316: but G1161 to others G3062 in G1722 parables G3850; that G2443 seeing G0991 (PresActPtc) they might G0991 not G3361 see G0991 (PresActSubj), and G2532 hearing G0191 (PresActPtc) they might G4920 not G3361 understand G4920 (PresActSubj).
008:011 Now G1161 the parable G3850 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778: The seed G4703 is G2076 (PresInd) the word G3056 of God G2316.
008:012 Those G1161 by G3844 the way side G3598 are G1526 (PresInd) they that hear G0191 (PresActPtc); then G1534 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) the devil G1228, and G2532 taketh away G0142 (PresActInd) the word G3056 out of G0575 their G0846 hearts G2588, lest G3363 they should believe G4100 (AorActPtc) and be saved G4982 (AorPasSubj).
008:013 G1161 They on G1909 the rock G4073 [are they], which G3739, when G3752 they hear G0191 (AorActSubj), receive G1209 (PresMidPasDepInd) the word G3056 with G3326 joy G5479; and G2532 these G3778 have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 root G4491, which G3739 for G4314 a while G2540 believe G4100 (PresActInd), and G2532 in G1722 time G2540 of temptation G3986 fall away G0868 (PresMidPasDepInd).
008:014 And G1161 that which fell G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) among G1519 thorns G0173 are G1526 (PresInd) they G3778, which, when they have heard G0191 (AorActPtc), go forth G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and G2532 are choked G4846 (PresPasInd) with G5259 cares G3308 and G2532 riches G4149 and G2532 pleasures G2237 of [this] life G0979, and G2532 bring G5052 no G3756 fruit to perfection G5052 (PresActInd).
008:015 But G1161 that on G1722 the good G2570 ground G1093 are G1526 (PresInd) they G3778, which G3748 in G1722 an honest G2570 and G2532 good G0018 heart G2588, having heard G0191 (AorActPtc) the word G3056, keep G2722 (PresActInd) [it], and G2532 bring forth fruit G2592 (PresActInd) with G1722 patience G5281.
008:016 G1161 No man G3762, when he hath lighted G0681 (AorActPtc) a candle G3088, covereth G2572 (PresActInd) it G0846 with a vessel G4632, or G2228 putteth G5087 (PresActInd) [it] under G5270 a bed G2825; but G0235 setteth G2007 (PresActInd) [it] on G1909 a candlestick G3087, that G2443 they which enter in G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) may see G0991 (PresActSubj) the light G5457.
008:017 For G1063 nothing G3756 is G2076 (PresInd) secret G2927, that G3739 shall G1096 not G3756 be made G1096 (FutMidDepInd) manifest G5318; neither G3761 [any thing] hid G0614, that G3739 shall G1097 not G3756 be known G1097 (FutPasInd) and G2532 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) abroad G1519 G5318.
008:018 Take heed G0991 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767 how G4459 ye hear G0191 (PresActInd): for G1063 whosoever G3739 G0302 hath G2192 (PresActSubj), to him G0846 shall be given G1325 (FutPasInd); and G2532 whosoever G3739 G0302 hath G2192 (PresActSubj) not G3361, from G0575 him G0846 shall be taken G0142 (FutPasInd) even G2532 that which G3739 he seemeth G1380 (PresActInd) to have G2192 (PresActInf).
008:019 Then G1161 came G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd) to G4314 him G0846 [his] mother G3384 and G2532 his G0846 brethren G0080, and G2532 could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) not G3756 come G4940 (Aor2ActInf) at him G0846 for G1223 the press G3793.
008:020 And G2532 it was told G0518 (Aor2PasDepSubj) him G0846 [by certain] which said G3004 (PresActPtc), Thy G4675 mother G3384 and G2532 thy G4675 brethren G0080 stand G2476 (PerfActInd) without G1854, desiring G2309 (PresActPtc) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) thee G4571.
008:021 And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, My G3450 mother G3384 and G2532 my G3450 brethren G0080 are G1526 (PresInd) these G3778 which G3588 hear G0191 (PresActPtc) the word G3056 of God G2316, and G2532 do G4160 (PresActPtc) it G0846.
008:022 Now G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) on G1722 a certain G3391 day G2250, that G2532 he G0846 went G1684 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a ship G4143 with G2532 his G0846 disciples G3101: and G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Let us go over G1330 (Aor2ActSubj) unto G1519 the other side G4008 of the lake G3041. And G2532 they launched forth G0321 (AorPasInd).
008:023 But G1161 as they G0846 sailed G4126 (PresActPtc) he fell asleep G0879 (AorActInd): and G2532 there came down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) a storm G2978 of wind G0417 on G1519 the lake G3041; and G2532 they were filled G4845 (ImpfPasInd) [with water], and G2532 were in jeopardy G2793 (ImpfActInd).
008:024 And G1161 they came to him G4334 (Aor2ActPtc), and awoke G1326 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1988, master G1988, we perish G0622 (PresMidInd). Then G1161 he arose G1453 (AorPasPtc), and rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) the wind G0417 and G2532 the raging G2830 of the water G5204: and G2532 they ceased G3973 (AorMidInd), and G2532 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a calm G1055.
008:025 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Where G4226 is G2076 (PresInd) your G5216 faith G4102? And G1161 they being afraid G5399 (AorPasDepPtc) wondered G2296 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc) one to another G4314 G0240, What manner of man G5101 G0686 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778! for G3754 he commandeth G2004 (PresActInd) even G2532 the winds G0417 and G2532 water G5204, and G2532 they obey G5219 (PresActInd) him G0846.
008:026 And G2532 they arrived G2668 (AorActInd) at G1519 the country G5561 of the Gadarenes G1046, which G3748 is G2076 (PresInd) over against G0495 Galilee G1056.
008:027 And G1161 when he G0846 went forth G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1909 land G1093, there met G5221 (AorActInd) him G0846 out of G1537 the city G4172 a certain G5100 man G0435, which G3739 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) devils G1140 long G1537 G2425 time G5550, and G2532 ware G1737 (ImpfMidInd) no G3756 clothes G2440, neither G2532 G3756 abode G3306 (ImpfActInd) in G1722 [any] house G3614, but G0235 in G1722 the tombs G3418.
008:028 When G1161 he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) Jesus G2424, he cried out G0349 (AorActPtc), and G2532 fell down before G4363 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, and G2532 with a loud G3173 voice G5456 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 have I G1698 to do with G2532 thee G4671, Jesus G2424, [thou] Son G5207 of God G2316 most high G5310? I beseech G1189 (PresMidPasDepInd) thee G4675, torment G0928 (AorActSubj) me G3165 not G3361.
008:029 (For G1063 he had commanded G3853 (ImpfActInd) G3853 (AorActInd) the unclean G0169 spirit G4151 to come G1831 (Aor2ActInf) out of G0575 the man G0444. For G1063 oftentimes G4183 G5550 it had caught G4884 (PlupfActInd) him G0846: and G2532 he was kept G5442 (PresPasPtc) bound G1196 (ImpfPasInd) with chains G0254 and G2532 in fetters G3976; and G2532 he brake G1284 (PresActPtc) the bands G1199, and was driven G1643 (ImpfPasInd) of G5259 the devil G1142 into G1519 the wilderness G2048.)
008:030 And G1161 Jesus G2424 asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) thy G4671 name G3686? And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Legion G3003: because G3754 many G4183 devils G1140 were entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 him G0846.
008:031 And G2532 they besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that G3363 he would G2004 not G3363 command G2004 (AorActSubj) them G0846 to go out G0565 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the deep G0012.
008:032 And G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) there G1563 an herd G0034 of many G2425 swine G5519 feeding G1006 (PresPasPtc) on G1722 the mountain G3735: and G2532 they besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that G2443 he would suffer G2010 (AorActSubj) them G0846 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 them G1565. And G2532 he suffered G2010 (AorActInd) them G0846.
008:033 Then G1161 went G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) the devils G1140 out of G0575 the man G0444, and entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the swine G5519: and G2532 the herd G0034 ran G3729 (AorActInd) violently down G2596 a steep G2911 place into G1519 the lake G3041, and G2532 were choked G0638 (Aor2PasDepSubj).
008:034 When G1161 they that fed G1006 (PresActPtc) [them] saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) what was done G1096 (PerfPasPtc), they fled G5343 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and told G0518 (AorActInd) [it] in G1519 the city G4172 and G2532 in G1519 the country G0068.
008:035 Then G1161 they went out G1831 (Aor2ActInd) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) what was done G1096 (Perf2ActPtc); and G2532 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 Jesus G2424, and G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) the man G0444, out of G0575 whom G3739 the devils G1140 were departed G1831 (PlupfActInd), sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) at G3844 the feet G4228 of Jesus G2424, clothed G2439 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 in his right mind G4993 (PresActPtc): and G2532 they were afraid G5399 (AorPasDepInd).
008:036 G1161 They also G2532 which saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it] told G0518 (AorActInd) them G0846 by what means G4459 he that was possessed of the devils G1139 (AorPasDepPtc) was healed G4982 (AorPasInd).
008:037 Then G2532 the whole G0537 multitude G4128 of the country G4066 of the Gadarenes G1046 round about G4066 besought G2065 (AorActInd) him G0846 to depart G0565 (Aor2ActInf) from G0575 them G0846; for G3754 they were taken G4912 (ImpfPasInd) with great G3173 fear G5401: and G1161 he G0846 went up G1684 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the ship G4143, and returned back again G5290 (AorActInd).
008:038 Now G1161 the man G0435 out of G0575 whom G3739 the devils G1140 were departed G1831 (PlupfActInd) besought G1189 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) him G0846 that he might be G1511 (PresInf) with G4862 him G0846: but G1161 Jesus G2424 sent G0630 him G0846 away G0630 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
008:039 Return G5290 (PresActImpr) to G1519 thine own G4675 house G3624, and G2532 shew G1334 (PresMidPasDepImpr) how great things G3745 God G2316 hath done G4160 (AorActInd) unto thee G4671. And G2532 he went his way G0565 (Aor2ActInd), and published G2784 (PresActPtc) throughout G2596 the whole G3650 city G4172 how great things G3745 Jesus G2424 had done G4160 (AorActInd) unto him G0846.
008:040 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, when G1722 Jesus G2424 was returned G5290 (AorActInf), the people G3793 [gladly] received G0588 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846: for G1063 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) all G3956 waiting for G4328 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
008:041 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) a man G0435 named G3739 G3686 Jairus G2383, and G2532 he G0846 was G5225 (ImpfActInd) a ruler G0758 of the synagogue G4864: and G2532 he fell down G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) at G3844 Jesus G2424 ’ feet G4228, and besought G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 that he would come G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 his G0846 house G3624:
008:042 For G3754 he G0846 had G2258 (ImpfInd) one only G3439 daughter G2364, about G5613 twelve G1427 years of age G2094, and G2532 she G3778 G0846 lay a dying G0599 (ImpfActInd). But G1161 as G1722 he G0846 went G5217 (PresActInf) the people G3793 thronged G4846 (ImpfActInd) him G0846.
008:043 And G2532 a woman G1135 having G5607 (PresPtc) G1722 an issue G4511 of blood G0129 twelve G1427 years G0575 G2094, which G3748 had spent G4321 (AorActPtc) all G3650 her living G0979 upon G1519 physicians G2395, neither G3756 could G2480 (AorActInd) be healed G2323 (AorPasInf) of G5259 any G3762,
008:044 Came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) behind G3693 [him], and touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) the border G2899 of his G0846 garment G2440: and G2532 immediately G3916 her G0846 issue G4511 of blood G0129 stanched G2476 (Aor2ActInd).
008:045 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Who G5101 touched G0680 (AorMidPtc) me G3450? When G1161 all G3956 denied G0720 (PresMidPasDepPtc), Peter G4074 and G2532 they that were with G3326 him G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Master G1988, the multitude G3793 throng G4912 (PresActInd) thee G4571 and G2532 press G0598 (PresActInd) [thee], and G2532 sayest G3004 (PresActInd) thou, Who G5101 touched G0680 (AorMidPtc) me G3450?
008:046 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Somebody G5100 hath touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) me G3450: for G1063 I G1473 perceive G1097 (Aor2ActInd) that virtue G1411 is gone G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out of G0575 me G1700.
008:047 And G1161 when the woman G1135 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 she was G2990 not G3756 hid G2990 (Aor2ActInd), she came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) trembling G5141 (PresActPtc), and G2532 falling down before G4363 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, she declared G0518 (AorActInd) unto him G0846 before G1799 all G3956 the people G2992 for G1223 what G3739 cause G0156 she had touched G0680 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, and G2532 how G5613 she was healed G2390 (AorPasInd) immediately G3916.
008:048 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Daughter G2364, be of good comfort G2293 (PresActImpr): thy G4675 faith G4102 hath made G4982 thee G4571 whole G4982 (PerfActInd); go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) in G1519 peace G1515.
008:049 While he G0846 yet G2089 spake G2980 (PresActPtc), there cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) one G5100 from G3844 the ruler of the synagogue’s G0752 [house], saying G3004 (PresActPtc) to him G0846, G3754 Thy G4675 daughter G2364 is dead G2348 (PerfActInd); trouble G4660 (PresActImpr) not G3361 the Master G1320.
008:050 But G1161 when Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], he answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361: believe G4100 (PresActImpr) only G3440, and G2532 she shall be made whole G4982 (FutPasInd).
008:051 And G1161 when he came G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the house G3614, he suffered G0863 (AorActInd) no G3756 man G3762 to go in G1525 (Aor2ActInf), save G1508 Peter G4074, and G2532 James G2385, and G2532 John G2491, and G2532 the father G3962 and G2532 the mother G3384 of the maiden G3816.
008:052 And G1161 all G3956 wept G2799 (ImpfActInd), and G2532 bewailed G2875 (ImpfMidInd) her G0846: but G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Weep G2799 (PresActImpr) not G3361; she is G0599 not G3756 dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd), but G0235 sleepeth G2518 (PresActInd).
008:053 And G2532 they laughed G2606 him G0846 to scorn G2606 (ImpfActInd), knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) that G3754 she was dead G0599 (Aor2ActInd).
008:054 And G1161 he G0846 put G1544 (Aor2ActPtc) them all G3956 out G1854, and G2532 took G2902 (AorActPtc) her G0846 by the hand G5495, and called G5455 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Maid G3816, arise G1453 (PresMidPasImpr).
008:055 And G2532 her G0846 spirit G4151 came again G1994 (AorActInd), and G2532 she arose G0450 (Aor2ActInd) straightway G3916: and G2532 he commanded G1299 (AorActInd) to give G1325 (AorPasInf) her G0846 meat G5315 (Aor2ActInf).
008:056 And G2532 her G0846 parents G1118 were astonished G1839 (Aor2ActInd): but G1161 he charged G3853 (AorActInd) them G0846 that they should tell G2036 (Aor2ActInf) no man G3367 what was done G1096 (Perf2ActPtc).
009:001 ¶  Then G1161 he called G4779 his G0846 twelve G1427 disciples G3101 together G4779 (AorMidPtc), and G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) them G0846 power G1411 and authority G1849 over G1909 all G3956 devils G1140, and G2532 to cure G2323 (PresActInf) diseases G3554.
009:002 And G2532 he sent G0649 (AorActInd) them G0846 to preach G2784 (PresActInf) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, and G2532 to heal G2390 (PresMidPasDepInf) the sick G0770 (PresActPtc).
009:003 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Take G0142 (PresActImpr) nothing G3367 for G1519 [your] journey G3598, neither G3383 staves G4464, nor G3383 scrip G4082, neither G3383 bread G0740, neither G3383 money G0694; neither G3383 have G2192 (PresActInf) two G1417 coats G5509 apiece G0303.
009:004 And G2532 whatsoever G3739 G0302 house G3614 ye enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519, there G1563 abide G3306 (PresActImpr), and G2532 thence G1564 depart G1831 (PresMidPasDepImpr).
009:005 And G2532 whosoever G3745 G0302 will G1209 not G3361 receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) you G5209, when ye go G1831 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G0575 that G1565 city G4172, shake off G0660 (AorActImpr) the very G2532 dust G2868 from G0575 your G5216 feet G4228 for G1519 a testimony G3142 against G1909 them G0846.
009:006 And G1161 they departed G1831 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and went G1330 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) through G2596 the towns G2968, preaching the gospel G2097 (PresMidPtc), and G2532 healing G2323 (PresActPtc) every where G3837.
009:007 Now G1161 Herod G2264 the tetrarch G5076 heard G0191 (AorActInd) of all G3956 that was done G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) by G5259 him G0846: and G2532 he was perplexed G1280 (ImpfActInd), because G1223 that it was said G3004 (PresPasInf) of G5259 some G5100, that G3754 John G2491 was risen G1453 (PerfPasInd) from G1537 the dead G3498;
009:008 And G1161 of G5259 some G5100, that G3754 Elias G2243 had appeared G5316 (Aor2PasDepSubj); and G1161 of others G0243, that G3754 one G1520 of the old G0744 prophets G4396 was risen again G0450 (Aor2ActInd).
009:009 And G2532 Herod G2264 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), John G2491 have G0607 I G1473 beheaded G0607 (AorActInd): but G1161 who G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) this G3778, of G4012 whom G3739 I G1473 hear G0191 (PresActInd) such things G5108? And G2532 he desired G2212 (ImpfActInd) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846.
009:010 And G2532 the apostles G0652, when they were returned G5290 (AorActPtc), told G1334 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846 all that G3745 they had done G4160 (AorActInd). And G2532 he took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) them G0846, and went aside G5298 (AorActInd) privately G2596 G2398 into G1519 a desert G2048 place G5117 belonging to the city G4172 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Bethsaida G0966.
009:011 And G1161 the people G3793, when they knew G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846: and G2532 he received G1209 (AorMidDepPtc) them G0846, and spake G2980 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846 of G4012 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, and G2532 healed G2390 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) them that had G2192 (PresActPtc) need G5532 of healing G2322.
009:012 And G1161 when the day G2250 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to wear away G2827 (PresActInf), then G1161 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) the twelve G1427, and said G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto him G0846, Send G0630 the multitude G3793 away G0630 (AorActImpr), that G2443 they may go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the towns G2968 and G2532 country G0068 round about G2945, and lodge G2647 (AorActSubj), and G2532 get G2147 (Aor2ActInd) victuals G1979: for G3754 we are G2070 (PresInd) here G5602 in G1722 a desert G2048 place G5117.
009:013 But G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) ye G5210 them G0846 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf). And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), We G2254 have no G3756 G1526 (PresInd) more G4119 but G2228 five G4002 loaves G0740 and G2532 two G1417 fishes G2486; except G1509 we G2249 should go G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) and buy G0059 (AorActSubj) meat G1033 for G1519 all G3956 this G5126 people G2992.
009:014 For G1063 they were G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5616 five thousand G4000 men G0435. And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 his G0846 disciples G3101, Make G2625 them G0846 sit down G2625 (AorActImpr) by G0303 fifties G4004 in a company G2828.
009:015 And G2532 they did G4160 (AorActInd) so G3779, and G2532 made G0347 them all G0537 sit down G0347 (AorActInd).
009:016 Then G1161 he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the five G4002 loaves G0740 and G2532 the two G1417 fishes G2486, and looking up G0308 (AorActPtc) to G1519 heaven G3772, he blessed G2127 (AorActInd) them G0846, and G2532 brake G2622 (AorActInd), and G2532 gave G1325 (ImpfActInd) to the disciples G3101 to set before G3908 (AorPasInf) the multitude G3793.
009:017 And G2532 they did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 were G5526 all G3956 filled G5526 (AorPasInd): and G2532 there was taken up G0142 (AorPasInd) of fragments G2801 that remained G4052 (AorActPtc) to them G0846 twelve G1427 baskets G2894.
009:018 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G1722 he was G1511 (PresInf) alone G2651 praying G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc), his G0846 disciples G3101 were with G4895 (ImpfInd) him G0846: and G2532 he asked G1905 (AorActInd) them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Whom G5101 say G3004 (PresActInd) the people G3793 that I G3165 am G1511 (PresInf)?
009:019 They G1161 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), John G2491 the Baptist G0910; but G1161 some G0243 [say], Elias G2243; and G1161 others G0243 [say], that G3754 one G5100 of the old G0744 prophets G4396 is risen again G0450 (Aor2ActInd).
009:020 G1161 He said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, But G1161 whom G5101 say G3004 (PresActInd) ye G5210 that I G3165 am G1511 (PresInf)? G1161 Peter G4074 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), The Christ G5547 of God G2316.
009:021 And G1161 he straitly charged G2008 (AorActPtc) them G0846, and commanded G3853 (AorActInd) [them] to tell G2036 (Aor2ActInf) no man G3367 that thing G5124;
009:022 Saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), G3754 The Son G5207 of man G0444 must G1163 (PresInd) suffer G3958 (Aor2ActInf) many things G4183, and G2532 be rejected G0593 (AorPasInf) of G0575 the elders G4245 and G2532 chief priests G0749 and G2532 scribes G1122, and G2532 be slain G0615 (AorPasInf), and G2532 be raised G1453 (AorPasInf) the third G5154 day G2250.
009:023 And G1161 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) to G4314 [them] all G3956, If any [man] G1536 will G2309 (PresActInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf) after G3694 me G3450, let him deny G0533 (AorMidDepImpr) himself G1438, and G2532 take up G0142 (AorActImpr) his G0846 cross G4716 daily G2250 G2596, and G2532 follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
009:024 For G1063 whosoever G3739 G0302 will G2309 (PresActSubj) save G4982 (AorActInf) his G0846 life G5590 shall lose G0622 (FutActInd) it G0846: but G1161 whosoever G3739 G0302 will lose G0622 (AorActSubj) his G0846 life G5590 for my G1700 sake G1752, the same G3778 shall save G4982 (FutActInd) it G0846.
009:025 For G1063 what G5101 is G5623 a man G0444 advantaged G5623 (PresPasInd), if he gain G2770 (AorActPtc) the whole G3650 world G2889, and G1161 lose G0622 (AorActPtc) himself G1438, or G2228 be cast away G2210 (AorPasPtc)?
009:026 For G1063 whosoever G3739 G0302 shall be ashamed G1870 (AorPasDepSubj) of me G3165 and G2532 of my G1699 words G3056, of him G5126 shall G1870 the Son G5207 of man G0444 be ashamed G1870 (FutPasDepInd), when G3752 he shall come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 his own G0846 glory G1391, and G2532 [in his] Father’s G3962, and G2532 of the holy G0040 angels G0032.
009:027 But G1161 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213 of a truth G0230, there be G1526 (PresInd) some G5100 standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) here G5602, which G3739 shall G1089 not G3364 taste G1089 (FutMidDepInd) of death G2288, till G2193 G0302 they see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
009:028 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) about G5616 an eight G3638 days G2250 after G3326 these G5128 sayings G3056, G2532 he took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) Peter G4074 and G2532 John G2491 and G2532 James G2385, and went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a mountain G3735 to pray G4336 (AorMidDepInf).
009:029 And G2532 as G1722 he G0846 prayed G4336 (PresMidPasDepInf), the fashion G1491 of his G0846 countenance G4383 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) altered G2087, and G2532 his G0846 raiment G2441 [was] white G3022 [and] glistering G1823 (PresActPtc).
009:030 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there talked G4814 (ImpfActInd) with him G0846 two G1417 men G0435, which G3748 were G2258 (ImpfInd) Moses G3475 and G2532 Elias G2243:
009:031 Who G3739 appeared G3700 (AorPasPtc) in G1722 glory G1391, and spake G3004 (ImpfActInd) of his G0846 decease G1841 which G3739 he should G3195 (ImpfActInd) accomplish G4137 (PresActInf) at G1722 Jerusalem G2419.
009:032 But G1161 Peter G4074 and G2532 they that were with G4862 him G0846 were G2258 (ImpfInd) heavy G0916 (PerfPasPtc) with sleep G5258: and G1161 when they were awake G1235 (AorActPtc), they saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 glory G1391, and G2532 the two G1417 men G0435 that stood with G4921 (PerfActPtc) him G0846.
009:033 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G1722 they G0846 departed G1316 (PresMidPasDepInf) from G0575 him G0846, Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 Jesus G2424, Master G1988, it is G2076 (PresInd) good G2570 for us G2248 to be G1511 (PresInf) here G5602: and G2532 let us make G4160 (AorActSubj) three G5140 tabernacles G4633; one for G3391 thee G4671, and G2532 one for G3391 Moses G3475, and G2532 one for G3391 Elias G2243: not G3361 knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) what G3739 he said G3004 (PresActInd).
009:034 While G1161 he G0846 thus G5023 spake G3004 (PresActPtc), there came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a cloud G3507, and G2532 overshadowed G1982 (AorActInd) them G0846: and G1161 they feared G5399 (AorPasDepInd) as G1722 they G1565 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the cloud G3507.
009:035 And G2532 there came G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a voice G5456 out of G1537 the cloud G3507, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 beloved G0027 Son G5207: hear G0191 (PresActImpr) him G0846.
009:036 And G2532 when the voice G5456 was past G1722 G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf), Jesus G2424 was found G2147 (AorPasInd) alone G3441. And G2532 they G0846 kept [it] close G4601 (AorActInd), and G2532 told G0518 (AorActInd) no man G3762 in G1722 those G1565 days G2250 any G3762 of those things which G3739 they had seen G3708 (PerfActInd).
009:037 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that on G1722 the next G1836 day G2250, when they G0846 were come down G2718 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 the hill G3735, much G4183 people G3793 met G4876 (AorActInd) him G0846.
009:038 And, G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a man G0435 of G0575 the company G3793 cried out G0310 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, I beseech G1189 (PresMidPasDepInd) thee G4675, look G1914 (AorActImpr) upon G1909 my G3450 son G5207: for G3754 he is G2076 (PresInd) mine G3427 only child G3439.
009:039 And G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a spirit G4151 taketh G2983 (PresActInd) him G0846, and G2532 he suddenly G1810 crieth out G2896 (PresActInd); and G2532 it teareth G4682 (PresActInd) him G0846 that he foameth G0876 again G3326, and G2532 bruising G4937 (PresActPtc) him G0846 hardly G3425 departeth G0672 (PresActInd) from G0575 him G0846.
009:040 And G2532 I besought G1189 (AorPasInd) thy G4675 disciples G3101 to G2443 cast G1544 him G0846 out G1544 (PresActSubj); and G2532 they could G1410 (AorPasDepInd) not G3756.
009:041 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), O G5599 faithless G0571 and G2532 perverse G1294 (PerfPasPtc) generation G1074, how G2193 long G4219 shall I be G2071 (FutInd) with G4314 you G5209, and G2532 suffer G0430 (FutMidDepInd) you G5216? Bring G4317 (Aor2ActImpr) thy G4675 son G5207 hither G5602.
009:042 And G1161 as he G0846 was G4334 yet G2089 a coming G4334 (PresMidPasDepPtc), the devil G1140 threw G4486 him G0846 down G4486 (AorActInd), and G2532 tare G4952 (AorActInd) [him]. And G1161 Jesus G2424 rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) the unclean G0169 spirit G4151, and G2532 healed G2390 (AorMidDepInd) the child G3816, and G2532 delivered G0591 him G0846 again G0591 (AorActInd) to his G0846 father G3962.
009:043 And G1161 they were G1605 all G3956 amazed G1605 (ImpfPasInd) at G1909 the mighty power G3168 of God G2316. But G1161 while they wondered G2296 (PresActPtc) every one G3956 at G1909 all things G3956 which G3739 Jesus G2424 did G4160 (AorActInd), he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 his G0846 disciples G3101,
009:044 Let these G5128 sayings G3056 sink down G5087 (Aor2MidImpr) into G1519 your G5210 G5216 ears G3775: for G1063 the Son G5207 of man G0444 shall be G3195 (PresActInd) delivered G3860 (PresPasInf) into G1519 the hands G5495 of men G0444.
009:045 But G1161 they understood not G0050 (ImpfActInd) this G5124 saying G4487, and G2532 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) hid G3871 (PerfPasPtc) from G0575 them G0846, that G3363 they perceived G0143 (Aor2MidDepSubj) it G0846 not G3363: and G2532 they feared G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) to ask G2065 (AorActInf) him G0846 of G4012 that G5127 saying G4487.
009:046 Then G1161 there arose G1525 (Aor2ActInd) a reasoning G1261 among G1722 them G0846, which G5101 G0302 of them G0846 should be G1498 (PresOpt) greatest G3187.
009:047 And G1161 Jesus G2424, perceiving G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the thought G1261 of their G0846 heart G2588, took G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) a child G3813, and set G2476 (AorActInd) him G0846 by G3844 him G1438,
009:048 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Whosoever G3739 G1437 shall receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) this G5124 child G3813 in G1909 my G3450 name G3686 receiveth G1209 (PresMidPasDepInd) me G1691: and G2532 whosoever G3739 G1437 shall receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) me G1691 receiveth him G1209 (PresMidPasDepInd) that sent G0649 (AorActPtc) me G3165: for G1063 he that is G5225 (PresActPtc) least G3398 among G1722 you G5213 all G3956, the same G3778 shall be G2071 (FutInd) great G3173.
009:049 And G1161 John G2491 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Master G1988, we saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) one G5100 casting out G1544 (PresActPtc) devils G1140 in G1909 thy G4675 name G3686; and G2532 we forbad G2967 (AorActInd) him G0846, because G3754 he followeth G0190 (PresActInd) not G3756 with G3326 us G2257.
009:050 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Forbid G2967 (PresActImpr) [him] not G3361: for G1063 he G3739 that is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 against G2596 us G2257 is G2076 (PresInd) for G5228 us G2257.
009:051 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), when G1722 the time G2250 was come G4845 (PresPasInf) that he G0846 should be received up G0354, G2532 he G0846 stedfastly set G4741 (AorActInd) his G0846 face G4383 to go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419,
009:052 And G2532 sent G0649 (AorActInd) messengers G0032 before G4253 his G0846 face G4383: and G2532 they went G4198 (AorPasDepPtc), and entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a village G2968 of the Samaritans G4541, to G5620 make ready G2090 (AorActInf) for him G0846.
009:053 And G2532 they did G1209 not G3756 receive G1209 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, because G3754 his G0846 face G4383 was G2258 (ImpfInd) as though he would go G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419.
009:054 And G1161 when his G0846 disciples G3101 James G2385 and G2532 John G2491 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [this], they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd) that we command G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) fire G4442 to come down G2597 (Aor2ActInf) from G0575 heaven G3772, and G2532 consume G0355 (AorActInf) them G0846, even G2532 as G5613 Elias G2243 did G4160 (AorActInd)?
009:055 But G1161 he turned G4762 (Aor2PasPtc), and rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) them G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Ye know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what manner G3634 of spirit G4151 ye G5210 are of G2075 (PresInd).
009:056 For G1063 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is G2064 not G3756 come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to destroy G0622 (AorActInf) men’s G0444 lives G5590, but G0235 to save G4982 (AorActInf) [them]. And G2532 they went G4198 (AorPasDepInd) to G1519 another G2087 village G2968.
009:057 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, as they G0846 went G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the way G3598, a certain G5100 [man] said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Lord G2962, I will follow G0190 (FutActInd) thee G4671 whithersoever G3699 G0302 thou goest G0565 (PresMidPasDepSubj).
009:058 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Foxes G0258 have G2192 (PresActInd) holes G5454, and G2532 birds G4071 of the air G3772 [have] nests G2682; but G1161 the Son G5207 of man G0444 hath G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 where G4226 to lay G2827 (PresActSubj) [his] head G2776.
009:059 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 another G2087, Follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427. But G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, suffer G2010 (AorActImpr) me G3427 first G4412 to go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) and bury G2290 (AorActInf) my G3450 father G3962.
009:060 G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Let G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) the dead G3498 bury G2290 (AorActInf) their G1438 dead G3498: but G1161 go G0565 (Aor2ActPtc) thou G4771 and preach G1229 (PresActImpr) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
009:061 And G1161 another G2087 also G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, I will follow G0190 (FutActInd) thee G4671; but G1161 let G2010 (AorActImpr) me G3427 first G4412 go bid them farewell G0657 (AorMidInf), which are at home at G1519 my G3450 house G3624.
009:062 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, No man G3762, having put G1911 (Aor2ActPtc) his G0846 hand G5495 to G1909 the plough G0723, and G2532 looking G0991 (PresActPtc) back G1519 G3694, is G2076 (PresInd) fit G2111 for G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
010:001 ¶  G1161 After G3326 these things G5023 the Lord G2962 appointed G0322 (AorActInd) other G2087 seventy G1440 also G2532, and G2532 sent G0649 (AorActInd) them G0846 two G0303 and two G1417 before G4253 his G0846 face G4383 into G1519 every G3956 city G4172 and G2532 place G5117, whither G3757 G3739 he himself G0846 would G3195 (ImpfActInd) come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInf).
010:002 Therefore G3767 said he G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, The harvest G2326 truly G3303 [is] great G4183, but G1161 the labourers G2040 [are] few G3641: pray ye G1189 (AorPasDepImpr) therefore G3767 the Lord G2962 of the harvest G2326, that G3704 he would send forth G1544 (PresActSubj) labourers G2040 into G1519 his G0846 harvest G2326.
010:003 Go your ways G5217 (PresActImpr): behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 send G0649 you G5209 forth G0649 (PresActInd) as G5613 lambs G0704 among G1722 G3319 wolves G3074.
010:004 Carry G0941 (PresActImpr) neither G3361 purse G0905, nor G3361 scrip G4082, nor G3366 shoes G5266: and G2532 salute G0782 (AorMidDepSubj) no man G3367 by G2596 the way G3598.
010:005 And G1161 into G1519 whatsoever G3739 G0302 house G3614 ye enter G1525 (PresMidPasDepSubj), first G4412 say G3004 (PresActImpr), Peace G1515 [be] to this G5129 house G3624.
010:006 And G2532 if G1437 G3303 the son G5207 of peace G1515 be G5600 (PresSubj) there G1563, your G5216 peace G1515 shall rest G1879 (FutMidDepInd) upon G1909 it G0846: if not G1490, it shall turn G0344 to G1909 you G5209 again G0344 (FutActInd).
010:007 And G1161 in G1722 the same G0846 house G3614 remain G3306 (PresActImpr), eating G2068 (PresActPtc) and G2532 drinking G4095 (PresActPtc) such things as G3844 they G0846 give G3844: for G1063 the labourer G2040 is G2076 (PresInd) worthy G0514 of his G0846 hire G3408. Go G3327 (PresActImpr) not G3361 from G1537 house G3614 to G1519 house G3614.
010:008 And G2532 into G1519 whatsoever G1161 G3739 G0302 city G4172 ye enter G1525 (PresMidPasDepSubj), and G2532 they receive G1209 (PresMidPasDepSubj) you G5209, eat such things G2068 (PresActImpr) as are set before G3908 (PresPasPtc) you G5213:
010:009 And G2532 heal G2323 (PresActImpr) the sick G0772 that are therein G1722 G0846, and G2532 say G3004 (PresActImpr) unto them G0846, The kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is come nigh G1448 (PerfActInd) unto G1909 you G5209.
010:010 But G1161 into G1519 whatsoever G3739 G0302 city G4172 ye enter G1525 (PresMidPasDepSubj), and G2532 they receive G1209 (PresMidPasDepSubj) you G5209 not G3361, go your ways out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the streets G4113 of the same G0846, and say G2036 (Aor2ActImpr),
010:011 Even G2532 the very dust G2868 of G1537 your G5216 city G4172, which G3588 cleaveth G2853 (AorPasPtc) on us G2254, we do wipe off G0631 (PresMidInd) against you G5213: notwithstanding G4133 be ye sure G1097 (PresActImpr) of this G5124, that G3754 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is come nigh G1448 (PerfActInd) unto G1909 you G5209.
010:012 But G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 it shall be G2071 (FutInd) more tolerable G0414 in G1722 that G1565 day G2250 for Sodom G4670, than G2228 for that G1565 city G4172.
010:013 Woe G3759 unto thee G4671, Chorazin G5523! woe G3759 unto thee G4671, Bethsaida G0966! for G3754 if G1487 the mighty works G1411 had been done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 Tyre G5184 and G2532 Sidon G4605, which G3588 have been done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) in G1722 you G5213, they had G3340 a great while ago G3819 repented G3340 (AorActInd), sitting G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G0302 G1722 sackcloth G4526 and G2532 ashes G4700.
010:014 But G4133 it shall be G2071 (FutInd) more tolerable G0414 for Tyre G5184 and G2532 Sidon G4605 at G1722 the judgment G2920, than G2228 for you G5213.
010:015 And G2532 thou G4771, Capernaum G2584, which G3588 art exalted G5312 (AorPasPtc) to G2193 heaven G3772, shalt be thrust down G2601 (FutPasInd) to G2193 hell G0086.
010:016 He that heareth G0191 (PresActPtc) you G5216 heareth G0191 (PresActInd) me G1700; and G2532 he that despiseth G0114 (PresActPtc) you G5209 despiseth G0114 (PresActInd) me G1691; and G1161 he that despiseth G0114 (PresActPtc) me G1691 despiseth G0114 (PresActInd) him that sent G0649 (AorActPtc) me G3165.
010:017 And G1161 the seventy G1440 returned again G5290 (AorActInd) with G3326 joy G5479, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, even G2532 the devils G1140 are subject G5293 (PresPasInd) unto us G2254 through G1722 thy G4675 name G3686.
010:018 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, I beheld G2334 (ImpfActInd) Satan G4567 as G5613 lightning G0796 fall G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) from G1537 heaven G3772.
010:019 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I give G1325 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 power G1849 to tread G3961 (PresActInf) on G1883 serpents G3789 and G2532 scorpions G4651, and G2532 over G1909 all G3956 the power G1411 of the enemy G2190: and G2532 nothing G3762 shall G0091 by any means G3364 hurt G0091 (AorActSubj) G0091 (FutActInd) you G5209.
010:020 Notwithstanding G4133 in G1722 this G5129 rejoice G5463 (PresActImpr) not G3361, that G3754 the spirits G4151 are subject G5293 (PresPasInd) unto you G5213; but G1161 rather G3123 rejoice G5463 (PresActImpr), because G3754 your G5216 names G3686 are written G1125 (Aor2PasDepSubj) in G1722 heaven G3772.
010:021 In G1722 that G0846 hour G5610 Jesus G2424 rejoiced in G0021 (AorMidDepInd) spirit G4151, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I thank G1843 (PresMidInd) thee G4671, O Father G3962, Lord G2962 of heaven G3772 and G2532 earth G1093, that G3754 thou hast hid G0613 (AorActInd) these things G5023 from G0575 the wise G4680 and G2532 prudent G4908, and G2532 hast revealed G0601 (AorActInd) them G0846 unto babes G3516: even so G3483, Father G3962; for G3754 so G3779 it seemed G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) good G2107 in G1715 thy G4675 sight G1715.
010:022 All things G3956 are delivered G3860 (AorPasInd) to me G3427 of G5259 my G3450 Father G3962: and G2532 no man G3762 knoweth G1097 (PresActInd) who G5101 the Son G5207 is G2076 (PresInd), but G1508 the Father G3962; and G2532 who G5101 the Father G3962 is G2076 (PresInd), but G1508 the Son G5207, and G2532 [he] to whom G3739 G1437 the Son G5207 will G1014 (PresMidPasDepSubj) reveal G0601 (AorActInf) [him].
010:023 And G2532 he turned him G4762 (Aor2PasPtc) unto G4314 [his] disciples G3101, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) privately G2398 G2596, Blessed G3107 [are] the eyes G3788 which G3588 see G0991 (PresActPtc) the things that G3739 ye see G0991 (PresActInd):
010:024 For G1063 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213, that G3754 many G4183 prophets G4396 and G2532 kings G0935 have desired G2309 (AorActInd) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) those things which G3739 ye G5210 see G0991 (PresActInd), and G2532 have G1492 not G3756 seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd) [them]; and G2532 to hear G0191 (AorActInf) those things which G3739 ye hear G0191 (PresActInd), and G2532 have G0191 not G3756 heard G0191 (AorActInd) [them].
010:025 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a certain G5100 lawyer G3544 stood up G0450 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 tempted G1598 (PresActPtc) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, what G5101 shall I do G4160 (AorActPtc) to inherit G2816 (FutActInd) eternal G0166 life G2222?
010:026 G1161 He said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, What G5101 is written G1125 (PerfPasInd) in G1722 the law G3551? how G4459 readest thou G0314 (PresActInd)?
010:027 And G1161 he answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Thou shalt love G0025 (FutActInd) the Lord G2962 thy G4675 God G2316 with G1537 all G3650 thy G4675 heart G2588, and G2532 with G1537 all G3650 thy G4675 soul G5590, and G2532 with G1537 all G3650 thy G4675 strength G2479, and G2532 with G1537 all G3650 thy G4675 mind G1271; and G2532 thy G4675 neighbour G4139 as G5613 thyself G4572.
010:028 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Thou hast answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) right G3723: this G5124 do G4160 (PresActImpr), and G2532 thou shalt live G2198 (FutActInd).
010:029 But G1161 he, willing G2309 (PresActPtc) to justify G1344 (PresActInf) himself G1438, said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 Jesus G2424, And G2532 who G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 neighbour G4139?
010:030 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answering G5274 (Aor2ActPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), A certain G5100 [man] G0444 went down G2597 (ImpfActInd) from G0575 Jerusalem G2419 to G1519 Jericho G2410, and G2532 fell among G4045 (Aor2ActInd) thieves G3027, which G3739 G2532 stripped G1562 him G0846 of his raiment G1562 (AorActPtc), and G2532 wounded G4127 G2007 (Aor2ActPtc) [him], and departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd), leaving G0863 (Aor2ActPtc) [him] half dead G2253 G5177 (PresActPtc).
010:031 And G1161 by G2596 chance G4795 there came down G2597 (ImpfActInd) a certain G5100 priest G2409 that G1722 G1565 way G3598: and G2532 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, he passed by on the other side G0492 (Aor2ActInd).
010:032 And G1161 likewise G3668 G2532 a Levite G3019, when he was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) at G2596 the place G5117, came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and G2532 looked G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [on him], and passed by on the other side G0492 (Aor2ActInd).
010:033 But G1161 a certain G5100 Samaritan G4541, as he journeyed G3593 (PresActPtc), came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) where G2596 he was G0846: and G2532 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, he had compassion G4697 (AorPasDepInd) [on him],
010:034 And G2532 went G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) to [him], and bound up G2611 (AorActInd) his G0846 wounds G5134, pouring in G2022 (PresActPtc) oil G1637 and G2532 wine G3631, and G1161 set G1913 (AorActPtc) him G0846 on G1909 his own G2398 beast G2934, and brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 to G1519 an inn G3829, and G2532 took care G1959 (AorPasDepInd) of him G0846.
010:035 And G2532 on G1909 the morrow G0839 when he departed G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), he took out G1544 (Aor2ActPtc) two G1417 pence G1220, and gave G1325 (AorActInd) [them] to the host G3830, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Take care G1959 (AorPasImpr) of him G0846; and G2532 whatsoever G3748 G0302 thou spendest more G4325 (AorActSubj), when I G3165 come again G1722 G1880 (PresMidPasDepInf), I G1473 will repay G0591 (FutActInd) thee G4671.
010:036 Which G5101 now G3767 of these G5130 three G5140, thinkest G1380 (PresActInd) thou G4671, was G1096 (Perf2ActInf) neighbour G4139 unto him that fell G1706 (Aor2ActPtc) among G1519 the thieves G3027?
010:037 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), He that shewed G4160 (AorActPtc) mercy G1656 on G3326 him G0846. Then G3767 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Jesus G2424 unto him G0846, Go G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr), and G2532 do G4160 (PresActImpr) thou G4771 likewise G3668.
010:038 Now G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G1722 they G0846 went G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf), that G2532 he G0846 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 a certain G5100 village G2968: and G1161 a certain G5100 woman G1135 named G3686 Martha G3136 received G5264 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846 into G1519 her G0846 house G3624.
010:039 And G2532 she G3592 had G2258 (ImpfInd) a sister G0079 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Mary G3137, which G3739 also G2532 sat G3869 (AorActPtc) at G3844 Jesus G2424 ’ feet G4228, and heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 word G3056.
010:040 But G1161 Martha G3136 was cumbered G4049 (ImpfPasInd) about G4012 much G4183 serving G1248, and G1161 came to him G2186 (Aor2ActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, dost G3199 thou G4671 not G3756 care G3199 (PresActInd) that G3754 my G3450 sister G0079 hath left G2641 (Aor2ActInd) me G3165 to serve G1247 (PresActInf) alone G3441? bid G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) her G0846 therefore G3767 that G2443 she help G4878 (Aor2MidDepSubj) me G3427.
010:041 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Martha G3136, Martha G3136, thou art careful G3309 (PresActInd) and G2532 troubled G5182 (PresPasInd) about G4012 many things G4183:
010:042 But G1161 one thing G1520 is G2076 (PresInd) needful G5532: and G1161 Mary G3137 hath chosen G1586 (AorMidInd) that good G0018 part G3310, which G3748 shall G0851 not G3756 be taken away G0851 (FutPasInd) from G0575 her G0846.
011:001 ¶  And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, as G1722 he G0846 was G1511 (PresInf) praying G4336 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 a certain G5100 place G5117, when G5613 he ceased G3973 (AorMidInd), one G5100 of his G0846 disciples G3101 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Lord G2962, teach G1321 (AorActImpr) us G2248 to pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepInf), as G2531 John G2491 also G2532 taught G1321 (AorActInd) his G0846 disciples G3101.
011:002 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, When G3752 ye pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepSubj), say G3004 (PresActImpr), Our G2257 Father G3962 which G3588 art in G1722 heaven G3772, Hallowed be G0037 (AorPasImpr) thy G4675 name G3686. Thy G4675 kingdom G0932 come G2064 (Aor2ActImpr). Thy G4675 will G2307 be done G1096 (AorPasDepImpr), as G5613 in G1722 heaven G3772, so G2532 in G1909 earth G1093.
011:003 Give G1325 (PresActImpr) us G2254 day G2596 by day G2250 our G2257 daily G1967 bread G0740.
011:004 And G2532 forgive G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254 our G2257 sins G0266; for G1063 we G0846 also G2532 forgive G0863 (PresActInd) every one G3956 that is indebted G3784 (PresActPtc) to us G2254. And G2532 lead G1533 (AorActSubj) us G2248 not G3361 into G1519 temptation G3986; but G0235 deliver G4506 (AorMidDepImpr) us G2248 from G0575 evil G4190.
011:005 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Which G5101 of G1537 you G5216 shall have G2192 (FutActInd) a friend G5384, and G2532 shall go G4198 (FutMidDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846 at midnight G3317, and G2532 say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto him G0846, Friend G5384, lend G5531 (AorActImpr) me G3427 three G5140 loaves G0740;
011:006 For G1894 a friend G5384 of mine G3450 in G1537 his journey G3598 is come G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd) to G4314 me G3165, and G2532 I have G2192 (PresActInd) nothing G3756 G3739 to set before G3908 (FutActInd) him G0846?
011:007 And he G2548 from within G2081 shall answer G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), Trouble G2873 G3930 (PresActImpr) me G3427 not G3361: the door G2374 is G2808 now G2235 shut G2808 (PerfPasInd), and G2532 my G3450 children G3813 are G1526 (PresInd) with G3326 me G1700 in G1519 bed G2845; I cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) rise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) and give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) thee G4671.
011:008 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Though G1499 he will G1453 not G3756 rise G1453 (AorPasPtc) and give G1325 (FutActInd) him G0846, because G1223 he is G1511 (PresInf) his G0846 friend G5384, yet G1065 because G1223 of his G0846 importunity G0335 he will rise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) and give G1325 (FutActInd) him G0846 as many as G3745 he needeth G5535 (PresActInd).
011:009 And G2504 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Ask G0154 (PresActImpr), and G2532 it shall be given G1325 (FutPasInd) you G5213; seek G2212 (PresActImpr), and G2532 ye shall find G2147 (FutActInd); knock G2925 (PresActImpr), and G2532 it shall be opened G0455 (Fut2PasInd) unto you G5213.
011:010 For G1063 every one G3956 that asketh G0154 (PresActPtc) receiveth G2983 (PresActInd); and G2532 he that seeketh G2212 (PresActPtc) findeth G2147 (PresActInd); and G2532 to him that knocketh G2925 (PresActPtc) it shall be opened G0455 (Fut2PasInd).
011:011 If G1161 a son G5207 shall ask G0154 (FutActInd) bread G0740 of any of you G5216 that is a father G3962 G5101, will he give G1929 (FutActInd) G3361 him G0846 a stone G3037? or G1499 if [he ask] a fish G2486, will he G1929 for G0473 a fish G2486 give G1929 (FutActInd) G3361 him G0846 a serpent G3789?
011:012 Or G2228 G2532 if G1437 he shall ask G0154 (AorActSubj) an egg G5609, will he offer G3361 G1929 (FutActInd) him G0846 a scorpion G4651?
011:013 If G1487 ye G5210 then G3767, being G5225 (PresActPtc) evil G4190, know G1492 (PerfActInd) how to give G1325 (PresActInf) good G0018 gifts G1390 unto your G5216 children G5043: how much G4214 more G3123 shall G1325 [your] heavenly G3772 Father G3962 G1537 give G1325 (FutActInd) the Holy G0040 Spirit G4151 to them that ask G0154 (PresActPtc) him G0846?
011:014 And G2532 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) casting out G1544 (PresActPtc) a devil G1140, and G2532 it G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) dumb G2974. And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), when the devil G1140 was gone out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), the dumb G2974 spake G2980 (AorActInd); and G2532 the people G3793 wondered G2296 (AorActInd).
011:015 But G1161 some G5100 of G1537 them G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), He casteth out G1544 (PresActInd) devils G1140 through G1722 Beelzebub G0954 the chief G0758 of the devils G1140.
011:016 And G1161 others G2087, tempting G3985 (PresActPtc) [him], sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) of G3844 him G0846 a sign G4592 from G1537 heaven G3772.
011:017 But G1161 he G0846, knowing G1492 (PerfActPtc) their G0846 thoughts G1270, said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Every G3956 kingdom G0932 divided G1266 (AorPasPtc) against G1909 itself G1438 is brought to desolation G2049 (PresPasInd); and G2532 a house G3624 [divided] against G1909 a house G3624 falleth G4098 (PresActInd).
011:018 If G1161 G1499 Satan G4567 also G1499 be divided G1266 (AorPasInd) against G1909 himself G1438, how G4459 shall G2476 his G0846 kingdom G0932 stand G2476 (FutPasInd)? because G3754 ye say G3004 (PresActInd) that I G3165 cast out G1544 (PresActInf) devils G1140 through G1722 Beelzebub G0954.
011:019 And G1161 if G1487 I G1473 by G1722 Beelzebub G0954 cast out G1544 (PresActInd) devils G1140, by G1722 whom G5101 do G1544 your G5216 sons G5207 cast [them] out G1544 (PresActInd)? therefore G1223 G5124 shall they G0846 be G2071 (FutInd) your G5216 judges G2923.
011:020 But G1161 if G1487 I with G1722 the finger G1147 of God G2316 cast out G1544 (PresActInd) devils G1140, no doubt G0686 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is come G5348 (AorActInd) upon G1909 you G5209.
011:021 When G3752 a strong man G2478 armed G2528 (PerfPasPtc) keepeth G5442 (PresActSubj) his G0833 palace G1438, his G0846 goods G5224 (PresActPtc) are G2076 (PresInd) in G1722 peace G1515:
011:022 But G1161 when G1875 a stronger G2478 than he G0846 shall come upon him G1904 (Aor2ActPtc), and overcome G3528 (AorActSubj) him G0846, he taketh G0142 (PresActInd) from him G0846 all his armour G3833 wherein G1909 G3739 he trusted G3982 (Plupf2ActInd), and G2532 divideth G1239 (PresActInd) his G0846 spoils G4661.
011:023 He that is G5607 (PresPtc) not G3361 with G3326 me G1700 is G2076 (PresInd) against G2596 me G1700: and G2532 he that gathereth G4863 (PresActPtc) not G3361 with G3326 me G1700 scattereth G4650 (PresActInd).
011:024 When G3752 the unclean G0169 spirit G4151 is gone G1831 (Aor2ActSubj) out of G0575 a man G0444, he walketh G1330 (PresMidPasDepInd) through G1223 dry G0504 places G5117, seeking G2212 (PresActPtc) rest G0372; and G2532 finding G2147 (PresActPtc) none G3361, he saith G3004 (PresActInd), I will return G5290 (FutActInd) unto G1519 my G3450 house G3624 whence G3606 I came out G1831 (Aor2ActInd).
011:025 And G2532 when he cometh G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), he findeth G2147 (PresActInd) [it] swept G4563 (PerfPasPtc) and G2532 garnished G2885 (PerfPasPtc).
011:026 Then G5119 goeth he G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd), and G2532 taketh G3880 (PresActInd) [to him] seven G2033 other G2087 spirits G4151 more wicked G4191 than himself G1438; and G2532 they enter in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc), and dwell G2730 (PresActInd) there G1563: and G2532 the last G2078 [state] of that G1565 man G0444 is G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) worse G5501 than the first G4413.
011:027 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G1722 he G0846 spake G3004 (PresActInf) these things G5023, a certain G5100 woman G1135 of G1537 the company G3793 lifted up G1869 (AorActPtc) her voice G5456, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Blessed G3107 [is] the womb G2836 that bare G0941 (AorActPtc) thee G4571, and G2532 the paps G3149 which G3739 thou hast sucked G2337 (AorActInd).
011:028 But G1161 he G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Yea rather G3304, blessed G3107 [are] they that hear G0191 (PresActPtc) the word G3056 of God G2316, and G2532 keep G5442 (PresActPtc) it G0846.
011:029 And G1161 when the people G3793 were gathered thick together G1865 (PresPasPtc), he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf), This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) an evil G4190 generation G1074: they seek G1934 (PresActInd) a sign G4592; and G2532 there shall G1325 no G3756 sign G4592 be given G1325 (FutPasInd) it G0846, but G1508 the sign G4592 of Jonas G2495 the prophet G4396.
011:030 For G1063 as G2531 Jonas G2495 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a sign G4592 unto the Ninevites G3536, so G3779 shall G2071 also G2532 the Son G5207 of man G0444 be G2071 (FutInd) to this G5026 generation G1074.
011:031 The queen G0938 of the south G3558 shall rise up G1453 (FutPasInd) in G1722 the judgment G2920 with G3326 the men G0435 of this G5026 generation G1074, and G2532 condemn G2632 (FutActInd) them G0846: for G3754 she came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) from G1537 the utmost parts G4009 of the earth G1093 to hear G0191 (AorActInf) the wisdom G4678 of Solomon G4672; and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a greater than G4119 Solomon G4672 [is] here G5602.
011:032 The men G0435 of Nineve G3535 shall rise up G0450 (FutMidInd) in G1722 the judgment G2920 with G3326 this G5026 generation G1074, and G2532 shall condemn G2632 (FutActInd) it G0846: for G3754 they repented G3340 (AorActInd) at G1519 the preaching G2782 of Jonas G2495; and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), a greater than G4119 Jonas G2495 [is] here G5602.
011:033 G1161 No man G3762, when he hath lighted G0681 (AorActPtc) a candle G3088, putteth G5087 (PresActInd) [it] in G1519 a secret place G2926, neither G3761 under G5259 a bushel G3426, but G0235 on G1909 a candlestick G3087, that G2443 they which G3588 come in G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) may see G0991 (PresActSubj) the light G5338.
011:034 The light G3088 of the body G4983 is G2076 (PresInd) the eye G3788: therefore G3767 when G1875 thine G4675 eye G3788 is G5600 (PresSubj) single G0573, thy G4675 whole G3650 body G4983 also G2532 is G2076 (PresInd) full of light G5460; but G1161 when G3752 [thine eye] is G5600 (PresSubj) evil G4190, thy G4675 body G4983 also G2532 [is] full of darkness G4652.
011:035 Take heed G4648 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767 that the light G5457 which G3588 is in G1722 thee G4671 be G2076 (PresInd) not G3361 darkness G4655.
011:036 If G1487 thy G4675 whole G3650 body G4983 therefore G3767 [be] full of light G5460, having G2192 (PresActPtc) no G3361 G5100 part G3313 dark G4652, the whole G3650 shall be G2071 (FutInd) full of light G5460, as G5613 when G3752 the bright shining G0796 of a candle G3088 doth give G5461 thee G4571 light G5461 (PresActSubj).
011:037 And G1161 as G1722 he spake G2980 (AorActInf), a certain G5100 Pharisee G5330 besought G2065 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 to G3704 dine G0709 (AorActSubj) with G3844 him G0846: and G1161 he went in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc), and sat down to meat G0377 (Aor2ActInd).
011:038 And G1161 when the Pharisee G5330 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he marvelled G2296 (AorActInd) that G3754 he had G0907 not G3756 first G4412 washed G0907 (AorPasInd) before G4253 dinner G0712.
011:039 And G1161 the Lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Now G3568 do G2511 ye G5210 Pharisees G5330 make clean G2511 (PresActInd) the outside G1855 of the cup G4221 and G2532 the platter G4094; but G1161 your G5216 inward part G2081 is full G1073 (PresActInd) of ravening G0724 and G2532 wickedness G4189.
011:040 [Ye] fools G0878, did G4160 not G3756 he that made G4160 (AorActPtc) that which G3588 is without G1855 make G4160 (AorActInd) that which G3588 is within G2081 also G2532?
011:041 But rather G4133 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) alms G1654 of such things as ye have G1751 (PresPtc); and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), all things G3956 are G2076 (PresInd) clean G2513 unto you G5213.
011:042 But G0235 woe G3759 unto you G5213, Pharisees G5330! for G3754 ye tithe G0586 (PresActInd) mint G2238 and G2532 rue G4076 and G2532 all manner G3956 of herbs G3001, and G2532 pass over G3928 (PresMidPasDepInd) judgment G2920 and G2532 the love G0026 of God G2316: these G5023 ought ye G1163 (ImpfInd) to have done G4160 (AorActInf), and not G3361 to leave G0863 the other G2548 undone G0863 (PresActInf).
011:043 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, Pharisees G5330! for G3754 ye love G0025 (PresActInd) the uppermost seats G4410 in G1722 the synagogues G4864, and G2532 greetings G0783 in G1722 the markets G0058.
011:044 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, scribes G1122 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, hypocrites G5273! for G3754 ye are G2075 (PresInd) as G5613 graves G3419 which G3588 appear not G0082, and G2532 the men G0444 that walk G4043 (PresActPtc) over G1883 [them] are G1492 not G3756 aware G1492 (PerfActInd) [of them].
011:045 Then G1161 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) one G5100 of the lawyers G3544, and said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Master G1320, thus G5023 saying G3004 (PresActPtc) thou reproachest G5195 (PresActInd) us G2248 also G2532.
011:046 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Woe G3759 unto you G5213 also G2532, [ye] lawyers G3544! for G3754 ye lade G5412 (PresActInd) men G0444 with burdens G5413 grievous to be borne G1419, and G2532 ye yourselves G0846 touch G4379 (PresActInd) not G3756 the burdens G5413 with one G1520 of your G5216 fingers G1147.
011:047 Woe G3759 unto you G5213! for G3754 ye build G3618 (PresActInd) the sepulchres G3419 of the prophets G4396, and G1161 your G5216 fathers G3962 killed G0615 (AorActInd) them G0846.
011:048 Truly G0686 ye bear witness G3140 (PresActInd) that G2532 ye allow G4909 (PresActInd) the deeds G2041 of your G5216 fathers G3962: for G3754 they G0846 indeed G3303 killed G0615 (AorActInd) them G0846, and G1161 ye G5210 build G3618 (PresActInd) their G0846 sepulchres G3419.
011:049 Therefore G1223 G5124 also G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the wisdom G4678 of God G2316, I will send G0649 (FutActInd) G1519 them G0846 prophets G4396 and G2532 apostles G0652, and G2532 [some] of G1537 them G0846 they shall slay G0615 (FutActInd) and G2532 persecute G1559 (FutActInd):
011:050 That G2443 the blood G0129 of all G3956 the prophets G4396, which G3588 was shed G1632 (PresPasPtc) from G0575 the foundation G2602 of the world G2889, may be required G1567 (AorPasSubj) of G0575 this G5026 generation G1074;
011:051 From G0575 the blood G0129 of Abel G0006 unto G2193 the blood G0129 of Zacharias G2197, which G3588 perished G0622 (Aor2MidPtc) between G3342 the altar G2379 and G2532 the temple G3624: verily G3483 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, It shall be required G1567 (FutPasInd) of G0575 this G5026 generation G1074.
011:052 Woe G3759 unto you G5213, lawyers G3544! for G3754 ye have taken away G0142 (AorActInd) the key G2807 of knowledge G1108: ye entered G1525 not G3756 in G1525 (Aor2ActInd) yourselves G0846, and G2532 them that were entering in G1525 (PresMidPasDepPtc) ye hindered G2967 (AorActInd).
011:053 And G1161 as he G0846 said G3004 (PresActPtc) these things G5023 unto G4314 them G0846, the scribes G1122 and G2532 the Pharisees G5330 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to urge G1758 (PresActInf) [him] vehemently G1171, and G2532 to provoke G0653 him G0846 to speak G0653 (PresActInf) of G4012 many things G4119:
011:054 Laying wait for G1748 (PresActPtc) him G0846, and G2532 seeking G2212 (PresActPtc) to catch G2340 (AorActInf) something G5100 out of G1537 his G0846 mouth G4750, that G2443 they might accuse G2723 (AorActSubj) him G0846.
012:001 ¶  In G1722 the mean time G3739, when there were gathered together G1996 (AorPasPtc) an innumerable multitude G3461 of people G3793, insomuch that G5620 they trode G2662 (PresActInf) one upon another G0240, he began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf) unto G4314 his G0846 disciples G3101 first of all G4412, Beware G4337 (PresActImpr) ye G1438 of G0575 the leaven G2219 of the Pharisees G5330, which G3748 is G2076 (PresInd) hypocrisy G5272.
012:002 For G1161 there is G2076 (PresInd) nothing G3762 covered G4780 (PerfPasPtc), that G3739 shall G0601 not G3756 be revealed G0601 (FutPasInd); neither G2532 hid G2927, that G3739 shall G1097 not G3756 be known G1097 (FutPasInd).
012:003 Therefore G0473 G3739 whatsoever G3745 ye have spoken G2036 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 darkness G4653 shall be heard G0191 (FutPasInd) in G1722 the light G5457; and G2532 that which G3739 ye have spoken G2980 (AorActInd) in G4314 the ear G3775 in G1722 closets G5009 shall be proclaimed G2784 (FutPasInd) upon G1909 the housetops G1430.
012:004 And G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213 my G3450 friends G5384, Be G5399 not G3361 afraid G5399 (AorPasDepImpr) of them G0575 that kill G0615 (PresActPtc) the body G4983, and G2532 after G3326 that G5023 have G2192 (PresActPtc) no G3361 G5100 more G4055 that they can do G4160 (AorActInf).
012:005 But G1161 I will forewarn G5263 (FutActInd) you G5213 whom G5101 ye shall fear G5399 (AorPasDepSubj): Fear G5399 (AorPasDepImpr) him, which after G3326 he hath killed G0615 (AorActInf) hath G2192 (PresActPtc) power G1849 to cast G1685 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 hell G1067; yea G3483, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Fear G5399 (AorPasDepImpr) him G5126.
012:006 Are G4453 not G3780 five G4002 sparrows G4765 sold G4453 (PresPasInd) for two G1417 farthings G0787, and G2532 not G3756 one G1520 of G1537 them G0846 is G2076 (PresInd) forgotten G1950 (PerfPasPtc) before G1799 God G2316?
012:007 But G0235 even the very G2532 hairs G2359 of your G5216 head G2776 are G0705 all G3956 numbered G0705 (PerfPasInd). Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361 therefore G3767: ye are of more value G1308 (PresActInd) than many G4183 sparrows G4765.
012:008 Also G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Whosoever G3956 G3739 G0302 shall confess G3670 (AorActSubj) G1722 me G1698 before G1715 men G0444, G1722 him G0846 shall G3670 the Son G5207 of man G0444 also G2532 confess G3670 (FutActInd) before G1715 the angels G0032 of God G2316:
012:009 But G1161 he that denieth G0720 (AorMidDepPtc) me G3165 before G1799 men G0444 shall be denied G0533 (FutPasInd) before G1799 the angels G0032 of God G2316.
012:010 And G2532 whosoever G3956 G3739 shall speak G2046 (FutActInd) a word G3056 against G1519 the Son G5207 of man G0444, it shall be forgiven G0863 (FutPasInd) him G0846: but G1161 unto him that blasphemeth G0987 (AorActPtc) against G1519 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 it shall G0863 not G3756 be forgiven G0863 (FutPasInd).
012:011 And G1161 when G3752 they bring G4374 (PresActSubj) you G5209 unto G1909 the synagogues G4864, and G2532 [unto] magistrates G0746, and G2532 powers G1849, take G3309 ye no G3361 thought G3309 (PresActImpr) how G4459 or G2228 what thing G5101 ye shall answer G0626 (AorMidDepSubj), or G2228 what G5101 ye shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj):
012:012 For G1063 the Holy G0040 Ghost G4151 shall teach G1321 (FutActInd) you G5209 in G1722 the same G0846 hour G5610 what G3739 ye ought G1163 (PresInd) to say G2036 (Aor2ActInf).
012:013 And G1161 one G5100 of G1537 the company G3793 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Master G1320, speak G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) to my G3450 brother G0080, that he divide G3307 (AorMidInf) the inheritance G2817 with G3326 me G1700.
012:014 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Man G0444, who G5101 made G2525 (AorActInd) me G3165 a judge G1348 or G2228 a divider G3312 over G1909 you G5209?
012:015 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Take heed G3708 (PresActImpr), and G2532 beware G5442 (PresMidImpr) of G0575 covetousness G4124: for G3754 a man’s G5100 G0846 life G2222 consisteth G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 in G1722 the abundance G4052 (PresActInf) of G1537 the things which he G0846 possesseth G5224 (PresActPtc).
012:016 And G1161 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) a parable G3850 unto G4314 them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), The ground G5561 of a certain G5100 rich G4145 man G0444 brought forth plentifully G2164 (AorActInd):
012:017 And G2532 he thought G1260 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) within G1722 himself G1438, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 shall I do G4160 (AorActSubj), because G3754 I have G2192 (PresActInd) no G3756 room where G4226 to bestow G4863 (FutActInd) my G3450 fruits G2590?
012:018 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), This G5124 will I do G4160 (FutActInd): I will pull down G2507 (FutActInd) my G3450 barns G0596, and G2532 build G3618 (FutActInd) greater G3187; and G2532 there G1563 will I bestow G4863 (FutActInd) all G3956 my G3450 fruits G1081 and G2532 my G3450 goods G0018.
012:019 And G2532 I will say G2046 (FutActInd) to my G3450 soul G5590, Soul G5590, thou hast G2192 (PresActInd) much G4183 goods G0018 laid up G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc) for G1519 many G4183 years G2094; take thine ease G0373 (PresMidImpr), eat G5315 (Aor2ActImpr), drink G4095 (Aor2ActImpr), [and] be merry G2165 (PresPasImpr).
012:020 But G1161 God G2316 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, [Thou] fool G0878, this G5026 night G3571 thy G4675 soul G5590 shall be required G0523 (PresActInd) of G0575 thee G4675: then G1161 whose G5101 shall those things be G2071 (FutInd), which G3739 thou hast provided G2090 (AorActInd)?
012:021 So G3779 [is] he that layeth up treasure G2343 (PresActPtc) for himself G1438, and G2532 is G4147 not G3361 rich G4147 (PresActPtc) toward G1519 God G2316.
012:022 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 his G0846 disciples G3101, Therefore G1223 G5124 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Take G3309 no G3361 thought G3309 (PresActImpr) for your G5216 life G5590, what G5101 ye shall eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj); neither G3366 for the body G4983, what G5101 ye shall put on G1746 (AorMidSubj).
012:023 The life G5590 is G2076 (PresInd) more G4119 than meat G5160, and G2532 the body G4983 [is more] than raiment G1742.
012:024 Consider G2657 (AorActImpr) the ravens G2876: for G3754 they neither G3756 sow G4687 (PresActInd) nor G3761 reap G2325 (PresActInd); which G3739 neither G3756 have G2076 (PresInd) storehouse G5009 nor G3761 barn G0596; and G2532 God G2316 feedeth G5142 (PresActInd) them G0846: how much G4214 more G3123 are G1308 ye G5210 better than G1308 (PresActInd) the fowls G4071?
012:025 And G1161 which G5101 of G1537 you G5216 with taking thought G3309 (PresActPtc) can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) add G4369 (Aor2ActInf) to G1909 his G0846 stature G2244 one G1520 cubit G4083?
012:026 If G1487 ye then G3767 be G1410 not G3777 able to do G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) that thing which is least G1646, why G5101 take ye thought G3309 (PresActInd) for G4012 the rest G3062?
012:027 Consider G2657 (AorActImpr) the lilies G2918 how G4459 they grow G0837 (PresActInd): they toil G2872 (PresActInd) not G3756, they spin G3514 (PresActInd) not G3761; and yet G1161 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that Solomon G4672 in G1722 all G3956 his G0846 glory G1391 was G4016 not G3761 arrayed G4016 (Aor2MidInd) like G5613 one G1520 of these G5130.
012:028 If G1487 then G1161 God G2316 so G3779 clothe G0294 (PresActInd) the grass G5528, which G5607 (PresPtc) is to day G4594 in G1722 the field G0068, and G2532 to morrow G0839 is cast G0906 (PresPasPtc) into G1519 the oven G2823; how much G4214 more G3123 [will he clothe] you G5209, O ye of little faith G3640?
012:029 And G2532 seek G2212 (PresActImpr) not G3361 ye G5210 what G5101 ye shall eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj), or G2228 what G5101 ye shall drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj), G2532 neither G3361 be ye of doubtful mind G3349 (PresPasImpr).
012:030 For G1063 all G3956 these things G5023 do G1934 the nations G1484 of the world G2889 seek after G1934 (PresActInd): and G1161 your G5216 Father G3962 knoweth G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 ye have need G5535 (PresActInd) of these things G5130.
012:031 But rather G4133 seek ye G2212 (PresActImpr) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316; and G2532 all G3956 these things G5023 shall be added G4369 (FutPasInd) unto you G5213.
012:032 Fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepImpr) not G3361, little G3398 flock G4168; for G3754 it is G2106 your G5216 Father’s G3962 good pleasure G2106 (AorActInd) to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) you G5213 the kingdom G0932.
012:033 Sell G4453 (AorActImpr) that ye G5216 have G5224 (PresActPtc), and G2532 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) alms G1654; provide G4160 (AorActImpr) yourselves G1438 bags G0905 which wax G3822 not G3361 old G3822 (PresPasPtc), a treasure G2344 in G1722 the heavens G3772 that faileth not G0413, where G3699 no G3756 thief G2812 approacheth G1448 (PresActInd), neither G3761 moth G4597 corrupteth G1311 (PresActInd).
012:034 For G1063 where G3699 your G5216 treasure G2344 is G2076 (PresInd), there G1563 will G2071 your G5216 heart G2588 be G2071 (FutInd) also G2532.
012:035 Let G2077 your G5216 loins G3751 be G2077 (PresImpr) girded about G4024 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 [your] lights G3088 burning G2545 (PresPasPtc);
012:036 And G2532 ye yourselves G5210 like G3664 unto men G0444 that wait G4327 (PresMidPasDepPtc) for their G1438 lord G2962, when G4219 he will return G0360 (FutActInd) from G1537 the wedding G1062; that G2443 when he cometh G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and G2532 knocketh G2925 (AorActPtc), they may open G0455 (AorActSubj) unto him G0846 immediately G2112.
012:037 Blessed G3107 [are] those G1565 servants G1401, whom G3739 the lord G2962 when he cometh G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) shall find G2147 (FutActInd) watching G1127 (PresActPtc): verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 he shall gird himself G4024 (FutMidInd), and G2532 make G0347 them G0846 to sit down to meat G0347 (FutActInd), and G2532 will come forth G3928 (Aor2ActPtc) and serve G1247 (FutActInd) them G0846.
012:038 And G2532 if G1437 he shall come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 the second G1208 watch G5438, or G2532 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 the third G5154 watch G5438, and G2532 find G2147 (Aor2ActSubj) [them] so G3779, blessed G3107 are G1526 (PresInd) those G1565 servants G1401.
012:039 And G1161 this G5124 know G1097 (PresActImpr), that G3754 if G1487 the goodman of the house G3617 had known G1492 (PlupfActInd) what G4169 hour G5610 the thief G2812 would come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), G0302 he would have watched G1127 (AorActInd), and G2532 G0302 not G3756 have suffered G0863 (AorActInd) his G0846 house G3624 to be broken through G1358 (Aor2PasInf).
012:040 Be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) ye G5210 therefore G3767 ready G2092 also G2532: for G3754 G3739 the Son G5207 of man G0444 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) at an hour G5610 when ye think G1380 (PresActInd) not G3756.
012:041 Then G1161 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, speakest thou G3004 (PresActInd) this G5026 parable G3850 unto G4314 us G2248, or G2228 even G2532 to G4314 all G3956?
012:042 And G1161 the Lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Who G5101 then G0686 is G2076 (PresInd) that faithful G4103 and G2532 wise G5429 steward G3623, whom G3739 [his] lord G2962 shall make ruler G2525 (FutActInd) over G1909 his G0846 household G2322, to give G1325 (PresActInf) [them their] portion of meat G4620 in G1722 due season G2540?
012:043 Blessed G3107 [is] that G1565 servant G1401, whom G3739 his G0846 lord G2962 when he cometh G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) shall find G2147 (FutActInd) so G3779 doing G4160 (PresActPtc).
012:044 Of a truth G0230 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 he will make him G0846 ruler G2525 (FutActInd) over G1909 all G3956 that he G0846 hath G5224 (PresActPtc).
012:045 But and G1161 if G1437 that G1565 servant G1401 say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) in G1722 his G0846 heart G2588, My G3450 lord G2962 delayeth G5549 (PresActInd) his coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepInf); and G2532 shall begin G0756 (AorMidSubj) to beat G5180 (PresActInf) the menservants G3816 and G2532 maidens G3814, and G5037 to eat G2068 (PresActInf) and G2532 drink G4095 (PresActInf), and G2532 to be drunken G3182 (PresPasInf);
012:046 The lord G2962 of that G1565 servant G1401 will come G2240 (FutActInd) in G1722 a day G2250 when G3739 he looketh G4328 not G3756 for G4328 (PresActInd) [him], and G2532 at G1722 an hour G5610 when G3739 he is G1097 not G3756 aware G1097 (PresActInd), and G2532 will cut G1371 him G0846 in sunder G1371 (FutActInd), and G2532 will appoint G5087 (FutActInd) him his G0846 portion G3313 with G3326 the unbelievers G0571.
012:047 And G1161 that G1565 servant G1401, which G3588 knew G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) his G1438 lord’s G2962 will G2307, and G2532 prepared G2090 (AorActPtc) not G3361 [himself], neither G3366 did G4160 (AorActPtc) according G4314 to his G0846 will G2307, shall be beaten G1194 (Fut2PasInd) with many G4183 [stripes].
012:048 But G1161 he that knew G1097 (Aor2ActPtc) not G3361, and G1161 did commit G4160 (AorActPtc) things worthy G0514 of stripes G4127, shall be beaten G1194 (Fut2PasInd) with few G3641 [stripes]. For G1161 unto whomsoever G3739 G3956 much G4183 is given G1325 (AorPasInd), of G3844 him G0846 shall be much G4183 required G2212 (FutPasInd): and G2532 to whom men G3739 have committed G3908 (Aor2MidInd) much G4183, of him G0846 they will ask G0154 (FutActInd) the more G4055.
012:049 I am come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to send G0906 (Aor2ActInf) fire G4442 on G1519 the earth G1093; and G2532 what G5101 will I G2309 (PresActInd), if G1487 it be G0381 already G2235 kindled G0381 (AorPasInd)?
012:050 But G1161 I have G2192 (PresActInd) a baptism G0908 to be baptized with G0907 (AorPasInf); and G2532 how G4459 am I straitened G4912 (PresPasInd) till G2193 G3739 it be accomplished G5055 (AorPasSubj)!
012:051 Suppose ye G1380 (PresActInd) that G3754 I am come G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd) to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) peace G1515 on G1722 earth G1093? I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213, Nay G3780; but G0235 rather G2228 division G1267:
012:052 For G1063 from G0575 henceforth G3568 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) five G4002 in G1722 one G1520 house G3624 divided G1266 (PerfPasPtc), three G5140 against G1909 two G1417, and G2532 two G1417 against G1909 three G5140.
012:053 The father G3962 shall be divided G1266 (FutPasInd) against G1909 the son G5207, and G2532 the son G5207 against G1909 the father G3962; the mother G3384 against G1909 the daughter G2364, and G2532 the daughter G2364 against G1909 the mother G3384; the mother in law G3994 against G1909 her G0846 daughter in law G3565, and G2532 the daughter in law G3565 against G1909 her G0846 mother in law G3994.
012:054 And G1161 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) also G2532 to the people G3793, When G3752 ye see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) a cloud G3507 rise G0393 (PresActPtc) out of G0575 the west G1424, straightway G2112 ye say G3004 (PresActInd), There cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) a shower G3655; and G2532 so G3779 it is G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd).
012:055 And G2532 when G3752 [ye see] the south wind G3558 blow G4154 (PresActPtc), ye say G3004 (PresActInd), G3754 There will be G2071 (FutInd) heat G2742; and G2532 it cometh to pass G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd).
012:056 [Ye] hypocrites G5273, ye can G1492 (PerfActInd) discern G1381 (PresActInf) the face G4383 of the sky G3772 and G2532 of the earth G1093; but G1161 how is it G4459 that ye do not G3756 discern G1381 (PresActInd) this G5126 time G2540?
012:057 Yea G1161, and why G5101 even G2532 of G0575 yourselves G1438 judge ye G2919 (PresActInd) not G3756 what is right G1342?
012:058 When G5613 G1063 thou goest G5217 (PresActInd) with G3326 thine G4675 adversary G0476 to G1909 the magistrate G0758, [as thou art] in G1722 the way G3598, give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) diligence G2039 that thou mayest be delivered G0525 (PerfPasInf) from G0575 him G0846; lest G3379 he hale G2694 (AorActSubj) thee G4571 to G4314 the judge G2923, and G2532 the judge G2923 deliver G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) thee G4571 to the officer G4233, and G2532 the officer G4233 cast G0906 (PresActSubj) thee G4571 into G1519 prison G5438.
012:059 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) thee G4671, thou shalt G1831 not G3364 depart G1831 (Aor2ActSubj) thence G1564, G2532 till G2193 G3739 thou hast paid G0591 (Aor2ActSubj) the very last G2078 mite G3016.
013:001 ¶  G1161 There were present G3918 (ImpfInd) at G1722 that season G0846 G2540 some G5100 that told G0518 (PresActPtc) him G0846 of G4012 the Galilaeans G1057, whose G3739 blood G0129 Pilate G4091 had mingled G3396 (AorActInd) with G3326 their G0846 sacrifices G2378.
013:002 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Suppose ye G1380 (PresActInd) that G3754 these G3778 Galilaeans G1057 were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) sinners G0268 above G3844 all G3956 the Galilaeans G1057, because G3754 they suffered G3958 (Perf2ActInd) such things G5108?
013:003 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213, Nay G3780: but G0235, except G3362 ye repent G3340 (PresActSubj), ye shall G0622 all G3956 likewise G5615 perish G0622 (FutMidInd).
013:004 Or G2228 those G1565 eighteen G1176 G2532 G3638, upon G1909 whom G3739 the tower G4444 in G1722 Siloam G4611 fell G4098 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 slew G0615 (AorActInd) them G0846, think ye G1380 (PresActInd) that G3754 they G3778 were G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) sinners G3781 above G3844 all G3956 men G0444 that dwelt G2730 (PresActPtc) in G1722 Jerusalem G2419?
013:005 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213, Nay G3780: but G0235, except G3362 ye repent G3340 (PresActSubj), ye shall G0622 all G3956 likewise G3668 perish G0622 (FutMidInd).
013:006 He spake G3004 (ImpfActInd) also G1161 this G5026 parable G3850; A certain G5100 [man] had G2192 (ImpfActInd) a fig tree G4808 planted G5452 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 his G0846 vineyard G0290; and G2532 he came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) and sought G2212 (PresActPtc) fruit G2590 thereon G1722 G0846, and G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) none G3756.
013:007 Then G1161 said he G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the dresser of his vineyard G0289, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), these three G5140 years G2094 I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) seeking G2212 (PresActPtc) fruit G2590 on G1722 this G5026 fig tree G4808, and G2532 find G2147 (PresActInd) none G3756: cut G1581 it G0846 down G1581 (AorActImpr); why G2444 G2532 cumbereth G2673 (PresActInd) it G0846 the ground G1093?
013:008 And G1161 he answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, let G0863 it G0846 alone G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) this G5124 year G2094 also G2532, till G2193 G3755 I shall dig G4626 (AorActSubj) about G4012 it G0846, and G2532 dung G0906 (Aor2ActSubj) G2874 [it]:
013:009 And if G2579 G3303 it bear G4160 (AorActSubj) fruit G2590, [well]: and if not G1490, [then] after that G1519 G3195 (PresActPtc) thou shalt cut G1581 it G0846 down G1581 (FutActInd).
013:010 And G1161 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) in G1722 one G3391 of the synagogues G4864 on G1722 the sabbath G4521.
013:011 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a woman G1135 which had G2192 (PresActPtc) a spirit G4151 of infirmity G0769 eighteen G1176 G2532 G3638 years G2094, and G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) bowed together G4794 (PresActPtc), and G2532 could G1410 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1519 no G3361 wise G3838 lift up G0352 (AorActInf) [herself].
013:012 And G1161 when Jesus G2424 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) her G0846, he called G4377 (AorActInd) [her to him], and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto her G0846, Woman G1135, thou art loosed G0630 (PerfPasInd) from thine G4675 infirmity G0769.
013:013 And G2532 he laid G2007 [his] hands G5495 on G2007 (AorActInd) her G0846: and G2532 immediately G3916 she was made straight G0461 (AorPasInd), and G2532 glorified G1392 (ImpfActInd) God G2316.
013:014 And G1161 the ruler of the synagogue G0752 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) with indignation G0023 (PresActPtc), because G3754 that Jesus G2424 had healed G2323 (AorActInd) on the sabbath G4521 day, and said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto the people G3793, There are G1526 (PresInd) six G1803 days G2250 in G1722 which G3739 men ought G1163 (PresInd) to work G2038 (PresMidPasDepInf): in G1722 them G5025 therefore G3767 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) and be healed G2323 (PresPasImpr), and G2532 not G3361 on the sabbath G4521 day G2250.
013:015 The Lord G2962 then G3767 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), [Thou] hypocrite G5273, doth G3089 not G3756 each one G1538 of you G5216 on the sabbath G4521 loose G3089 (PresActInd) his G0846 ox G1016 or G2228 [his] ass G3688 from G0575 the stall G5336, and G2532 lead [him] away G0520 (Aor2ActPtc) to watering G4222 (PresActInd)?
013:016 And G1161 ought G1163 (ImpfInd) not G3756 this woman G5026, being G5607 (PresPtc) a daughter G2364 of Abraham G0011, whom G3739 Satan G4567 hath bound G1210 (AorActInd), lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), these eighteen G1176 G2532 G3638 years G2094, be loosed G3089 (AorPasInf) from G0575 this G5127 bond G1199 on the sabbath G4521 day G2250?
013:017 And G2532 when he G0846 had said G3004 (PresActPtc) these things G5023, all G3956 his G0846 adversaries G0480 (PresMidPasDepPtc) were ashamed G2617 (ImpfPasInd): and G2532 all G3956 the people G3793 rejoiced G5463 (ImpfActInd) for G1909 all G3956 the glorious things G1741 that were done G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) by G5259 him G0846.
013:018 Then G1161 said he G3004 (ImpfActInd), Unto what G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 like G3664? and G2532 whereunto G5101 shall I resemble G3666 (FutActInd) it G0846?
013:019 It is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 a grain G2848 of mustard seed G4615, which G3739 a man G0444 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc), and cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 his G1438 garden G2779; and G2532 it grew G0837 (AorActInd), and G2532 waxed G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) G1519 a great G3173 tree G1186; and G2532 the fowls G4071 of the air G3772 lodged G2681 (AorActInd) in G1722 the branches G2798 of it G0846.
013:020 And G2532 again G3825 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Whereunto G5101 shall I liken G3666 (FutActInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316?
013:021 It is G2076 (PresInd) like G3664 leaven G2219, which G3739 a woman G1135 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) and hid G1470 (AorActInd) in G1519 three G5140 measures G4568 of meal G0224, till G2193 G3739 the whole G3650 was leavened G2220 (AorPasInd).
013:022 And G2532 he went G1279 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) through G2596 the cities G4172 and G2532 villages G2968, teaching G1321 (PresActPtc), and G2532 journeying G4160 (PresMidPtc) G4197 toward G1519 Jerusalem G2419.
013:023 Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) one G5100 unto G4314 him G0846, Lord G2962, are there few G1487 G3641 that be saved G4982 (PresPasPtc)? And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846,
013:024 Strive G0075 (PresMidPasDepImpr) to enter in G1525 (Aor2ActInf) at G1223 the strait G4728 gate G4439: for G3754 many G4183, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, will seek G2212 (FutActInd) to enter in G1525 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 shall G2480 not G3756 be able G2480 (FutActInd).
013:025 When once G0575 G3739 G0302 the master of the house G3617 is risen up G1453 (AorPasSubj), and G2532 hath shut G0608 (AorActSubj) to the door G2374, and G2532 ye begin G0756 (AorMidSubj) to stand G2476 (PerfActInf) without G1854, and G2532 to knock G2925 (PresActInf) at the door G2374, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, Lord G2962, open G0455 (AorActImpr) unto us G2254; and G2532 he shall answer G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and say G2046 (FutActInd) unto you G5213, I know G1492 (PerfActInd) you G5209 not G3756 whence G4159 ye are G2075 (PresInd):
013:026 Then G5119 shall ye begin G0756 (FutMidInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf), We have eaten G5315 (Aor2ActInd) and G2532 drunk G4095 (Aor2ActInd) in thy G4675 presence G1799, and G2532 thou hast taught G1321 (AorActInd) in G1722 our G2257 streets G4113.
013:027 But G2532 he shall say G2046 (FutActInd), I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213, I know G1492 (PerfActInd) you G5209 not G3756 whence G4159 ye are G2075 (PresInd); depart G0868 (Aor2ActImpr) from G0575 me G1700, all G3956 [ye] workers G2040 of iniquity G0093.
013:028 There G1563 shall be G2071 (FutInd) weeping G2805 and G2532 gnashing G1030 of teeth G3599, when G3752 ye shall see G3700 (AorMidDepSubj) Abraham G0011, and G2532 Isaac G2464, and G2532 Jacob G2384, and G2532 all G3956 the prophets G4396, in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316, and G1161 you G5209 [yourselves] thrust G1544 (PresPasPtc) out G1854.
013:029 And G2532 they shall come G2240 (FutActInd) from G0575 the east G0395, and G2532 [from] the west G1424, and G2532 from G0575 the north G1005, and G2532 [from] the south G3558, and G2532 shall sit down G0347 (FutPasInd) in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
013:030 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there are G1526 (PresInd) last G2078 which G3739 shall be G2071 (FutInd) first G4413, and G2532 there are G1526 (PresInd) first G4413 which G3739 shall be G2071 (FutInd) last G2078.
013:031 The same G1722 G0846 day G2250 there came G4334 (AorActInd) certain G5100 of the Pharisees G5330, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846, Get thee out G1831 (Aor2ActImpr), and G2532 depart G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr) hence G1782: for G3754 Herod G2264 will G2309 (PresActInd) kill G0615 (AorActInf) thee G4571.
013:032 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Go ye G4198 (AorPasDepPtc), and tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) that G5026 fox G0258, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I cast out G1544 (PresActInd) devils G1140, and G2532 I do G2005 (PresActInd) cures G2392 to day G4594 and G2532 to morrow G0839, and G2532 the third G5154 [day] I shall be perfected G5048 (PresPasInd).
013:033 Nevertheless G4133 I G3165 must G1163 (PresInd) walk G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) to day G4594, and G2532 to morrow G0839, and G2532 the [day] following G2192 (PresPasPtc): for G3754 it cannot be G3756 G1735 (PresMidPasDepInd) that a prophet G4396 perish G0622 (Aor2MidInf) out of G1854 Jerusalem G2419.
013:034 O Jerusalem G2419, Jerusalem G2419, which G3588 killest G0615 (PresActPtc) the prophets G4396, and G2532 stonest G3036 (PresActPtc) them that are sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc) unto G4314 thee G0846; how often G4212 would G2309 (AorActInd) I have gathered G1996 thy G4675 children G5043 together G1996 (AorActInf), as G3739 G5158 a hen G3733 [doth gather] her G1438 brood G3555 under G5259 [her] wings G4420, and G2532 ye would G2309 (AorActInd) not G3756!
013:035 Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), your G5216 house G3624 is left G0863 (PresPasInd) unto you G5213 desolate G2048: and G1161 verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 Ye shall G1492 not G3364 see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) me G3165, until G2193 G0302 [the time] come G2240 (AorActSubj) when G3753 ye shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), Blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [is] he that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962.
014:001 ¶  And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G1722 he G0846 went G2064 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the house G3624 of one G5100 of the chief G0758 Pharisees G5330 to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) bread G0740 on the sabbath G4521 day, that G2532 they G0846 watched G2258 (ImpfInd) G3906 (PresMidPtc) him G0846.
014:002 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a certain G5100 man G0444 before G1715 him G0846 which had the dropsy G5203.
014:003 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the lawyers G3544 and G2532 Pharisees G5330, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Is it G1487 lawful G1832 (PresInd) to heal G2323 (PresActInf) on the sabbath day G4521?
014:004 And G1161 they held their peace G2270 (AorActInd). And G2532 he took G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) [him], and healed G2390 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, and G2532 let him go G0630 (AorActInd);
014:005 And G2532 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) them G4314 G0846, saying G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Which G5101 of you G5216 shall have an ass G3688 or G2228 an ox G1016 fallen G1706 (FutMidDepInd) into G1519 a pit G5421, and G2532 will G0385 not G3756 straightway G2112 pull G0385 him G0846 out G0385 (FutActInd) on G1722 the sabbath G4521 day G2250?
014:006 And G2532 they could G2480 (AorActInd) not G3756 answer G0470 him G0846 again G0470 (AorPasDepInf) to G4314 these things G5023.
014:007 And G1161 he put forth G3004 (ImpfActInd) a parable G3850 to G4314 those which were bidden G2564 (PerfPasPtc), when he marked G1907 (PresActPtc) how G4459 they chose out G1586 (ImpfMidInd) the chief rooms G4411; saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto G4314 them G0846,
014:008 When G3752 thou art bidden G2564 (AorPasSubj) of G5259 any G5100 [man] to G1519 a wedding G1062, sit G2625 not G3361 down G2625 (AorPasSubj) in G1519 the highest room G4411; lest G3379 a more honourable man G1784 than thou G4675 be G5600 (PresSubj) bidden G2564 (PerfPasPtc) of G5259 him G0846;
014:009 And G2532 he that bade G2564 (AorActPtc) thee G4571 and G2532 him G0846 come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) and say G2046 (FutActInd) to thee G4671, Give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) this man G5129 place G5117; and G2532 G5119 thou begin G0756 (AorMidSubj) with G3326 shame G0152 to take G2722 (PresActInf) the lowest G2078 room G5117.
014:010 But G0235 when G3752 thou art bidden G2564 (AorPasSubj), go G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) and sit down G0377 (AorActImpr) in G1519 the lowest G2078 room G5117; that G2443 when G3752 he that bade G2564 (PerfActPtc) thee G4571 cometh G2064 (Aor2ActSubj), he may say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) unto thee G4671, Friend G5384, go up G4320 (Aor2ActImpr) higher G0511: then G5119 shalt thou G4671 have G2071 (FutInd) worship G1391 in the presence G1799 of them that sit at meat G4873 (PresMidPasDepPtc) with thee G4671.
014:011 For G3754 whosoever G3956 exalteth G5312 (PresActPtc) himself G1438 shall be abased G5013 (FutPasInd); and G2532 he that humbleth G5013 (PresActPtc) himself G1438 shall be exalted G5312 (FutPasInd).
014:012 Then G1161 said he G3004 (ImpfActInd) also G2532 to him that bade G2564 (PerfActPtc) him G0846, When G3752 thou makest G4160 (PresActSubj) a dinner G0712 or G2228 a supper G1173, call G5455 (PresActImpr) not G3361 thy G4675 friends G5384, nor G3366 thy G4675 brethren G0080, neither G3366 thy G4675 kinsmen G4773, nor G3366 [thy] rich G4145 neighbours G1069; lest G3379 they G0846 also G2532 bid G0479 thee G4571 again G0479 (AorActSubj), and G2532 a recompence G0468 be made G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) thee G4671.
014:013 But G0235 when G3752 thou makest G4160 (PresActSubj) a feast G1403, call G2564 (PresActImpr) the poor G4434, the maimed G0376, the lame G5560, the blind G5185:
014:014 And G2532 thou shalt be G2071 (FutInd) blessed G3107; for G3754 they cannot G3756 G2192 (PresActInd) recompense G0467 (Aor2ActInf) thee G4671: for G1063 thou G4671 shalt be recompensed G0467 (FutPasInd) at G1722 the resurrection G0386 of the just G1342.
014:015 And G1161 when one G5100 of them that sat at meat with him G4873 (PresMidPasDepPtc) heard G0191 (AorActPtc) these things G5023, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Blessed G3107 [is] he G3739 that shall eat G5315 (FutMidDepInd) bread G0740 in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
014:016 Then G1161 said he G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, A certain G5100 man G0444 made G4160 (AorActInd) a great G3173 supper G1173, and G2532 bade G2564 (AorActInd) many G4183:
014:017 And G2532 sent G0649 (AorActInd) his G0846 servant G1401 at supper G1173 time G5610 to say G2036 (Aor2ActInf) to them that were bidden G2564 (PerfPasPtc), Come G2064 (PresMidPasDepImpr); for G3754 all things G3956 are G2076 (PresInd) now G2235 ready G2092.
014:018 And G2532 they all G3956 with G0575 one G3391 [consent] began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to make excuse G3868 (PresMidPasDepInf). The first G4413 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, I have bought G0059 (AorActInd) a piece of ground G0068, and G2532 I must G2192 (PresActInd) needs G0318 go G1831 (Aor2ActInf) and G2532 see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) it G0846: I pray G2065 (PresActInd) thee G4571 have G2192 (PresActImpr) me G3165 excused G3868 (PerfPasPtc).
014:019 And G2532 another G2087 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I have bought G0059 (AorActInd) five G4002 yoke G2201 of oxen G1016, and G2532 I go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd) to prove G1381 (AorActInf) them G0846: I pray G2065 (PresActInd) thee G4571 have G2192 (PresActImpr) me G3165 excused G3868 (PerfPasPtc).
014:020 And G2532 another G2087 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I have married G1060 (AorActInd) a wife G1135, and G2532 therefore G1223 G5124 I cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) come G2064 (Aor2ActInf).
014:021 So G2532 that G1565 servant G1401 came G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc), and shewed G0518 (AorActInd) his G0846 lord G2962 these things G5023. Then G5119 the master of the house G3617 being angry G3710 (AorPasPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to his G0846 servant G1401, Go out G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) quickly G5030 into G1519 the streets G4113 and G2532 lanes G4505 of the city G4172, and G2532 bring in G1521 (Aor2ActImpr) hither G5602 the poor G4434, and G2532 the maimed G0376, and G2532 the halt G5560, and G2532 the blind G5185.
014:022 And G2532 the servant G1401 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, it is done G1096 (Perf2ActInd) as G5613 thou hast commanded G2004 (AorActInd), and G2532 yet G2089 there is G2076 (PresInd) room G5117.
014:023 And G2532 the lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the servant G1401, Go out G1831 (Aor2ActImpr) into G1519 the highways G3598 and G2532 hedges G5418, and G2532 compel G0315 (AorActImpr) [them] to come in G1525 (Aor2ActInf), that G2443 my G3450 house G3624 may be filled G1072 (AorPasSubj).
014:024 For G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 none G3762 of those G1565 men G0435 which G3588 were bidden G2564 (PerfPasPtc) shall taste G1089 (FutMidDepInd) of my G3450 supper G1173.
014:025 And G1161 there went G4848 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) great G4183 multitudes G3793 with him G0846: and G2532 he turned G4762 (Aor2PasPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846,
014:026 If any G1536 [man] come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) to G4314 me G3165, and G2532 hate G3404 (PresActInd) not G3756 his G1438 father G3962, and G2532 mother G3384, and G2532 wife G1135, and G2532 children G5043, and G2532 brethren G0080, and G2532 sisters G0079, yea G2089, and G1161 his own G1438 life G5590 also G2532, he cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be G1511 (PresInf) my G3450 disciple G3101.
014:027 And G2532 whosoever G3748 doth G0941 not G3756 bear G0941 (PresActInd) his G0846 cross G4716, and G2532 come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) after G3694 me G3450, cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be G1511 (PresInf) my G3450 disciple G3101.
014:028 For G1063 which G5101 of G1537 you G5216, intending G2309 (PresActPtc) to build G3618 (AorActInf) a tower G4444, sitteth G2523 not G3780 down G2523 (AorActPtc) first G4412, and counteth G5585 (PresActInd) the cost G1160, whether G1487 he have G2192 (PresActInd) [sufficient] to G4314 finish G0535 [it]?
014:029 Lest G3363 haply G3379, after he G0846 hath laid G5087 (Aor2ActPtc) the foundation G2310, and G2532 is G2480 not G3361 able G2480 (PresActPtc) to finish G1615 (AorActInf) [it], all G3956 that behold G2334 (PresActPtc) [it] begin G0756 (AorMidSubj) to mock G1702 (PresActInf) him G0846,
014:030 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This G3754 G3778 man G0444 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to build G3618 (PresActInf), and G2532 was G2480 not G3756 able G2480 (AorActInd) to finish G1615 (AorActInf).
014:031 Or G2228 what G5101 king G0935, going G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to make G4820 (Aor2ActInf) war G4171 against G1519 another G2087 king G0935, sitteth G2523 not G3780 down G2523 (AorActPtc) first G4412, and consulteth G1011 (PresMidPasDepInd) whether G1487 he be G2076 (PresInd) able G1415 with G1722 ten G1176 thousand G5505 to meet G0528 (AorActInf) him that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) against G1909 him G0846 with G3326 twenty G1501 thousand G5505?
014:032 Or else G1490, while the other G0846 is G5607 (PresPtc) yet G2089 a great way off G4206, he sendeth G0649 (AorActPtc) an ambassage G4242, and desireth G2065 (PresActInd) conditions G4314 of peace G1515.
014:033 So G3779 likewise G3767, whosoever G3956 he be of G1537 you G5216 that G3739 forsaketh G0657 (PresMidInd) not G3756 all G3956 that he hath G5224 (PresActPtc) G1438, he cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) be G1511 (PresInf) my G3450 disciple G3101.
014:034 Salt G0217 [is] good G2570: but G1161 if G1437 the salt G0217 have lost his savour G3471 (AorPasSubj), wherewith G1722 G5101 shall it be seasoned G0741 (FutPasInd)?
014:035 It is G2076 (PresInd) neither G3777 fit G2111 for G1519 the land G1093, nor yet G3777 for G1519 the dunghill G2874; [but] men cast G0906 (PresActInd) it G0846 out G1854. He that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) ears G3775 to hear G0191 (PresActInf), let him hear G0191 (PresActImpr).
015:001 ¶  Then G1161 drew near G2258 (ImpfInd) G1448 (PresActPtc) unto him G0846 all G3956 the publicans G5057 and G2532 sinners G0268 for to hear G0191 (PresActInf) him G0846.
015:002 And G2532 the Pharisees G5330 and G2532 scribes G1122 murmured G1234 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This man G3754 G3778 receiveth G4327 (PresMidPasDepInd) sinners G0268, and G2532 eateth G4906 (PresActInd) with them G0846.
015:003 And G1161 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) this G5026 parable G3850 unto G4314 them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
015:004 What G5101 man G0444 of G1537 you G5216, having G2192 (PresActPtc) an hundred G1540 sheep G4263, if G2532 he lose G0622 (AorActPtc) one G1520 of G1537 them G0846, doth G2641 not G3756 leave G2641 (PresActInd) the ninety and nine G1768 in G1722 the wilderness G2048, and G2532 go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd) after G1909 that which is lost G0622 (Perf2ActPtc), until G2193 he find G2147 (Aor2ActSubj) it G0846?
015:005 And G2532 when he hath found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], he layeth G2007 (PresActInd) [it] on G1909 his G1438 shoulders G5606, rejoicing G5463 (PresActPtc).
015:006 And G2532 when he cometh G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) G1519 home G3624, he calleth together G4779 (PresActInd) [his] friends G5384 and G2532 neighbours G1069, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto them G0846, Rejoice G4796 (Aor2PasDepImpr) with me G3427; for G3754 I have found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) my G3450 sheep G4263 which G3588 was lost G0622 (Perf2ActPtc).
015:007 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 likewise G3779 joy G5479 shall be G2071 (FutInd) in G1722 heaven G3772 over G1909 one G1520 sinner G0268 that repenteth G3340 (PresActPtc), more than G2228 over G1909 ninety and nine G1768 just persons G1342, which G3748 need G2192 (PresActInd) G5532 no G3756 repentance G3341.
015:008 Either G2228 what G5101 woman G1135 having G2192 (PresActPtc) ten G1176 pieces of silver G1406, if G1437 she lose G0622 (AorActSubj) one G3391 piece G1406, doth not G3780 light G0681 (PresActInd) a candle G3088, and G2532 sweep G4563 (PresActInd) the house G3614, and G2532 seek G2212 (PresActInd) diligently G1960 till G2193 G3755 she find G2147 (Aor2ActSubj) [it]?
015:009 And G2532 when she hath found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], she calleth G4779 [her] friends G5384 and G2532 [her] neighbours G1069 together G4779 (PresMidInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Rejoice G4796 (Aor2PasDepImpr) with me G3427; for G3754 I have found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) the piece G1406 which G3739 I had lost G0622 (AorActInd).
015:010 Likewise G3779, I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, there is G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd) joy G5479 in the presence G1799 of the angels G0032 of God G2316 over G1909 one G1520 sinner G0268 that repenteth G3340 (PresActPtc).
015:011 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), A certain G5100 man G0444 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) two G1417 sons G5207:
015:012 And G2532 the younger G3501 of them G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to [his] father G3962, Father G3962, give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427 the portion G3313 of goods G3776 that falleth G1911 (PresActPtc) [to me]. And G2532 he divided G1244 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846 [his] living G0979.
015:013 And G2532 not G3756 many G4183 days G2250 after G3326 the younger G3501 son G5207 gathered G4863 all G0537 together G4863 (Aor2ActPtc), and took his journey G0589 (AorActInd) into G1519 a far G3117 country G5561, and G2532 there G1563 wasted G1287 (AorActInd) his G0846 substance G3776 with riotous G0811 living G2198 (PresActPtc).
015:014 And G1161 when he G0846 had spent G1159 (AorActPtc) all G3956, there arose G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a mighty G2478 famine G3042 in G2596 that G1565 land G5561; and G2532 he G0846 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to be in want G5302 (PresPasInf).
015:015 And G2532 he went G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) and joined himself G2853 (AorPasInd) to G1520 a citizen G4177 of that G1565 country G5561; and G2532 he sent G3992 (AorActInd) him G0846 into G1519 his G0846 fields G0068 to feed G1006 (PresActInf) swine G5519.
015:016 And G2532 he would fain G1937 (ImpfActInd) have filled G1072 (AorActInf) his G0846 belly G2836 with G0575 the husks G2769 that G3739 the swine G5519 did eat G2068 (ImpfActInd): and G2532 no man G3762 gave G1325 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846.
015:017 And G1161 when he came G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G1519 himself G1438, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), How many G4214 hired servants G3407 of my G3450 father’s G3962 have bread G0740 enough and to spare G4052 (PresActInd), and G1161 I G1473 perish G0622 (PresMidInd) with hunger G3042!
015:018 I will arise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) and go G4198 (FutMidDepInd) to G4314 my G3450 father G3962, and G2532 will say G2046 (FutActInd) unto him G0846, Father G3962, I have sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd) against G1519 heaven G3772, and G2532 before G1799 thee G4675,
015:019 And G2532 am G1510 (PresInd) no more G3765 worthy G0514 to be called G2564 (AorPasInf) thy G4675 son G5207: make G4160 (AorActImpr) me G3165 as G5613 one G1520 of thy G4675 hired servants G3407.
015:020 And G2532 he arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 his G1438 father G3962. But G1161 when he G0846 was yet G2089 a great way G3112 off G0568 (PresActPtc), his G0846 father G3962 saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, and G2532 had compassion G4697 (AorPasDepInd), and G2532 ran G5143 (Aor2ActPtc), and fell G1968 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 his G0846 neck G5137, and G2532 kissed G2705 (AorActInd) him G0846.
015:021 And G1161 the son G5207 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Father G3962, I have sinned G0264 (Aor2ActInd) against G1519 heaven G3772, and G2532 in G1799 thy G4675 sight G1799, and G2532 am G1510 (PresInd) no more G3765 worthy G0514 to be called G2564 (AorPasInf) thy G4675 son G5207.
015:022 But G1161 the father G3962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to G4314 his G0846 servants G1401, Bring forth G1627 (AorActImpr) the best G4413 robe G4749, and G2532 put [it] on G1746 (AorActImpr) him G0846; and G2532 put G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) a ring G1146 on G1519 his G0846 hand G5495, and G2532 shoes G5266 on G1519 [his] feet G4228:
015:023 And G2532 bring hither G5342 (AorActPtc) the fatted G4618 calf G3448, and kill G2380 (AorActImpr) [it]; and G2532 let us eat G5315 (Aor2ActPtc), and be merry G2165 (AorPasSubj):
015:024 For G3754 this G3778 my G3450 son G5207 was G2258 (ImpfInd) dead G3498, and G2532 is alive again G0326 (AorActInd); G2532 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) lost G0622 (Perf2ActPtc), and G2532 is found G2147 (AorPasInd). And G2532 they began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to be merry G2165 (PresPasInf).
015:025 Now G1161 his G0846 elder G4245 son G5207 was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 the field G0068: and G2532 as G5613 he came G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) and drew nigh G1448 (AorActInd) to the house G3614, he heard G0191 (AorActInd) musick G4858 and G2532 dancing G5525.
015:026 And G2532 he called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) one G1520 of the servants G3816, and asked G4441 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) what G5101 these things G5023 meant G1498 (PresOpt).
015:027 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, G3754 Thy G4675 brother G0080 is come G2240 (PresActInd); and G2532 thy G4675 father G3962 hath killed G2380 (AorActInd) the fatted G4618 calf G3448, because G3754 he hath received G0618 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 safe and sound G5198 (PresActPtc).
015:028 And G1161 he was angry G3710 (AorPasInd), and G2532 would G2309 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 go in G1525 (Aor2ActInf): therefore G3767 came G1831 his G0846 father G3962 out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and intreated G3870 (ImpfActInd) him G0846.
015:029 And G1161 he answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to [his] father G3962, Lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), these many G5118 years G2094 do I serve G1398 (PresActInd) thee G4671, neither G3763 transgressed I G3928 (Aor2ActInd) at any time G3763 thy G4675 commandment G1785: and G2532 yet G2532 thou G1325 never G3763 gavest G1325 (AorActInd) me G1698 a kid G2056, that G2443 I might make merry G2165 (AorPasSubj) with G3326 my G3450 friends G5384:
015:030 But G1161 as soon as G3753 this G3778 thy G4675 son G5207 was come G2064 (Aor2ActInd), which G3588 hath devoured G2719 (Aor2ActPtc) thy G4675 living G0979 with G3326 harlots G4204, thou hast killed G2380 (AorActInd) for him G0846 the fatted G4618 calf G3448.
015:031 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Son G5043, thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) ever G3842 with G3326 me G1700, and G2532 all G3956 that I have G1699 is G2076 (PresInd) thine G4674.
015:032 It was G1161 meet G1163 (ImpfInd) that we should make merry G2165 (AorPasInf), and G2532 be glad G5463 (Aor2PasDepInf): for G3754 this G3778 thy G4675 brother G0080 was G2258 (ImpfInd) dead G3498, and G2532 is alive again G0326 (AorActInd); and G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) lost G0622 (Perf2ActPtc), and G2532 is found G2147 (AorPasInd).
016:001 ¶  And G1161 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) also G2532 unto G4314 his G0846 disciples G3101, There was G2258 (ImpfInd) a certain G5100 rich G4145 man G0444, which G3739 had G2192 (ImpfActInd) a steward G3623; and G2532 the same G3778 was accused G1225 (AorPasInd) unto him G0846 that G5613 he had wasted G1287 (PresActPtc) his G0846 goods G5224 (PresActPtc).
016:002 And G2532 he called G5455 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, How G5101 is it that I hear G0191 (PresActInd) this G5124 of G4012 thee G4675? give G0591 (Aor2ActImpr) an account G3056 of thy G4675 stewardship G3622; for G1063 thou mayest be G1410 (FutMidDepInd) no G3756 longer G2089 steward G3621 (PresActInf).
016:003 Then G1161 the steward G3623 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) within G1722 himself G1438, What G5101 shall I do G4160 (AorActSubj)? for G3754 my G3450 lord G2962 taketh away G0851 (PresMidInd) from G0575 me G1700 the stewardship G3622: I cannot G3756 G2480 (PresActInd) dig G4626 (PresActInf); to beg G1871 (PresActInf) I am ashamed G0153 (PresMidPasInd).
016:004 I am resolved G1097 (Aor2ActInd) what G5101 to do G4160 (FutActInd), that G2443, when G3752 I am put out G3179 (AorPasSubj) of the stewardship G3622, they may receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) me G3165 into G1519 their G0846 houses G3624.
016:005 So G2532 he called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) every G1538 one G1520 of his G1438 lord’s G2962 debtors G5533 [unto him], and said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto the first G4413, How much G4214 owest thou G3784 (PresActInd) unto my G3450 lord G2962?
016:006 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), An hundred G1540 measures G0943 of oil G1637. And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Take G1209 (AorMidDepImpr) thy G4675 bill G1121, and G2532 sit down G2523 (AorActPtc) quickly G5030, and write G1125 (AorActImpr) fifty G4004.
016:007 Then G1899 said he G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to another G2087, And G1161 how much G4214 owest G3784 (PresActInd) thou G4771? And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), An hundred G1540 measures G2884 of wheat G4621. And G2532 he said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Take G1209 (AorMidDepImpr) thy G4675 bill G1121, and G2532 write G1125 (AorActImpr) fourscore G3589.
016:008 And G2532 the lord G2962 commended G1867 (AorActInd) the unjust G0093 steward G3623, because G3754 he had done G4160 (AorActInd) wisely G5430: for G3754 the children G5207 of this G5127 world G0165 are G1526 (PresInd) in G1519 their G1438 generation G1074 wiser G5429 than G5228 the children G5207 of light G5457.
016:009 And I G2504 say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Make G4160 (AorActImpr) to yourselves G1438 friends G5384 of G1537 the mammon G3126 of unrighteousness G0093; that G2443, when G3752 ye fail G1587 (Aor2ActSubj), they may receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) you G5209 into G1519 everlasting G0166 habitations G4633.
016:010 He that is faithful G4103 in G1722 that which is least G1646 is G2076 (PresInd) faithful G4103 also G2532 in G1722 much G4183: and G2532 he that is unjust G0094 in G1722 the least G1646 is G2076 (PresInd) unjust G0094 also G2532 in G1722 much G4183.
016:011 If G1487 therefore G3767 ye have G1096 not G3756 been G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) faithful G4103 in G1722 the unrighteous G0094 mammon G3126, who G5101 will commit G4100 to your G5213 trust G4100 (FutActInd) the true G0228 [riches]?
016:012 And G2532 if G1487 ye have G1096 not G3756 been G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) faithful G4103 in G1722 that which is another man’s G0245, who G5101 shall give G1325 (FutActInd) you G5213 that which is your own G5212?
016:013 No G3762 servant G3610 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) serve G1398 (PresActInf) two G1417 masters G2962: for G1063 either G2228 he will hate G3404 (FutActInd) the one G1520, and G2532 love G0025 (FutActInd) the other G2087; or else G2228 he will hold G0472 (FutMidDepInd) to the one G1520, and G2532 despise G2706 (FutActInd) the other G2087. Ye cannot G3756 G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) serve G1398 (PresActInf) God G2316 and G2532 mammon G3126.
016:014 And G1161 the Pharisees G5330 also G2532, who were G5225 (PresActPtc) covetous G5366, heard G0191 (ImpfActInd) all G3956 these things G5023: and G2532 they derided G1592 (ImpfActInd) him G0846.
016:015 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) they which justify G1344 (PresActPtc) yourselves G1438 before G1799 men G0444; but G1161 God G2316 knoweth G1097 (PresActInd) your G5216 hearts G2588: for G3754 that which is highly esteemed G5308 among G1722 men G0444 is G2076 (PresInd) abomination G0946 in the sight G1799 of God G2316.
016:016 The law G3551 and G2532 the prophets G4396 [were] until G2193 John G2491: since G0575 that time G5119 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is preached G2097 (PresPasInd), and G2532 every man G3956 presseth G0971 (PresMidInd) into G1519 it G0846.
016:017 And G1161 it is G2076 (PresInd) easier G2123 for heaven G3772 and G2532 earth G1093 to pass G3928 (Aor2ActInf), than G2228 one G3391 tittle G2762 of the law G3551 to fail G4098 (Aor2ActInf).
016:018 Whosoever G3956 putteth away G0630 (PresActPtc) his G0846 wife G1135, and G2532 marrieth G1060 (PresActPtc) another G2087, committeth adultery G3431 (PresActInd): and G2532 whosoever G3956 marrieth G1060 (PresActPtc) her that is put away G0630 (PerfPasPtc) from G0575 [her] husband G0435 committeth adultery G3431 (PresActInd).
016:019 G1161 There was G2258 (ImpfInd) a certain G5100 rich G4145 man G0444, which G2532 was clothed G1737 (ImpfMidInd) in purple G4209 and G2532 fine linen G1040, and fared G2165 (PresPasPtc) sumptuously G2988 every G2596 day G2250:
016:020 And G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a certain G5100 beggar G4434 named G3686 Lazarus G2976, which G3739 was laid G0906 (PlupfPasInd) at G4314 his G0846 gate G4440, full of sores G1669 (PerfPasPtc),
016:021 And G2532 desiring G1937 (PresActPtc) to be fed G5526 (AorPasInf) with G0575 the crumbs G5589 which G3588 fell G4098 (PresActPtc) from G0575 the rich man’s G4145 table G5132: moreover G0235 G2532 the dogs G2965 came G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) and licked G0621 (ImpfActInd) his G0846 sores G1668.
016:022 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that the beggar G4434 died G0599 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 was carried G0667 (AorPasInf) by G5259 the angels G0032 into G1519 Abraham’s G0011 bosom G2859: the rich man G4145 also G1161 G2532 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 was buried G2290 (Aor2PasDepSubj);
016:023 And G2532 in G1722 hell G0086 he lift up G1869 (AorActPtc) his G0846 eyes G3788, being G5225 (PresActPtc) in G1722 torments G0931, and seeth G3708 (PresActInd) Abraham G0011 afar G3113 off G0575, and G2532 Lazarus G2976 in G1722 his G0846 bosom G2859.
016:024 And G2532 G0846 he cried G5455 (AorActPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Father G3962 Abraham G0011, have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on me G3165, and G2532 send G3992 (AorActImpr) Lazarus G2976, that G2443 he may dip G0911 (AorActSubj) the tip G0206 of his G0846 finger G1147 in water G5204, and G2532 cool G2711 (AorActSubj) my G3450 tongue G1100; for G3754 I am tormented G3600 (PresPasInd) in G1722 this G5026 flame G5395.
016:025 But G1161 Abraham G0011 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Son G5043, remember G3415 (AorPasImpr) that G3754 thou G4771 in G1722 thy G4675 lifetime G2222 receivedst G0618 (Aor2ActInd) thy G4675 good things G0018, and G2532 likewise G3668 Lazarus G2976 evil things G2556: but G1161 now G3568 G3592 he is comforted G3870 (PresPasInd), and G1161 thou G4771 art tormented G3600 (PresPasInd).
016:026 And G2532 beside G1909 all G3956 this G5125, between G3342 us G2257 and G2532 you G5216 there is G4741 a great G3173 gulf G5490 fixed G4741 (PerfPasInd): so that G3704 they which would G2309 (PresActPtc) pass G1224 (Aor2ActInf) from hence G1782 to G4314 you G5209 cannot G3361 G1410 (PresMidPasDepSubj); neither G3366 can they pass G1276 (PresActSubj) to G4314 us G2248, that [would come] from thence G1564.
016:027 Then G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I pray G2065 (PresActInd) thee G4571 therefore G3767, father G3962, that G2443 thou wouldest send G3992 (AorActSubj) him G0846 to G1519 my G3450 father’s G3962 house G3624:
016:028 For G1063 I have G2192 (PresActInd) five G4002 brethren G0080; that G3704 he may testify G1263 (PresMidPasDepSubj) unto them G0846, lest G3363 they G0846 also G2532 come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 this G5126 place G5117 of torment G0931.
016:029 Abraham G0011 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, They have G2192 (PresActInd) Moses G3475 and G2532 the prophets G4396; let them hear G0191 (AorActImpr) them G0846.
016:030 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Nay G3780, father G3962 Abraham G0011: but G0235 if G1437 one G5100 went G4198 (AorPasDepSubj) unto G4314 them G0846 from G0575 the dead G3498, they will repent G3340 (FutActInd).
016:031 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, If G1487 they hear G0191 (PresActInd) not G3756 Moses G3475 and G2532 the prophets G4396, neither G3761 will they be persuaded G3982 (FutPasInd), though G1437 one G5100 rose G0450 (Aor2ActSubj) from G1537 the dead G3498.
017:001 ¶  Then G1161 said he G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the disciples G3101, It is G2076 (PresInd) impossible G0418 but G3361 that offences G4625 will come G2064 (Aor2ActInf): but G1161 woe G3759 [unto him], through G1223 whom G3739 they come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd)!
017:002 It were better G3081 (PresActInd) for him G0846 that G1487 a millstone G3458 G3684 were hanged G4029 (PresMidPasDepInd) about G4012 his G0846 neck G5137, and G2532 he cast G4496 (PerfPasInd) into G1519 the sea G2281, than G2228 that G2443 he should offend G4624 (AorActSubj) one G1520 of these G5130 little ones G3398.
017:003 Take heed G4337 (PresActImpr) to yourselves G1438: If G1161 G1437 thy G4675 brother G0080 trespass G0264 (Aor2ActSubj) against G1519 thee G4571, rebuke G2008 (AorActImpr) him G0846; and G2532 if G1437 he repent G3340 (AorActSubj), forgive G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) him G0846.
017:004 And G2532 if G1437 he trespass G0264 (Aor2ActSubj) against G1519 thee G4571 seven times G2034 in a day G2250, and G2532 seven times G2034 in a day G2250 turn again G1994 (AorActSubj) to G1909 thee G4571, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), I repent G3340 (PresActInd); thou shalt forgive G0863 (FutActInd) him G0846.
017:005 And G2532 the apostles G0652 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto the Lord G2962, Increase G4369 (Aor2ActImpr) our G2254 faith G4102.
017:006 And G1161 the Lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), If G1487 ye had G2192 (ImpfActInd) faith G4102 as G5613 a grain G2848 of mustard seed G4615, ye might G0302 say G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto this G5026 sycamine G4807 tree, Be thou plucked up by the root G1610 (AorPasImpr), and G2532 be thou planted G5452 (AorPasImpr) in G1722 the sea G2281; and G2532 it should G0302 obey G5219 (AorActInd) you G5213.
017:007 But G1161 which G5101 of G1537 you G5216, having G2192 (PresActPtc) a servant G1401 plowing G0722 (PresActPtc) or G2228 feeding cattle G4165 (PresActPtc), will say G2046 (FutActInd) unto him G3739 by and by G2112, when he is come G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) from G1537 the field G0068, Go G3928 (Aor2ActPtc) and sit down to meat G0377 (AorMidImpr)?
017:008 And G0235 will not G3780 rather say G2046 (FutActInd) unto him G0846, Make ready G2090 (AorActImpr) wherewith G5101 I may sup G1172 (AorActSubj), and G2532 gird thyself G4024 (AorMidPtc), and serve G1247 (PresActImpr) me G3427, till G2193 I have eaten G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) and G2532 drunken G4095 (Aor2ActSubj); and G2532 afterward G3326 G5023 thou G4771 shalt eat G5315 (FutMidDepInd) and G2532 drink G4095 (FutMidDepInd)?
017:009 G3361 Doth he G2192 (PresActInd) thank G5485 that G1565 servant G1401 because G3754 he did G4160 (AorActInd) the things that were commanded G1299 (AorPasPtc) him G0846? I trow G1380 (PresActInd) not G3756.
017:010 So G3779 likewise G2532 ye G5210, when G3752 ye shall have done G4160 (AorActSubj) all G3956 those things which are commanded G1299 (AorPasPtc) you G5213, say G3004 (PresActImpr), G3754 We are G2070 (PresInd) unprofitable G0888 servants G1401: G3754 we have done G4160 (AorActInf) that which G3739 was our duty G3784 (ImpfActInd) to do G4160 (PerfActInd).
017:011 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G1722 he G0846 went G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, that G2532 he G0846 passed G1330 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) through G1223 the midst G3319 of Samaria G4540 and G2532 Galilee G1056.
017:012 And G2532 as he G0846 entered G1525 (PresMidPasDepPtc) into G1519 a certain G5100 village G2968, there met G0528 (AorActInd) him G0846 ten G1176 men G0435 that were lepers G3015, which G3739 stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) afar off G4207:
017:013 And G2532 they G0846 lifted up G0142 (AorActInd) [their] voices G5456, and said G3004 (PresActPtc), Jesus G2424, Master G1988, have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on us G2248.
017:014 And G2532 when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [them], he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Go G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) shew G1925 (AorActImpr) yourselves G1438 unto the priests G2409. And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, as they G0846 went G5217 (PresActInf) G1722, they were cleansed G2511 (AorPasInd).
017:015 And G1161 one G1520 of G1537 them G0846, when he saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he was healed G2390 (AorPasInd), turned back G5290 (AorActInd), and with G3326 a loud G3173 voice G5456 glorified G1392 (PresActPtc) God G2316,
017:016 And G2532 fell down G4098 (Aor2ActInd) on G1909 [his] face G4383 at G3844 his G0846 feet G4228, giving G2168 him G0846 thanks G2168 (PresActPtc): and G2532 he G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a Samaritan G4541.
017:017 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Were there G2511 not G3780 ten G1176 cleansed G2511 (AorPasInd)? but G1161 where G4226 [are] the nine G1767?
017:018 There are G2147 not G3756 found G2147 (AorPasInd) that returned G5290 (AorActPtc) to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) glory G1391 to God G2316, save G1508 this G3778 stranger G0241.
017:019 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Arise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), go thy way G4198 (PresMidPasDepImpr): thy G4675 faith G4102 hath made G4982 thee G4571 whole G4982 (PerfActInd).
017:020 And G1161 when he was demanded G1905 (AorPasPtc) of G5259 the Pharisees G5330, when G4219 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 should come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), he answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) them G0846 and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), The kingdom G0932 of God G2316 cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 with G3326 observation G3907:
017:021 Neither G3761 shall they say G2046 (FutActInd), Lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) here G5602! or G2228, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) there G1563! for G1063, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) within G1787 you G5216.
017:022 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the disciples G3101, The days G2250 will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd), when G3753 ye shall desire G1937 (FutActInd) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) one G3391 of the days G2250 of the Son G5207 of man G0444, and G2532 ye shall G3700 not G3756 see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) [it].
017:023 And G2532 they shall say G2046 (FutActInd) to you G5213, See G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) here G5602; or G2228, see G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) there G1563: go G0565 not G3361 after G0565 (Aor2ActSubj) [them], nor G3366 follow G1377 (AorActSubj) [them].
017:024 For G1063 as G5618 the lightning G0796, that lighteneth G0797 (PresActPtc) out of G1537 the one [part] under G5259 heaven G3772, shineth G2989 (PresActInd) unto G1519 the other [part] under G5259 heaven G3772; so G3779 shall also G2532 the Son G5207 of man G0444 be G2071 (FutInd) in G1722 his G0846 day G2250.
017:025 But G1161 first G4412 must G1163 (PresInd) he G0846 suffer G3958 (Aor2ActInf) many things G4183, and G2532 be rejected G0593 (AorPasInf) of G0575 this G5026 generation G1074.
017:026 And G2532 as G2531 it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 the days G2250 of Noe G3575, so G3779 shall it be G2071 (FutInd) also G2532 in G1722 the days G2250 of the Son G5207 of man G0444.
017:027 They did eat G2068 (ImpfActInd), they drank G4095 (ImpfActInd), they married wives G1060 (ImpfActInd), they were given in marriage G1547 (ImpfPasInd), until G0891 the day G2250 that G3739 Noe G3575 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the ark G2787, and G2532 the flood G2627 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 destroyed G0622 (AorActInd) them all G0537.
017:028 Likewise G3668 also G2532 as G5613 it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) in G1722 the days G2250 of Lot G3091; they did eat G2068 (ImpfActInd), they drank G4095 (ImpfActInd), they bought G0059 (ImpfActInd), they sold G4453 (ImpfActInd), they planted G5452 (ImpfActInd), they builded G3618 (ImpfActInd);
017:029 But G3739 G1161 the same day G2250 that Lot G3091 went G1831 (Aor2ActInd) out of G0575 Sodom G4670 it rained G1026 (AorActInd) fire G4442 and G2532 brimstone G2303 from G0575 heaven G3772, and G2532 destroyed G0622 (AorActInd) [them] all G0537.
017:030 Even G2596 thus G5024 shall it be G2071 (FutInd) in the day G3739 G2250 when the Son G5207 of man G0444 is revealed G0601 (PresPasInd).
017:031 In G1722 that G1565 day G2250, he which G3739 shall be G2071 (FutInd) upon G1909 the housetop G1430, and G2532 his G0846 stuff G4632 in G1722 the house G3614, let G2597 him not G3361 come down G2597 (Aor2ActImpr) to take G0142 it G0846 away G0142 (AorActInf): and G2532 he that is in G1722 the field G0068, let him G1994 likewise G3668 not G3361 return G1994 (AorActImpr) back G1519 G3694.
017:032 Remember G3421 (PresActImpr) Lot’s G3091 wife G1135.
017:033 Whosoever G3739 G1437 shall seek G2212 (AorActSubj) to save G4982 (AorActInf) his G0846 life G5590 shall lose G0622 (FutActInd) it G0846; and G2532 whosoever G3739 G1437 shall lose G0622 (AorActSubj) his G0846 life shall preserve G2225 (FutActInd) it G0846.
017:034 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213, in that G5026 night G3571 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) two G1417 [men] in G1909 one G3391 bed G2825; the one G1520 shall be taken G3880 (FutPasInd), and G2532 the other G2087 shall be left G0863 (FutPasInd).
017:035 Two G1417 [women] shall be G2071 (FutInd) grinding G0229 (PresActPtc) together G0846 G1909; the one G3391 shall be taken G3880 (FutPasInd), and G2532 the other G2087 left G0863 (FutPasInd).
017:036 Two G1417 [men] shall be G2071 (FutInd) in G1722 the field G0068; the one G1520 shall be taken G3880 (FutPasInd), and G2532 the other G2087 left G0863 (FutPasInd).
017:037 And G2532 they answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Where G4226, Lord G2962? And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Wheresoever G3699 the body G4983 [is], thither G1563 will G4863 the eagles G0105 be gathered together G4863 (FutPasInd).
018:001 ¶  And G1161 he spake G3004 (ImpfActInd) G2532 a parable G3850 unto them G0846 G4314 [to this end], that men ought G1163 (PresInf) always G3842 to pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepInf), and G2532 not G3361 to faint G1573 (PresActInf);
018:002 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), There was G2258 (ImpfInd) in G1722 a G5100 city G4172 a G5100 judge G2923, which feared G5399 (PresMidPasDepPtc) not G3361 God G2316, neither G2532 G3361 regarded G1788 (PresPasPtc) man G0444:
018:003 And G1161 there was G2258 (ImpfInd) a widow G5503 in G1722 that G1565 city G4172; and G2532 she came G2064 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) unto G4314 him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Avenge G1556 (AorActImpr) me G3165 of G0575 mine G3450 adversary G0476.
018:004 And G2532 he would G2309 (AorActInd) not G3756 for G1909 a while G5550: but G1161 afterward G5023 G3326 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) within G1722 himself G1438, Though G1499 I fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepInd) not G3756 God G2316, nor G2532 G3756 regard G1788 (PresPasInd) man G0444;
018:005 Yet G1065 because G1223 this G5026 widow G5503 troubleth G3930 (PresActInf) G2873 me G3427, I will avenge G1556 (FutActInd) her G0846, lest G3363 by G1519 her continual G5056 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) she weary G5299 (PresActSubj) me G3165.
018:006 And G1161 the Lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Hear G0191 (AorActImpr) what G5101 the unjust G0093 judge G2923 saith G3004 (PresActInd).
018:007 And G1161 shall G1557 not G3364 God G2316 avenge G4160 (FutActInd) G1557 his own G0846 elect G1588, which G3588 cry G0994 (PresActPtc) day G2250 and G2532 night G3571 unto G4314 him G0846, though G2532 he bear long G3114 (PresActPtc) with G1909 them G0846?
018:008 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213 that G3754 he will G4160 (FutActInd) avenge G1557 them G0846 speedily G5034 G1722. Nevertheless G4133 when G0687 the Son G5207 of man G0444 cometh G2064 (Aor2ActPtc), shall he find G2147 (FutActInd) faith G4102 on G1909 the earth G1093?
018:009 And G1161 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) G2532 this G5026 parable G3850 unto G4314 certain G5100 which G3588 trusted G3982 (Perf2ActPtc) in G1909 themselves G1438 that G3754 they were G1526 (PresInd) righteous G1342, and G2532 despised G1848 (PresActPtc) others G3062:
018:010 Two G1417 men G0444 went up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1519 the temple G2411 to pray G4336 (AorMidDepInf); the one G1520 a Pharisee G5330, and G2532 the other G2087 a publican G5057.
018:011 The Pharisee G5330 stood G2476 (AorPasPtc) and prayed G4336 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) thus G5023 with G4314 himself G1438, God G2316, I thank G2168 (PresActInd) thee G4671, that G3754 I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756 as G5618 other G3062 men G0444 [are], extortioners G0727, unjust G0094, adulterers G3432, or G2228 even G2532 as G5613 this G3778 publican G5057.
018:012 I fast G3522 (PresActInd) twice G1364 in the week G4521, I give tithes G0586 (PresActInd) of all G3956 that G3745 I possess G2932 (PresMidPasDepInd).
018:013 And G2532 the publican G5057, standing G2476 (PerfActPtc) afar off G3113, would G2309 (ImpfActInd) not G3756 lift up G1869 (AorActInf) so much as G3761 [his] eyes G3788 unto G1519 heaven G3772, but G0235 smote G5180 (ImpfActInd) upon G1519 his G0846 breast G4738, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), God G2316 be merciful G2433 (AorPasImpr) to me G3427 a sinner G0268.
018:014 I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213, this man G3778 went down G2597 (Aor2ActInd) to G1519 his G0846 house G3624 justified G1344 (PerfPasPtc) [rather] than G2228 the other G1565: for G3754 every one G3956 that exalteth G5312 (PresActPtc) himself G1438 shall be abased G5013 (FutPasInd); and G1161 he that humbleth G5013 (PresActPtc) himself G1438 shall be exalted G5312 (FutPasInd).
018:015 And G1161 they brought G4374 (ImpfActInd) unto him G0846 also G2532 infants G1025, that G2443 he would touch G0680 (PresMidSubj) them G0846: but G1161 when [his] disciples G3101 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], they rebuked G2008 (AorActInd) them G0846.
018:016 But G1161 Jesus G2424 called G4341 (AorMidDepPtc) them G0846 [unto him], and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Suffer G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) little children G3813 to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInf) unto G4314 me G3165, and G2532 forbid G2967 (PresActImpr) them G0846 not G3361: for G1063 of such G5108 is G2076 (PresInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
018:017 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, Whosoever G3739 shall G1209 not G3362 receive G1209 (AorMidDepSubj) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 as G5613 a little child G3813 shall G1525 in no wise G3364 enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) therein G1519 G0846.
018:018 And G2532 a certain G5100 ruler G0758 asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Good G0018 Master G1320, what G5101 shall I do G4160 (AorActPtc) to inherit G2816 (FutActInd) eternal G0166 life G2222?
018:019 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Why G5101 callest thou G3004 (PresActInd) me G3165 good G0018? none G3762 [is] good G0018, save G1508 one G1520, [that is], God G2316.
018:020 Thou knowest G1492 (PerfActInd) the commandments G1785, Do G3431 not G3361 commit adultery G3431 (AorActSubj), Do G5407 not G3361 kill G5407 (AorActSubj), Do G2813 not G3361 steal G2813 (AorActSubj), Do G5576 not G3361 bear false witness G5576 (AorActSubj), Honour G5091 (PresActImpr) thy G4675 father G3962 and G2532 thy G4675 mother G3384.
018:021 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), All G3956 these G5023 have I kept G5442 (AorMidInd) from G1537 my G3450 youth G3503 up.
018:022 Now G1161 when Jesus G2424 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) these things G5023, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Yet G2089 lackest G3007 (PresActInd) thou G4671 one G1520 thing: sell G4453 (AorActImpr) all G3956 that G3745 thou hast G2192 (PresActInd), and G2532 distribute G1239 (Aor2ActImpr) unto the poor G4434, and G2532 thou shalt have G2192 (FutActInd) treasure G2344 in G1722 heaven G3772: and G2532 come G1204 (Impr), follow G0190 (PresActImpr) me G3427.
018:023 And G1161 when he heard G0191 (AorActPtc) this G5023, he was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) very sorrowful G4036: for G1063 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) very G4970 rich G4145.
018:024 And G1161 when Jesus G2424 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) that he G0846 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) very sorrowful G4036, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), How G4459 hardly G1423 shall they G1525 that have G2192 (PresActPtc) riches G5536 enter G1525 (FutMidDepInd) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316!
018:025 For G1063 it is G2076 (PresInd) easier G2123 for a camel G2574 to go G1525 (Aor2ActInf) through G1223 a needle’s G4476 eye G5168, than G2228 for a rich man G4145 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
018:026 And G1161 they that heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it] said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Who G5101 then G2532 can be G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) saved G4982 (AorPasInf)?
018:027 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), The things which are impossible G0102 with G3844 men G0444 are G2076 (PresInd) possible G1415 with G3844 God G2316.
018:028 Then G1161 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), we G2249 have left G0863 (AorActInd) all G3956, and G2532 followed G0190 (AorActInd) thee G4671.
018:029 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 There is G2076 (PresInd) no man G3762 that G3739 hath left G0863 (AorActInd) house G3614, or G2228 parents G1118, or G2228 brethren G0080, or G2228 wife G1135, or G2228 children G5043, for G1752 the kingdom G0932 of God’s G2316 sake G1752,
018:030 Who G3739 shall G0618 not G3364 receive G0618 (Aor2ActSubj) manifold more G4179 in G1722 this G5129 present time G2540, and G2532 in G1722 the world G0165 to come G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) life G2222 everlasting G0166.
018:031 Then G1161 he took G3880 (Aor2ActPtc) [unto him] the twelve G1427, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), we go up G0305 (PresActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414, and G2532 all things G3956 that are written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) by G1223 the prophets G4396 concerning the Son G5207 of man G0444 shall be accomplished G5055 (FutPasInd).
018:032 For G1063 he shall be delivered G3860 (FutPasInd) unto the Gentiles G1484, and G2532 shall be mocked G1702 (FutPasInd), and G2532 spitefully entreated G5195 (FutPasInd), and G2532 spitted on G1716 (FutPasInd):
018:033 And G2532 they shall scourge G3146 (AorActPtc) [him], and put G0615 him G0846 to death G0615 (FutActInd): and G2532 the third G5154 day G2250 he shall rise again G0450 (FutMidInd).
018:034 And G2532 they G0846 understood G4920 (AorActInd) none G3762 of these things G5130: and G2532 this G5124 saying G4487 was G2258 (ImpfInd) hid G2928 (PerfPasPtc) from G0575 them G0846, G2532 neither G3756 knew they G1097 (ImpfActInd) the things which were spoken G3004 (PresPasPtc).
018:035 And G1161 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that as G1722 he G0846 was come nigh G1448 (PresActInf) unto G1519 Jericho G2410, a certain G5100 blind man G5185 sat G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) by G3844 the way side G3598 begging G4319 (PresActPtc):
018:036 And G1161 hearing G0191 (AorActPtc) the multitude G3793 pass by G1279 (PresMidPasDepPtc), he asked G4441 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) what G5101 it G5124 meant G1498 (PresOpt).
018:037 And G1161 they told G0518 (AorActInd) him G0846, that G3754 Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480 passeth by G3928 (PresMidPasDepInd).
018:038 And G2532 he cried G0994 (AorActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Jesus G2424, [thou] Son G5207 of David G1138, have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on me G3165.
018:039 And G2532 they which went before G4254 (PresActPtc) rebuked G2008 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, that G2443 he should hold his peace G4623 (AorActSubj): but G1161 he G0846 cried G2896 (ImpfActInd) so much G4183 the more G3123, [Thou] Son G5207 of David G1138, have mercy G1653 (AorActImpr) on me G3165.
018:040 And G1161 Jesus G2424 stood G2476 (AorPasPtc), and commanded G2753 (AorActInd) him G0846 to be brought G0071 (AorPasInf) unto G4314 him G0846: and G1161 when he G0846 was come near G1448 (AorActPtc), he asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846,
018:041 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), What G5101 wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd) that I shall do G4160 (AorActSubj) unto thee G4671? And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, that G2443 I may receive my sight G0308 (AorActSubj).
018:042 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Receive thy sight G0308 (AorActImpr): thy G4675 faith G4102 hath saved G4982 (PerfActInd) thee G4571.
018:043 And G2532 immediately G3916 he received his sight G0308 (AorActInd), and G2532 followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, glorifying G1392 (PresActPtc) God G2316: and G2532 all G3956 the people G2992, when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], gave G1325 (AorActInd) praise G0136 unto God G2316.
019:001 ¶  And G2532 [Jesus] entered G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) and passed through G1330 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) Jericho G2410.
019:002 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), [there was] a man G0435 named G3686 G2564 (PresPasPtc) Zacchaeus G2195, which G2532 G0846 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the chief among the publicans G0754, and G2532 he G3778 was G2258 (ImpfInd) rich G4145.
019:003 And G2532 he sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) Jesus G2424 who G5101 he was G2076 (PresInd); and G2532 could G1410 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) not G3756 for G0575 the press G3793, because G3754 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) little G3398 of stature G2244.
019:004 And G2532 he ran G4390 (Aor2ActPtc) before G1715, and climbed up G0305 (Aor2ActInd) into G1909 a sycomore tree G4809 to G2443 see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) him G0846: for G3754 he was G3195 (ImpfActInd) to pass G1330 (PresMidPasDepInf) G1223 that G1565 [way].
019:005 And G2532 when G5613 Jesus G2424 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to G1909 the place G5117, he looked up G0308 (AorActPtc), and saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Zacchaeus G2195, make haste G4692 (AorActPtc), and come down G2597 (Aor2ActImpr); for G1063 to day G4594 I G3165 must G1163 (PresInd) abide G3306 (AorActInf) at G1722 thy G4675 house G3624.
019:006 And G2532 he made haste G4692 (AorActPtc), and came down G2597 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 received G5264 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846 joyfully G5463 (PresActPtc).
019:007 And G2532 when they saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], they G1234 all G0537 murmured G1234 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), That G3754 he was gone G1525 (Aor2ActInd) to be guest G2647 (AorActInf) with G3844 a man G0435 that is a sinner G0268.
019:008 And G1161 Zacchaeus G2195 stood G2476 (AorPasPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the Lord G2962; Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), Lord G2962, the half G2255 of my G3450 goods G5224 (PresActPtc) I give G1325 (PresActInd) to the poor G4434; and G2532 if G1536 I have taken G4811 any thing G1536 from any man G5100 by false accusation G4811 (AorActInd), I restore G0591 (PresActInd) [him] fourfold G5073.
019:009 And G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, G3754 This day G4594 is G1096 salvation G4991 come G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) to this G5129 house G3624, forsomuch as G2530 he G0846 also G2532 is G2076 (PresInd) a son G5207 of Abraham G0011.
019:010 For G1063 the Son G5207 of man G0444 is come G2064 (Aor2ActInd) to seek G2212 (AorActInf) and G2532 to save G4982 (AorActInf) that which was lost G0622 (Perf2ActPtc).
019:011 And G1161 as they G0846 heard G0191 (PresActPtc) these things G5023, he added G4369 (Aor2ActPtc) and spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) a parable G3850, because G1223 he G0846 was G1511 (PresInf) nigh G1451 to Jerusalem G2419, and G2532 because they G0846 thought G1380 (PresActInf) that G3754 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 should G3195 (PresActInd) immediately G3916 appear G0398 (PresPasInf).
019:012 He said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) therefore G3767, A certain G5100 nobleman G0444 G2104 went G4198 (AorPasDepInd) into G1519 a far G3117 country G5561 to receive G2983 (Aor2ActInf) for himself G1438 a kingdom G0932, and G2532 to return G5290 (AorActInf).
019:013 And G1161 he called G2564 (AorActPtc) his G1438 ten G1176 servants G1401, and delivered G1325 (AorActInd) them G0846 ten G1176 pounds G3414, and G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Occupy G4231 (AorMidDepImpr) till G2193 I come G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd).
019:014 But G1161 his G0846 citizens G4177 hated G3404 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, and G2532 sent G0649 (AorActInd) a message G4242 after G3694 him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), We will G2309 not G3756 have G2309 (PresActInd) this G5126 [man] to reign G0936 (AorActInf) over G1909 us G2248.
019:015 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that when G1722 he G0846 was returned G1880 (Aor2ActInf), having received G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) the kingdom G0932, then G2532 he commanded G2036 (Aor2ActInd) these G5128 servants G1401 to be called G5455 (AorPasInf) unto him G0846, to whom G3739 he had given G1325 (AorActInd) the money G0694, that G2443 he might know G1097 (Aor2ActSubj) how much G5101 every man G5101 had gained by trading G1281 (AorMidDepInd).
019:016 Then G1161 came G3854 (Aor2MidDepInd) the first G4413, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, thy G4675 pound G3414 hath gained G4333 (AorMidDepInd) ten G1176 pounds G3414.
019:017 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Well G2095, thou good G0018 servant G1401: because G3754 thou hast been G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) faithful G4103 in G1722 a very little G1646, have G2192 (PresActPtc) thou authority G2468 (PresImpr) G1849 over G1883 ten G1176 cities G4172.
019:018 And G2532 the second G1208 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, thy G4675 pound G3414 hath gained G4160 (AorActInd) five G4002 pounds G3414.
019:019 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) likewise G2532 to him G5129, Be G1096 (PresMidPasDepImpr) thou G4771 also G2532 over G1883 five G4002 cities G4172.
019:020 And G2532 another G2087 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Lord G2962, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), [here is] thy G4675 pound G3414, which G3739 I have G2192 (ImpfActInd) kept laid up G0606 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 a napkin G4676:
019:021 For G1063 I feared G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) thee G4571, because G3754 thou art G1488 (PresInd) an austere G0840 man G0444: thou takest up G0142 (PresActInd) that G3739 thou layedst G5087 not G3756 down G5087 (AorActInd), and G2532 reapest G2325 (PresActInd) that G3739 thou didst G4687 not G3756 sow G4687 (AorActInd).
019:022 And G1161 he saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto him G0846, Out of G1537 thine own G4675 mouth G4750 will I judge G2919 (FutActInd) thee G4571, [thou] wicked G4190 servant G1401. Thou knewest G1492 (PlupfActInd) that G3754 I G1473 was G1510 (PresInd) an austere G0840 man G0444, taking up G0142 (PresActPtc) that G3739 I laid G5087 not G3756 down G5087 (AorActInd), and G2532 reaping G2325 (PresActPtc) that G3739 I did G4687 not G3756 sow G4687 (AorActInd):
019:023 Wherefore G1302 then G2532 gavest G1325 not G3756 thou G1325 (AorActInd) my G3450 money G0694 into G1909 the bank G5132, that G2532 at my coming G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) I G1473 might G0302 have required G4238 (AorActInd) mine own G0846 with G4862 usury G5110?
019:024 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them that stood by G3936 (PerfActPtc), Take G0142 (AorActImpr) from G0575 him G0846 the pound G3414, and G2532 give G1325 (Aor2ActImpr) [it] to him that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) ten G1176 pounds G3414.
019:025 (And G2532 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, he hath G2192 (PresActInd) ten G1176 pounds G3414.)
019:026 For G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, That G3754 unto every one G3956 which G3588 hath G2192 (PresActPtc) shall be given G1325 (FutPasInd); and G1161 from G0575 him that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) not G3361, even G2532 that G3739 he hath G2192 (PresActInd) shall be taken away G0142 (FutPasInd) from G0575 him G0846.
019:027 But G4133 those G1565 mine G3450 enemies G2190, which G3588 would G2309 (AorActPtc) not G3361 that I G3165 should reign G0936 (AorActInf) over G1909 them G0846, bring G0071 (Aor2ActImpr) hither G5602, and G2532 slay G2695 (AorActImpr) [them] before G1715 me G3450.
019:028 And G2532 when he had thus G5023 spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), he went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) before G1715, ascending up G0305 (PresActPtc) to G1519 Jerusalem G2414.
019:029 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), when G5613 he was come nigh G1448 (AorActInd) to G1519 Bethphage G0967 and G2532 Bethany G0963, at G4314 the mount G3735 called G2564 (PresPasPtc) [the mount] of Olives G1636, he sent G0649 (AorActInd) two G1417 of his G0846 disciples G3101,
019:030 Saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), Go ye G5217 (PresActImpr) into G1519 the village G2968 over against G2713 [you]; in G1722 the which G3739 at your entering G1531 (PresMidPasDepPtc) ye shall find G2147 (FutActInd) a colt G4454 tied G1210 (PerfPasPtc), whereon G1909 G3739 yet never G3762 man G0444 sat G2523 (AorActInd) G4455: loose G3089 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and bring G0071 (Aor2ActImpr) [him hither].
019:031 And G2532 if G1437 any man G5100 ask G2065 (PresActSubj) you G5209, Why G1302 do ye loose G3089 (PresActInd) [him]? thus G3779 shall ye say G2046 (FutActInd) unto him G0846, Because G3754 the Lord G2962 hath G2192 (PresActInd) need G5532 of him G0846.
019:032 And G1161 they that were sent G0649 (PerfPasPtc) went their way G0565 (Aor2ActPtc), and found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) even as G2531 he had said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846.
019:033 And G1161 as they G0846 were loosing G3089 (PresActPtc) the colt G4454, the owners G2962 thereof G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Why G5101 loose ye G3089 (PresActInd) the colt G4454?
019:034 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), The Lord G2962 hath G2192 (PresActInd) need G5532 of him G0846.
019:035 And G2532 they brought G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 to G4314 Jesus G2424: and G2532 they cast G1977 their G1438 garments G2440 upon G1909 G1977 the colt G4454, and G1977 (AorActPtc) they set G1913 Jesus G2424 thereon G1913 (AorActInd).
019:036 And G1161 as he G0846 went G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc), they spread G5291 (ImpfActInd) their G0846 clothes G2440 in G1722 the way G3598.
019:037 And when he G0846 was come nigh G1448 (PresActPtc), even G1161 now G2235 at G4314 the descent G2600 of the mount G3735 of Olives G1636, the whole G0537 multitude G4128 of the disciples G3101 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to rejoice G5463 (PresActPtc) and praise G0134 (PresActInf) God G2316 with a loud G3173 voice G5456 for G4012 all G3956 the mighty works G1411 that G3739 they had seen G1492 (Aor2ActInd);
019:038 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Blessed G2127 (PerfPasPtc) [be] the King G0935 that cometh G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 the name G3686 of the Lord G2962: peace G1515 in G1722 heaven G3772, and G2532 glory G1391 in G1722 the highest G5310.
019:039 And G2532 some G5100 of the Pharisees G5330 from G0575 among the multitude G3793 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Master G1320, rebuke G2008 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 disciples G3101.
019:040 And G2532 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, I tell G3004 (PresActInd) you G5213 that G3754, if G1437 these G3778 should hold their peace G4623 (AorActSubj), the stones G3037 would immediately cry out G2896 (Fut2MidDepInd).
019:041 And G2532 when G5613 he was come near G1448 (AorActInd), he beheld G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) the city G4172, and wept G2799 (AorActInd) over G1909 it G0846,
019:042 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), If G3754 G1487 thou hadst known G1097 (Aor2ActInd), even G2532 thou G4771, at least G2534 in G1722 this G5026 thy G4675 day G2250, the things G3588 [which belong] unto G4314 thy G4675 peace G1515! but G1161 now G3568 they are hid G2928 (Aor2PasDepSubj) from G0575 thine G4675 eyes G3788.
019:043 For G3754 the days G2250 shall come G2240 (FutActInd) upon G1909 thee G4571, that G2532 thine G4675 enemies G2190 shall cast G4016 a trench G5482 about G4016 (FutActInd) thee G4671, and G2532 compass G4033 thee G4571 round G4033 (FutActInd), and G2532 keep G4912 thee G4571 in G4912 (FutActInd) on every side G3840,
019:044 And G2532 shall lay G1474 thee G4571 even with the ground G1474 (FutActInd), and G2532 thy G4675 children G5043 within G1722 thee G4671; and G2532 they shall G0863 not G3756 leave G0863 (FutActInd) in G1722 thee G4671 one stone G3037 upon G1909 another G3037; because G0473 G3739 thou knewest G1097 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 the time G2540 of thy G4675 visitation G1984.
019:045 And G2532 he went G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the temple G2411, and began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to cast out G1544 (PresActInf) them that sold G4453 (PresActPtc) therein G1722 G0846, and G2532 them that bought G0059 (PresActPtc);
019:046 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc) unto them G0846, It is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), My G3450 house G3624 is G2076 (PresInd) the house G3624 of prayer G4335: but G1161 ye G5210 have made G4160 (AorActInd) it G0846 a den G4693 of thieves G3027.
019:047 And G2532 he taught G2258 (ImpfInd) G1321 (PresActPtc) daily G2596 G2250 in G1722 the temple G2411. But G1161 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the scribes G1122 and G2532 the chief G4413 of the people G2992 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) to destroy G0622 (AorActInf) him G0846,
019:048 And G2532 could G2147 not G3756 find G2147 (ImpfActInd) what G5101 they might do G4160 (AorActSubj): for G1063 all G0537 the people G2992 were very attentive G1582 (ImpfMidInd) to hear G0191 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
020:001 ¶  And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), [that] on G1722 one G3391 of those G1565 days G2250, as he G0846 taught G1321 (PresActPtc) the people G2992 in G1722 the temple G2411, and G2532 preached the gospel G2097 (PresMidPtc), the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the scribes G1122 came upon G2186 (Aor2ActInd) [him] with G4862 the elders G4245,
020:002 And G2532 spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254, by G1722 what G4169 authority G1849 doest thou G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023? or G2228 who G5101 is he G2076 (PresInd) that gave G1325 (Aor2ActPtc) thee G4671 this G5026 authority G1849?
020:003 And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, I G2504 will G2065 also G2504 ask G2065 (FutActInd) you G5209 one G1520 thing G3056; and G2532 answer G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) me G3427:
020:004 The baptism G0908 of John G2491, was it G2258 (ImpfInd) from G1537 heaven G3772, or G2228 of G1537 men G0444?
020:005 And G1161 they reasoned G4817 (AorMidDepInd) with G4314 themselves G1438, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 If G1437 we shall say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), From G1537 heaven G3772; he will say G2046 (FutActInd), Why G1302 then G3767 believed ye G4100 (AorActInd) him G0846 not G3756?
020:006 But and G1161 if G1437 we say G2036 (Aor2ActSubj), Of G1537 men G0444; all G3956 the people G2992 will stone G2642 (FutActInd) us G2248: for G1063 they be G2076 (PresInd) persuaded G3982 (PerfPasPtc) that John G2491 was G1511 (PresInf) a prophet G4396.
020:007 And G2532 they answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd), that they could G1492 not G3361 tell G1492 (PerfActInf) whence G4159 [it was].
020:008 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Neither G3761 tell G3004 (PresActInd) I G1473 you G5213 by G1722 what G4169 authority G1849 I do G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023.
020:009 Then G1161 began he G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to speak G3004 (PresActInf) to G4314 the people G2992 this G5026 parable G3850; A certain G5100 man G0444 planted G5452 (AorActInd) a vineyard G0290, and G2532 let G1554 it G0846 forth G1554 (Aor2MidInd) to husbandmen G1092, and G2532 went into a far country G0589 (AorActInd) for a long G2425 time G5550.
020:010 And G2532 at G1722 the season G2540 he sent G0649 (AorActInd) a servant G1401 to G4314 the husbandmen G1092, that G2443 they should give G1325 (Aor2ActSubj) him G0846 of G0575 the fruit G2590 of the vineyard G0290: but G1161 the husbandmen G1092 beat G1194 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and sent [him] away G1821 (AorActInd) empty G2756.
020:011 And G2532 again G4369 (Aor2MidInd) he sent G3992 (AorActInf) another G2087 servant G1401: and G1161 they beat G1194 (AorActPtc) him also G2548, and G2532 entreated [him] shamefully G0818 (AorActPtc), and sent [him] away G1821 (AorActInd) empty G2756.
020:012 And G2532 again G4369 (Aor2MidInd) he sent G3992 (AorActInf) a third G5154: and G1161 they wounded G5135 (AorActPtc) him G5126 also G2532, and cast [him] out G1544 (Aor2ActInd).
020:013 Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) the lord G2962 of the vineyard G0290, What G5101 shall I do G4160 (AorActSubj)? I will send G3992 (FutActInd) my G3450 beloved G0027 son G5207: it may be G2481 they will reverence G1788 (Fut2PasInd) [him] when they see G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G5126.
020:014 But G1161 when the husbandmen G1092 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, they reasoned G1260 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) among G4314 themselves G1438, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) the heir G2818: come G1205 (Impr), let us kill G0615 (PresActSubj) him G0846, that G2443 the inheritance G2817 may be G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) ours G2257.
020:015 So G2532 they cast G1544 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 out of G1854 the vineyard G0290, and killed G0615 (AorActInd) [him]. What G5101 therefore G3767 shall G4160 the lord G2962 of the vineyard G0290 do G4160 (FutActInd) unto them G0846?
020:016 He shall come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) and G2532 destroy G0622 (FutActInd) these G5128 husbandmen G1092, and G2532 shall give G1325 (FutActInd) the vineyard G0290 to others G0243. And G1161 when they heard G0191 (AorActPtc) [it], they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), God forbid G3361 G1096 (Aor2MidDepOpt).
020:017 And G1161 he beheld G1689 (AorActPtc) them G0846, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 is G2076 (PresInd) this G5124 then G3767 that is written G1125 (PerfPasPtc), The stone G3037 which G3739 the builders G3618 (PresActPtc) rejected G0593 (AorActInd), the same G3778 is become G1096 (AorPasDepInd) the head G2776 of G1519 the corner G1137?
020:018 Whosoever G3956 shall fall G4098 (Aor2ActPtc) upon G1909 that G1565 stone G3037 shall be broken G4917 (FutPasInd); but G1161 on G1909 whomsoever G3739 G0302 it shall fall G4098 (Aor2ActSubj), it will grind G3039 him G0846 to powder G3039 (FutActInd).
020:019 And G2532 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the scribes G1122 the same G1722 G0846 hour G5610 sought G2212 (AorActInd) to lay G1911 (Aor2ActInf) hands G5495 on G1909 him G0846; and G2532 they feared G5399 (AorPasDepInd) the people G2992: for G1063 they perceived G1097 (Aor2ActInd) that G3754 he had spoken G2036 (Aor2ActInd) this G5026 parable G3850 against G4314 them G0846.
020:020 And G2532 they watched G3906 (AorActPtc) [him], and sent forth G0649 (AorActInd) spies G1455, which should feign G5271 (PresMidPasDepPtc) G1511 (PresInf) themselves G1438 just men G1342, that G2443 they might take hold G1949 (Aor2MidDepSubj) of his G0846 words G3056, that so G1519 they might deliver G3860 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846 unto the power G0746 and G2532 authority G1849 of the governor G2232.
020:021 And G2532 they asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, we know G1492 (PerfActInd) that G3754 thou sayest G3004 (PresActInd) and G2532 teachest G1321 (PresActInd) rightly G3723, G2532 neither G3756 acceptest thou G2983 (PresActInd) the person G4383 [of any], but G0235 teachest G1321 (PresActInd) the way G3598 of God G2316 truly G0225 G1909:
020:022 Is it lawful G1832 (PresInd) for us G2254 to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) tribute G5411 unto Caesar G2541, or G2228 no G3756?
020:023 But G1161 he perceived G2657 (AorActPtc) their G0846 craftiness G3834, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Why G5101 tempt ye G3985 (PresActInd) me G3165?
020:024 Shew G1925 (AorActImpr) me G3427 a penny G1220. Whose G5101 image G1504 and G2532 superscription G1923 hath it G2192 (PresActInd)? They answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Caesar’s G2541.
020:025 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Render G0591 (Aor2ActImpr) therefore G5106 unto Caesar G2541 the things which be G3588 Caesar’s G2541, and G2532 unto God G2316 the things which be G3588 God’s G2316.
020:026 And G2532 they could G2480 (AorActInd) not G3756 take hold G1949 (Aor2MidDepInf) of his G0846 words G4487 before G1726 the people G2992: and G2532 they marvelled G2296 (AorActPtc) at G1909 his G0846 answer G0612, and held their peace G4601 (AorActInd).
020:027 Then G1161 came G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) to [him] certain G5100 of the Sadducees G4523, which G3588 deny G0483 (PresActPtc) that there is G1511 (PresInf) any G3361 resurrection G0386; and they asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846,
020:028 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, Moses G3475 wrote G1125 (AorActInd) unto us G2254, If G1437 any man’s G5100 brother G0080 die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj), having G2192 (PresActPtc) a wife G1135, and G2532 he G3778 die G0599 (Aor2ActSubj) without children G0815, that G2443 his G0846 brother G0080 should take G2983 (Aor2ActSubj) his wife G1135, and G2532 raise up G1817 (AorActSubj) seed G4690 unto his G0846 brother G0080.
020:029 There were G2258 (ImpfInd) therefore G3767 seven G2033 brethren G0080: and G2532 the first G4413 took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) a wife G1135, and died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) without children G0815.
020:030 And G2532 the second G1208 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) her to wife G1135, and G2532 he G3778 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) childless G0815.
020:031 And G2532 the third G5154 took G2983 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846; and G1161 in like manner G5615 the seven G2033 also G2532: and they left G2641 (Aor2ActInd) no G3756 children G5043, and G2532 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd).
020:032 G1161 Last G5305 of all G3956 the woman G1135 died G0599 (Aor2ActInd) also G2532.
020:033 Therefore G3767 in G1722 the resurrection G0386 whose G5101 wife G1135 of them G0846 is she G1096 (PresMidPasDepInd)? for G1063 seven G2033 had G2192 (Aor2ActInd) her G0846 to wife G1135.
020:034 And G2532 Jesus G2424 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, The children G5207 of this G5127 world G0165 marry G1060 (PresActInd), and G2532 are given in marriage G1548 (PresPasInd):
020:035 But G1161 they which shall be accounted worthy G2661 (AorPasPtc) to obtain G5177 (Aor2ActInf) that G1565 world G0165, and G2532 the resurrection G0386 from G1537 the dead G3498, neither G3777 marry G1060 (PresActInd), nor G3777 are given in marriage G1548 (PresPasInd):
020:036 Neither G3777 G1063 can G1410 (PresMidPasDepInd) they die G0599 (Aor2ActInf) any more G2089: for G1063 they are G1526 (PresInd) equal unto the angels G2465; and G2532 are G1526 (PresInd) the children G5207 of God G2316, being G5607 (PresPtc) the children G5207 of the resurrection G0386.
020:037 Now G1161 that G3754 the dead G3498 are raised G1453 (PresPasInd), even G2532 Moses G3475 shewed G3377 (AorActInd) at G1909 the bush G0942, when G5613 he calleth G3004 (PresActInd) the Lord G2962 the God G2316 of Abraham G0011, and G2532 the God G2316 of Isaac G2464, and G2532 the God G2316 of Jacob G2384.
020:038 For G1161 he is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 a God G2316 of the dead G3498, but G0235 of the living G2198 (PresActPtc): for G1063 all G3956 live G2198 (PresActInd) unto him G0846.
020:039 Then G1161 certain G5100 of the scribes G1122 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Master G1320, thou hast well G2573 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd).
020:040 And G1161 after that G3765 they durst G5111 (ImpfActInd) not G3765 ask G1905 (PresActInf) him G0846 any G3762 [question at all].
020:041 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, How G4459 say G3004 (PresActInd) they that Christ G5547 is G1511 (PresInf) David’s G1138 son G5207?
020:042 And G2532 David G1138 himself G0846 saith G3004 (PresActInd) in G1722 the book G0976 of Psalms G5568, The LORD G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto my G3450 Lord G2962, Sit thou G2521 (PresMidPasDepImpr) on G1537 my G3450 right hand G1188,
020:043 Till G2193 G0302 I make G5087 (Aor2ActSubj) thine G4675 enemies G2190 thy G4675 footstool G4228 G5286.
020:044 David G1138 therefore G3767 calleth G2564 (PresActInd) him G0846 Lord G2962, how G4459 is he G2076 (PresInd) then G2532 his G0846 son G5207?
020:045 Then G1161 in the audience G0191 (PresActPtc) of all G3956 the people G2992 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto his G0846 disciples G3101,
020:046 Beware G4337 (PresActImpr) of G0575 the scribes G1122, which G3588 desire G2309 (PresActPtc) to walk G4043 (PresActInf) in G1722 long robes G4749, and G2532 love G5368 (PresActPtc) greetings G0783 in G1722 the markets G0058, and G2532 the highest seats G4410 in G1722 the synagogues G4864, and G2532 the chief rooms G4411 at G1722 feasts G1173;
020:047 Which G3739 devour G2719 (PresActInd) widows G5503 ’ houses G3614, and G2532 for a shew G4392 make G4336 long G3117 prayers G4336 (PresMidPasDepInd): the same G3778 shall receive G2983 (FutMidDepInd) greater G4055 damnation G2917.
021:001 ¶  And G1161 he looked up G0308 (AorActPtc), and saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) the rich men G4145 casting G0906 (PresActPtc) their G0846 gifts G1435 into G1519 the treasury G1049.
021:002 And G1161 he saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) also G2532 a certain G5100 poor G3998 widow G5503 casting G0906 (PresActPtc) in thither G1563 two G1417 mites G3016.
021:003 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Of a truth G0230 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 this G3778 poor G4434 widow G5503 hath cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) in more than G4119 they all G3956:
021:004 For G1063 all G0537 these G3778 have of G1537 their G0846 abundance G4052 (PresActPtc) cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) in unto G1519 the offerings G1435 of God G2316: but G1161 she G3778 G0846 of G1537 her G0846 penury G5303 hath cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) in all G0537 the living G0979 that G3739 she had G2192 (ImpfActInd).
021:005 And G2532 as some G5100 spake G3004 (PresActPtc) of G4012 the temple G2411, how G3754 it was adorned G2885 (PerfPasInd) with goodly G2570 stones G3037 and G2532 gifts G0334, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd),
021:006 [As for] these things G5023 which G3739 ye behold G2334 (PresActInd), the days G2250 will come G2064 (FutMidDepInd), in G1722 the which G3739 there shall G0863 not G3756 be left G0863 (FutPasInd) one stone G3037 upon G1909 another G3037, that G3739 shall G2647 not G3756 be thrown down G2647 (FutPasInd).
021:007 And G1161 they asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Master G1320, but G3767 when G4219 shall G2071 these things G5023 be G2071 (FutInd)? and G2532 what G5101 sign G4592 [will there be] when G3752 these things G5023 shall G3195 (PresActSubj) come to pass G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf)?
021:008 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Take heed G0991 (PresActImpr) that ye be G4105 not G3361 deceived G4105 (AorPasSubj): for G1063 many G4183 shall come G2064 (FutMidDepInd) in G1909 my G3450 name G3686, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) [Christ]; and G2532 the time G2540 draweth near G1448 (PerfActInd): go ye G4198 (AorPasDepSubj) not G3361 therefore G3767 after G3694 them G0846.
021:009 But G1161 when G3752 ye shall hear G0191 (AorActSubj) of wars G4171 and G2532 commotions G0181, be G4422 not G3361 terrified G4422 (AorPasSubj): for G1063 these things G5023 must G1163 (PresInd) first G4412 come to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf); but G0235 the end G5056 [is] not G3756 by and by G2112.
021:010 Then G5119 said he G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846, Nation G1484 shall rise G1453 (FutPasInd) against G1909 nation G1484, and G2532 kingdom G0932 against G1909 kingdom G0932:
021:011 And G5037 great G3173 earthquakes G4578 shall be G2071 (FutInd) in G2596 divers places G5117, and G2532 famines G3042, and G2532 pestilences G3061; and G5037 fearful sights G5400 and G2532 great G3173 signs G4592 shall there be G2071 (FutInd) from G0575 heaven G3772.
021:012 But G1161 before G4253 all G0537 these G5130, they shall lay G1911 (FutActInd) their G0846 hands G5495 on G1909 you G5209, and G2532 persecute G1377 (FutActInd) [you], delivering G3860 (PresActPtc) [you] up G1519 to the synagogues G4864, and G2532 into prisons G5438, being brought G0071 (PresPasPtc) before G1909 kings G0935 and G2532 rulers G2232 for G1752 my G3450 name’s G3686 sake G1752.
021:013 And G1161 it shall turn G0576 (FutMidDepInd) to you G5213 for G1519 a testimony G3142.
021:014 Settle G5087 (Aor2MidImpr) [it] therefore G3767 in G1519 your G5216 hearts G2588, not G3361 to meditate before G4304 (PresActInf) what ye shall answer G0626 (AorPasDepInf):
021:015 For G1063 I G1473 will give G1325 (FutActInd) you G5213 a mouth G4750 and G2532 wisdom G4678, which G3739 all G3956 your G5213 adversaries G0480 (PresMidPasDepPtc) shall G1410 not G3756 be able G1410 (FutMidDepInd) to gainsay G0471 (Aor2ActInf) nor G3761 resist G0436 (Aor2ActInf).
021:016 And G1161 ye shall be betrayed G3860 (FutPasInd) both G2532 by G5259 parents G1118, and G2532 brethren G0080, and G2532 kinsfolks G4773, and G2532 friends G5384; and G2532 [some] of G1537 you G5216 shall they cause to be put to death G2289 (FutActInd).
021:017 And G2532 ye shall be G2071 (FutInd) hated G3404 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 all G3956 [men] for G1223 my G3450 name’s sake G3686.
021:018 But G2532 there shall not G3364 an hair G2359 of G1537 your G5216 head G2776 perish G0622 (Aor2MidSubj).
021:019 In G1722 your G5216 patience G5281 possess ye G2932 (AorMidDepImpr) your G5216 souls G5590.
021:020 And G1161 when G3752 ye shall see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) Jerusalem G2419 compassed G2944 (PresPasPtc) with G5259 armies G4760, then G5119 know G1097 (Aor2ActImpr) that G3754 the desolation G2050 thereof G0846 is nigh G1448 (PerfActInd).
021:021 Then G5119 let them G5343 which are in G1722 Judaea G2449 flee G5343 (PresActImpr) to G1519 the mountains G3735; and G2532 let them G1633 which are in G1722 the midst G3319 of it G0846 depart out G1633 (PresActImpr); and G2532 let G1525 not G3361 them that are in G1722 the countries G5561 enter G1525 (PresMidPasDepImpr) thereinto G1519 G0846.
021:022 For G3754 these G3778 be G1526 (PresInd) the days G2250 of vengeance G1557, that all things G3956 which G3588 are written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) may be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasInf).
021:023 But G1161 woe G3759 unto G1722 them that are with child G1064 G2192 (PresActPtc), and G2532 to them that give suck G2337 (PresActPtc), in G1722 those G1565 days G2250! for G1063 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) great G3173 distress G0318 in G1909 the land G1093, and G2532 wrath G3709 upon G1722 this G5129 people G2992.
021:024 And G2532 they shall fall G4098 (FutMidPasDepInd) by the edge G4750 of the sword G3162, and G2532 shall be led away captive G0163 (FutPasInd) into G1519 all G3956 nations G1484: and G2532 Jerusalem G2419 shall be G2071 (FutInd) trodden down G3961 (PresPasPtc) of G5259 the Gentiles G1484, until G0891 the times G2540 of the Gentiles G1484 be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj).
021:025 And G2532 there shall be G2071 (FutInd) signs G4592 in G1722 the sun G2246, and G2532 in the moon G4582, and G2532 in the stars G0798; and G2532 upon G1909 the earth G1093 distress G4928 of nations G1484, with G1722 perplexity G0640; the sea G2281 and G2532 the waves G4535 roaring G2278 (PresActPtc);
021:026 Men’s G0444 hearts failing them G0674 (PresActPtc) for G0575 fear G5401, and G2532 for looking after G4329 those things which are coming on G1904 (PresMidPasDepPtc) the earth G3625: for G1063 the powers G1411 of heaven G3772 shall be shaken G4531 (FutPasInd).
021:027 And G2532 then G5119 shall they see G3700 (FutMidDepInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444 coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) in G1722 a cloud G3507 with G3326 power G1411 and G2532 great G4183 glory G1391.
021:028 And G1161 when these things G5130 begin G0756 (PresMidPtc) to come to pass G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf), then look up G0352 (AorActImpr), and G2532 lift up G1869 (AorActImpr) your G5216 heads G2776; for G1360 your G5216 redemption G0629 draweth nigh G1448 (PresActInd).
021:029 And G2532 he spake G2036 (Aor2ActInd) to them G0846 a parable G3850; Behold G1492 (Aor2ActImpr) the fig tree G4808, and G2532 all G3956 the trees G1186;
021:030 When G3752 they now G2235 shoot forth G4261 (Aor2ActSubj), ye see G0991 (PresActPtc) and know G1097 (PresActInd) of G0575 your own selves G1438 that G3754 summer G2330 is G2076 (PresInd) now G2235 nigh at hand G1451.
021:031 So G3779 likewise G2532 ye G5210, when G3752 ye see G1492 (Aor2ActSubj) these things G5023 come to pass G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc), know ye G1097 (PresActImpr) that G3754 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 is G2076 (PresInd) nigh at hand G1451.
021:032 Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 This G3778 generation G1074 shall G3928 not G3364 pass away G3928 (Aor2ActSubj), G0302 till G2193 all G3956 be fulfilled G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj).
021:033 Heaven G3772 and G2532 earth G1093 shall pass away G3928 (FutMidDepInd): but G1161 my G3450 words G3056 shall G3928 not G3364 pass away G3928 (Aor2ActSubj).
021:034 And G1161 take heed G4337 (PresActImpr) to yourselves G1438, lest at any time G3379 your G5216 hearts G2588 be overcharged G0925 (AorPasSubj) with G1722 surfeiting G2897, and G2532 drunkenness G3178, and G2532 cares G3308 of this life G0982, and G2532 [so] that G1565 day G2250 come G2186 (Aor2ActSubj) upon G1909 you G5209 unawares G0160.
021:035 For G1063 as G5613 a snare G3803 shall it come G1904 (FutMidDepInd) on G1909 all G3956 them that dwell G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1909 the face G4383 of the whole G3956 earth G1093.
021:036 Watch ye G0069 (PresActImpr) therefore G3767, and pray G1189 (PresMidPasDepPtc) always G1722 G3956 G2540, that G2443 ye may be accounted worthy G2661 (AorPasSubj) to escape G1628 (Aor2ActInf) all G3956 these things G5023 that shall G3195 (PresActPtc) come to pass G1096 (PresMidPasDepInf), and G2532 to stand G2476 (AorPasInf) before G1715 the Son G5207 of man G0444.
021:037 And G1161 in the day time G2250 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) in G1722 the temple G2411; and G1161 at night G3571 he went out G1831 (PresMidPasDepPtc), and abode G0835 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) in G1519 the mount G3735 that is called G2564 (PresPasPtc) [the mount] of Olives G1636.
021:038 And G2532 all G3956 the people G2992 came early in the morning G3719 (ImpfActInd) to G4314 him G0846 in G1722 the temple G2411, for to hear G0191 (PresActInf) him G0846.
022:001 ¶  Now G1161 the feast G1859 of unleavened bread G0106 drew nigh G1448 (ImpfActInd), which is called G3004 (PresPasPtc) the Passover G3957.
022:002 And G2532 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 scribes G1122 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) how G4459 they might kill G0337 (AorActSubj) him G0846; for G1063 they feared G5399 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) the people G2992.
022:003 Then G1161 entered G1525 (Aor2ActInd) Satan G4567 into G1519 Judas G2455 surnamed G1941 (PresPasPtc) Iscariot G2469, being G5607 (PresPtc) of G1537 the number G0706 of the twelve G1427.
022:004 And G2532 he went his way G0565 (Aor2ActPtc), and communed with G4814 (AorActInd) the chief priests G0749 and G2532 captains G4755, how G4459 he might betray G3860 (Aor2ActSubj) him G0846 unto them G0846.
022:005 And G2532 they were glad G5463 (Aor2PasDepInd), and G2532 covenanted G4934 (Aor2MidInd) to give G1325 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846 money G0694.
022:006 And G2532 he promised G1843 (AorActInd), and G2532 sought G2212 (ImpfActInd) opportunity G2120 to betray G3860 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846 unto them G0846 in the absence G0817 of the multitude G3793.
022:007 Then G1161 came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) the day G2250 of unleavened bread G0106, when G1722 G3739 the passover G3957 must G1163 (ImpfInd) be killed G2380 (PresPasInf).
022:008 And G2532 he sent G0649 (AorActInd) Peter G4074 and G2532 John G2491, saying G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), Go G4198 (AorPasDepPtc) and prepare G2090 (AorActImpr) us G2254 the passover G3957, that G2443 we may eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj).
022:009 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Where G4226 wilt thou G2309 (PresActInd) that we prepare G2090 (AorActSubj)?
022:010 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), when ye G5216 are entered G1525 (Aor2ActPtc) into G1519 the city G4172, there shall G4876 a man G0444 meet G4876 (FutActInd) you G5213, bearing G0941 (PresActPtc) a pitcher G2765 of water G5204; follow G0190 (AorActImpr) him G0846 into G1519 the house G3614 where G3757 he entereth in G1531 (PresMidPasDepInd).
022:011 And G2532 ye shall say G2046 (FutActInd) unto the goodman G3617 of the house G3614, The Master G1320 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, Where G4226 is G2076 (PresInd) the guestchamber G2646, where G3699 I shall eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) the passover G3957 with G3326 my G3450 disciples G3101?
022:012 And G2548 he shall shew G1166 (FutActInd) you G5213 a large G3173 upper room G0508 furnished G4766 (PerfPasPtc): there G1563 make ready G2090 (AorActImpr).
022:013 And G1161 they went G0565 (Aor2ActPtc), and found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) as G2531 he had said G2046 (PerfActInd) unto them G0846: and G2532 they made ready G2090 (AorActInd) the passover G3957.
022:014 And G2532 when G3753 the hour G5610 was come G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), he sat down G0377 (Aor2ActInd), and G2532 the twelve G1427 apostles G0652 with G4862 him G0846.
022:015 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, With desire G1939 I have desired G1937 (AorActInd) to eat G5315 (Aor2ActInf) this G5124 passover G3957 with G3326 you G5216 before G4253 I G3165 suffer G3958 (Aor2ActInf):
022:016 For G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 I will G5315 not G3765 any more G3364 eat G5315 (Aor2ActSubj) thereof G0846 G1537, until G2193 G3755 it be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasSubj) in G1722 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
022:017 And G2532 he took G1209 (AorMidDepPtc) the cup G4221, and gave thanks G2168 (AorActPtc), and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Take G2983 (Aor2ActImpr) this G5124, and G2532 divide G1266 (AorActImpr) [it] among yourselves G1438:
022:018 For G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, G3754 I will G4095 not G3364 drink G4095 (Aor2ActSubj) of G0575 the fruit G1081 of the vine G0288, until G2193 G3755 the kingdom G0932 of God G2316 shall come G2064 (Aor2ActSubj).
022:019 And G2532 he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) bread G0740, and gave thanks G2168 (AorActPtc), and brake G2806 (AorActInd) [it], and G2532 gave G1325 (AorActInd) unto them G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This G5124 is G2076 (PresInd) my G3450 body G4983 which G3588 is given G1325 (PresPasPtc) for G5228 you G5216: this G5124 do G4160 (PresActImpr) in remembrance G0364 of G1519 me G1699.
022:020 Likewise G5615 also G2532 the cup G4221 after G3326 supper G1172 (AorActInf), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), This G5124 cup G4221 [is] the new G2537 testament G1242 in G1722 my G3450 blood G0129, which G3588 is shed G1632 (PresPasPtc) for G5228 you G5216.
022:021 But G4133, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the hand G5495 of him that betrayeth G3860 (PresActPtc) me G3165 [is] with G3326 me G1700 on G1909 the table G5132.
022:022 And G2532 truly G3303 the Son G5207 of man G0444 goeth G4198 (PresMidPasDepInd), as G2596 it was determined G3724 (PerfPasPtc): but G4133 woe G3759 unto that G1565 man G0444 by G1223 whom G3739 he is betrayed G3860 (PresPasInd)!
022:023 And G2532 they G0846 began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to enquire G4802 (PresActInf) among G4314 themselves G1438, which G5101 G0686 of G1537 them G0846 it was G1498 (PresOpt) that should G3195 (PresActPtc) do G4238 (PresActInf) this thing G5124.
022:024 And G1161 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) also G2532 a strife G5379 among G1722 them G0846, which G5101 of them G0846 should be accounted G1380 (PresActInd) G1511 (PresInf) the greatest G3187.
022:025 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, The kings G0935 of the Gentiles G1484 exercise lordship over G2961 (PresActInd) them G0846; and G2532 they that exercise authority upon G1850 (PresActPtc) them G0846 are called G2564 (PresPasInd) benefactors G2110.
022:026 But G1161 ye G5210 [shall] not G3756 [be] so G3779: but G0235 he that is greatest G3187 among G1722 you G5213, let him be G1096 (Aor2MidDepImpr) as G5613 the younger G3501; and G2532 he that is chief G2233 (PresMidPasDepPtc), as G5613 he that doth serve G1247 (PresActPtc).
022:027 For G1063 whether G5101 [is] greater G3187, he that sitteth at meat G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc), or G2228 he that serveth G1247 (PresActPtc)? [is] not G3780 he that sitteth at meat G0345 (PresMidPasDepPtc)? but G1161 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd) among G1722 G3319 you G5216 as G5613 he that serveth G1247 (PresActPtc).
022:028 G1161 Ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) they which have continued G1265 (PerfActPtc) with G3326 me G1700 in G1722 my G3450 temptations G3986.
022:029 And I G2504 appoint G1303 (PresMidInd) unto you G5213 a kingdom G0932, as G2531 my G3450 Father G3962 hath appointed G1303 (Aor2MidInd) unto me G3427;
022:030 That G2443 ye may eat G2068 (PresActSubj) and G2532 drink G4095 (PresActSubj) at G1909 my G3450 table G5132 in G1722 my G3450 kingdom G0932, and G2532 sit G2523 (AorMidDepSubj) on G1909 thrones G2362 judging G2919 (PresActPtc) the twelve G1427 tribes G5443 of Israel G2474.
022:031 And G1161 the Lord G2962 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Simon G4613, Simon G4613, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), Satan G4567 hath desired G1809 (AorMidInd) [to have] you G5209, that he may sift G4617 (AorActInf) [you] as G5613 wheat G4621:
022:032 But G1161 I G1473 have prayed G1189 (AorPasInd) for G4012 thee G4675, that G3363 thy G4675 faith G4102 fail G1587 (PresActSubj) not G3363: and G2532 when G4218 thou G4771 art converted G1994 (AorActPtc), strengthen G4741 (AorActImpr) thy G4675 brethren G0080.
022:033 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, I am G1510 (PresInd) ready G2092 to go G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) with G3326 thee G4675, both G2532 into G1519 prison G5438, and G2532 to G1519 death G2288.
022:034 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), I tell G3004 (PresActInd) thee G4671, Peter G4074, the cock G0220 shall G5455 not G3364 crow G5455 (FutActInd) this day G4594, before that G4250 thou shalt G2228 thrice G5151 deny G0533 (FutMidDepInd) that thou G3361 knowest G1492 (PerfActInf) me G3165.
022:035 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, When G3753 I sent G0649 (AorActInd) you G5209 without G0817 purse G0905, and G2532 scrip G4082, and G2532 shoes G5266, G3361 lacked ye G5302 (AorActInd) any thing G5100? And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Nothing G3762.
022:036 Then G3767 said he G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, But G0235 now G3568, he that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) a purse G0905, let him take G0142 (AorActImpr) [it], and G2532 likewise G3668 [his] scrip G4082: and G2532 he that hath G2192 (PresActPtc) no G3361 sword G3162, let him sell G4453 (AorActImpr) his G0846 garment G2440, and G2532 buy G0059 (FutActInd) one.
022:037 For G1063 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto you G5213, that G3754 this G5124 that is written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) must G1163 (PresInd) yet G2089 be accomplished G5055 (AorPasInf) in G1722 me G1698, And G2532 he was reckoned G3049 (AorPasInd) among G3326 the transgressors G0459: for G2532 G1063 the things concerning G4012 me G1700 have G2192 (PresActInd) an end G5056.
022:038 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Lord G2962, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), here G5602 [are] two G1417 swords G3162. And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, It is G2076 (PresInd) enough G2425.
022:039 And G2532 he came out G1831 (Aor2ActPtc), and went G4198 (AorPasDepInd), as G2596 he was wont G1485, to G1519 the mount G3735 of Olives G1636; and G1161 his G0846 disciples G3101 also G2532 followed G0190 (AorActInd) him G0846.
022:040 And G1161 when he was G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) at G1909 the place G5117, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr) that ye enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) not G3361 into G1519 temptation G3986.
022:041 And G2532 he G0846 was withdrawn G0645 (AorPasInd) from G0575 them G0846 about G5616 a stone’s G3037 cast G1000, and G2532 kneeled down G5087 (Aor2ActPtc) G1119, and prayed G4336 (ImpfMidPasDepInd),
022:042 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Father G3962, if G1487 thou be willing G1014 (PresMidPasDepInd), remove G3911 (Aor2ActInf) G3911 (Aor2ActImpr) this G5124 cup G4221 from G0575 me G1700: nevertheless G4133 not G3361 my G3450 will G2307, but G0235 thine G4674, be done G1096 (Aor2MidDepImpr).
022:043 And G1161 there appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) an angel G0032 unto him G0846 from G0575 heaven G3772, strengthening G1765 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
022:044 And G2532 being G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) in G1722 an agony G0074 he prayed G4336 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) more earnestly G1617: and G1161 his G0846 sweat G2402 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) as it were G5616 great drops G2361 of blood G0129 falling down G2597 (PresActPtc) to G1909 the ground G1093.
022:045 And G2532 when he rose up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) from G0575 prayer G4335, and was come G2064 (Aor2ActPtc) to G4314 his G0846 disciples G3101, he found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 sleeping G2837 (PresPasPtc) for G0575 sorrow G3077,
022:046 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 sleep ye G2518 (PresActInd)? rise G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) and pray G4336 (PresMidPasDepImpr), lest G3363 ye enter G1525 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1519 temptation G3986.
022:047 And G1161 while he G0846 yet G2089 spake G2980 (PresActPtc), behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr) a multitude G3793, and G2532 he that was called G3004 (PresPasPtc) Judas G2455, one G1520 of the twelve G1427, went before G4281 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) them G0846, and G2532 drew near G1448 (AorActInd) unto Jesus G2424 to kiss G5368 (AorActInf) him G0846.
022:048 But G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Judas G2455, betrayest thou G3860 (PresActInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444 with a kiss G5370?
022:049 When G1161 they which were about G4012 him G0846 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) what would follow G2071 (FutPtc), they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Lord G2962, G1487 shall we smite G3960 (FutActInd) with G1722 the sword G3162?
022:050 And G2532 one G1520 G5100 of G1537 them G0846 smote G3960 (AorActInd) the servant G1401 of the high priest G0749, and G2532 cut off G0851 (Aor2ActInd) his G0846 right G1188 ear G3775.
022:051 And G1161 Jesus G2424 answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Suffer ye G1439 (PresActImpr) thus G5127 far G2193. And G2532 he touched G0680 (AorMidPtc) his G0846 ear G5621, and healed G2390 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846.
022:052 Then G1161 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 the chief priests G0749, and G2532 captains G4755 of the temple G2411, and G2532 the elders G4245, which were come G3854 (Aor2MidDepPtc) to G1909 him G0846, Be ye come out G1831 (PerfActInd), as G5613 against G1909 a thief G3027, with G3326 swords G3162 and G2532 staves G3586?
022:053 When G5607 I G3450 was G5607 (PresPtc) daily G2250 G2596 with G3326 you G5216 in G1722 the temple G2411, ye stretched forth G1614 (AorActInd) no G3756 hands G5495 against G1909 me G1691: but G0235 this G3778 is G2076 (PresInd) your G5216 hour G5610, and G2532 the power G1849 of darkness G4655.
022:054 Then G1161 took they G4815 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and led G0071 (Aor2ActInd) [him], and G2532 brought G1521 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 into G1519 the high priest’s G0749 house G3624. And G1161 Peter G4074 followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) afar off G3113.
022:055 And G1161 when they G0846 had kindled G0681 (AorActPtc) a fire G4442 in G1722 the midst G3319 of the hall G0833, and G2532 were set down together G4776 (AorActPtc), Peter G4074 sat down G2521 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) among G3319 G1722 them G0846.
022:056 But G1161 a certain G5100 maid G3814 beheld G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 as he sat G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) by G4314 the fire G5457, and G2532 earnestly looked G0816 (AorActPtc) upon him G0846, and said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), This man G3778 was G2258 (ImpfInd) also G2532 with G4862 him G0846.
022:057 And G1161 he denied G0720 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Woman G1135, I know G1492 (PerfActInd) him G0846 not G3756.
022:058 And G2532 after G3326 a little while G1024 another G2087 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846, and said G5346 (ImpfInd), Thou G4771 art G1488 (PresInd) also G2532 of G1537 them G0846. And G1161 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Man G0444, I am G1510 (PresInd) not G3756.
022:059 And G2532 about G5616 the space G1339 (Aor2ActPtc) of one G3391 hour G5610 after another G0243 G5100 confidently affirmed G1340 (ImpfMidPasDepInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Of G1909 a truth G0225 this G3778 [fellow] also G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) with G3326 him G0846: for G1063 G2532 he is G2076 (PresInd) a Galilaean G1057.
022:060 And G1161 Peter G4074 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Man G0444, I know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G3739 thou sayest G3004 (PresActInd). And G2532 immediately G3916, while he G0846 yet G2089 spake G2980 (PresActPtc), the cock G0220 crew G5455 (AorActInd).
022:061 And G2532 the Lord G2962 turned G4762 (Aor2PasPtc), and looked upon G1689 (AorActInd) Peter G4074. And G2532 Peter G4074 remembered G5279 (AorActInd) the word G3056 of the Lord G2962, how G5613 he had said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Before G3754 G4250 the cock G0220 crow G5455 (AorActInf), thou shalt deny G0533 (FutMidDepInd) me G3165 thrice G5151.
022:062 And G2532 Peter G4074 went G1831 (Aor2ActPtc) out G1854, and wept G2799 (AorActInd) bitterly G4090.
022:063 And G2532 the men G0435 that held G4912 (PresActPtc) Jesus G2424 mocked G1702 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, and smote G1194 (PresActPtc) [him].
022:064 And G2532 when they had blindfolded G4028 (AorActPtc) him G0846, they struck G5180 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 on the face G4383, and G2532 asked G1905 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Prophesy G4395 (AorActImpr), who G5101 is it G2076 (PresInd) that smote G3817 (AorActPtc) thee G4571?
022:065 And G2532 many G4183 other things G2087 blasphemously G0987 (PresActPtc) spake they G3004 (ImpfActInd) against G1519 him G0846.
022:066 And G2532 as soon as G5613 it was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) day G2250, the elders G4244 of the people G2992 and G5037 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the scribes G1122 came together G4863 (AorPasInd), and G2532 led G0321 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 into G1519 their G1438 council G4892, saying G3004 (PresActPtc),
022:067 G1487 Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 the Christ G5547? tell G2036 (Aor2ActImpr) us G2254. And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, If G1437 I tell G2036 (Aor2ActSubj) you G5213, ye will G4100 not G3364 believe G4100 (AorActSubj):
022:068 And G1161 if G1437 I also G2532 ask G2065 (AorActSubj) [you], ye will G0611 not G3364 answer G0611 (AorPasDepImpr) me G3427, nor G2228 let [me] go G0630 (AorActSubj).
022:069 Hereafter G3568 G0575 shall G2071 (FutInd) the Son G5207 of man G0444 sit G2521 (PresMidPasDepPtc) on G1537 the right hand G1188 of the power G1411 of God G2316.
022:070 Then G1161 said G5346 (ImpfInd) they all G3956, Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 then G3767 the Son G5207 of God G2316? And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Ye G5210 say G3004 (PresActInd) that G3754 I G1473 am G1510 (PresInd).
022:071 And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), What G5101 need G2192 (PresActInd) we G5532 any further G2089 witness G3141? for G1063 we ourselves G0846 have heard G0191 (AorActInd) of G0575 his own G0846 mouth G4750.
023:001 ¶  And G2532 the whole G0537 multitude G4128 of them G0846 arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc), and led G0071 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846 unto G1909 Pilate G4091.
023:002 And G1161 they began G0756 (AorMidDepInd) to accuse G2723 (PresActInf) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), We found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) this G5126 [fellow] perverting G1294 (PresActPtc) the nation G1484, and G2532 forbidding G2967 (PresActPtc) to give G1325 (PresActInf) tribute G5411 to Caesar G2541, saying G3004 (PresActPtc) that he himself G1438 is G1511 (PresInf) Christ G5547 a King G0935.
023:003 And G1161 Pilate G4091 asked G1905 (AorActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Art G1488 (PresInd) thou G4771 the King G0935 of the Jews G2453? And G1161 he answered G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) him G0846 and said G5346 (ImpfInd), Thou G4771 sayest G3004 (PresActInd) [it].
023:004 Then G1161 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) Pilate G4091 to G4314 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 [to] the people G3793, I find G2147 (PresActInd) no G3762 fault G0158 in G1722 this G5129 man G0444.
023:005 And G1161 they were the more fierce G2001 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc) G3754, He stirreth up G0383 (PresActInd) the people G2992, teaching G1321 (PresActPtc) throughout G2596 all G3650 Jewry G2449, beginning G0756 (AorMidPtc) from G0575 Galilee G1056 to G2193 this place G5602.
023:006 When G1161 Pilate G4091 heard G0191 (AorActPtc) of Galilee G1056, he asked G1905 (AorActInd) whether G1487 the man G0444 were G2076 (PresInd) a Galilaean G1057.
023:007 And G2532 as soon as he knew G1921 (Aor2ActPtc) that G3754 he belonged G2076 (PresInd) unto G1537 Herod’s G2264 jurisdiction G1849, he sent G0375 (AorActInd) him G0846 to G4314 Herod G2264, who G5607 himself G0846 also G2532 was G5607 (PresPtc) at G1722 Jerusalem G2414 at G1722 that G5025 time G2250.
023:008 And G1161 when Herod G2264 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) Jesus G2424, he was exceeding G3029 glad G5463 (Aor2PasDepInd): for G1063 he was G2258 (ImpfInd) desirous G2309 (PresActPtc) to see G1492 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846 of G1537 a long G2425 [season], because G1223 he had heard G0191 (PresActInf) many things G4183 of G4012 him G0846; and G2532 he hoped G1679 (ImpfActInd) to have seen G1492 (Aor2ActInf) some G5100 miracle G4592 done G1096 (PresMidPasDepPtc) by G5259 him G0846.
023:009 Then G1161 he questioned G1905 (ImpfActInd) with him G0846 in G1722 many G2425 words G3056; but G1161 he G0846 answered G0611 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846 nothing G3762.
023:010 And G1161 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 scribes G1122 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) and vehemently G2159 accused G2723 (PresActPtc) him G0846.
023:011 And G1161 Herod G2264 with G4862 his G0846 men of war G4753 set G1848 him G0846 at nought G1848 (AorActPtc), and G2532 mocked G1702 (AorActPtc) [him], and arrayed G4016 (Aor2ActPtc) him G0846 in a gorgeous G2986 robe G2066, and sent G0375 him G0846 again G0375 (AorActInd) to Pilate G4091.
023:012 And G1161 G3739 the same G1722 G0846 day G2250 Pilate G4091 and G2532 Herod G2264 were made G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) friends G5384 together G3326 G5037 G0240: for G1063 before G4391 (ImpfActInd) they were G5607 (PresPtc) at G1722 enmity G2189 between G4314 themselves G1438.
023:013 And G1161 Pilate G4091, when he had called together G4779 (AorMidPtc) the chief priests G0749 and G2532 the rulers G0758 and G2532 the people G2992,
023:014 Said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Ye have brought G4374 (AorActInd) this G5129 man G0444 unto me G3427, as G5613 one that perverteth G0654 (PresActPtc) the people G2992: and G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473, having examined G0350 (AorActPtc) [him] before G1799 you G5216, have found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) no G3762 fault G0158 in G1722 this G5126 man G0444 touching those things G3739 whereof G2596 ye accuse G2723 (PresActInd) him G0846:
023:015 No G0235, nor yet G3761 Herod G2264: for G1063 I sent G0375 (AorActInd) you G5209 to G4314 him G0846; and G2532, lo G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), nothing G3762 worthy G0514 of death G2288 is G2076 (PresInd) done G4238 (PerfPasPtc) unto him G0846.
023:016 I will G3811 therefore G3767 chastise G3811 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and release G0630 (FutActInd) [him].
023:017 (For G1161 of necessity G0318 he must G2192 (ImpfActInd) release G0630 (PresActInf) one G1520 unto them G0846 at G2596 the feast G1859.)
023:018 And G1161 they cried out G0349 (AorActInd) all at once G3826, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Away with G0142 (PresActImpr) this G5126 [man], and G1161 release G0630 (AorActImpr) unto us G2254 Barabbas G0912:
023:019 (Who G3748 for G2258 (ImpfInd) G1223 a certain G5100 sedition G4714 made G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) in G1722 the city G4172, and G2532 for murder G5408, was cast G0906 (PerfPasPtc) into G1519 prison G5438.)
023:020 Pilate G4091 therefore G3767, willing G2309 (PresActPtc) to release G0630 (AorActInf) Jesus G2424, spake G4377 again G3825 to them G4377 (AorActInd).
023:021 But G1161 they cried G2019 (ImpfActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Crucify G4717 (AorActImpr) [him], crucify G4717 (AorActImpr) him G0846.
023:022 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846 the third time G5154, Why G1063, what G5101 evil G2556 hath G4160 he G3778 done G4160 (AorActInd)? I have found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) no G3762 cause G0158 of death G2288 in G1722 him G0846: I will G3811 therefore G3767 chastise G3811 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and let [him] go G0630 (FutActInd).
023:023 And G1161 they were instant G1945 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) with loud G3173 voices G5456, requiring G0154 (PresMidPtc) that he G0846 might be crucified G4717 (AorPasInf). And G2532 the voices G5456 of them G0846 and G2532 of the chief priests G0749 prevailed G2729 (ImpfActInd).
023:024 And G1161 Pilate G4091 gave sentence G1948 (AorActInd) that it should be as G1096 (Aor2MidDepInf) they G0846 required G0155.
023:025 And G1161 he released G0630 (AorActInd) unto them G0846 him that for G1223 sedition G4714 and G2532 murder G5408 was cast G0906 (PerfPasPtc) into G1519 prison G5438, whom G3739 they had desired G0154 (ImpfMidInd); but G1161 he delivered G3860 (AorActInd) Jesus G2424 to their G0846 will G2307.
023:026 And G2532 as G5613 they led G0520 him G0846 away G0520 (Aor2ActInd), they laid hold upon G1949 (Aor2MidDepPtc) one G5100 Simon G4613, a Cyrenian G2956, coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepPtc) out of G0575 the country G0068, and on G2007 him G0846 they laid G2007 (AorActInd) the cross G4716, that he might bear G5342 (PresActInf) [it] after G3693 Jesus G2424.
023:027 And G1161 there followed G0190 (ImpfActInd) him G0846 a great G4183 company G4128 of people G2992, and G2532 of women G1135, which G3739 also G2532 bewailed G2875 (ImpfMidInd) and G2532 lamented G2354 (ImpfActInd) him G0846.
023:028 But G1161 Jesus G2424 turning G4762 (Aor2PasPtc) unto G4314 them G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Daughters G2364 of Jerusalem G2419, weep G2799 (PresActImpr) not G3361 for G1909 me G1691, but G4133 weep G2799 (PresActImpr) for G1909 yourselves G1438, and G2532 for G1909 your G5216 children G5043.
023:029 For G3754, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), the days G2250 are coming G2064 (PresMidPasDepInd), in G1722 the which G3739 they shall say G2046 (FutActInd), Blessed G3107 [are] the barren G4723, and G2532 the wombs G2836 that G3739 never G3756 bare G1080 (AorActInd), and G2532 the paps G3149 which G3739 never G3756 gave suck G2337 (AorActInd).
023:030 Then G5119 shall they begin G0756 (FutMidInd) to say G3004 (PresActInf) to the mountains G3735, Fall G4098 (Aor2ActImpr) on G1909 us G2248; and G2532 to the hills G1015, Cover G2572 (AorActImpr) us G2248.
023:031 For G3754 if G1487 they do G4160 (PresActInd) these things G5023 in G1722 a green G5200 tree G3586, what G5101 shall be done G1096 (Aor2MidDepSubj) in G1722 the dry G3584?
023:032 And G1161 there were also G2532 two G1417 other G2087, malefactors G2557, led G0071 (ImpfPasInd) with G4862 him G0846 to be put to death G0337 (AorPasInf).
023:033 And G2532 when G3753 they were come G0565 (Aor2ActInd) to G1909 the place G5117, which G3588 is called G2564 (PresPasPtc) Calvary G2898, there G1563 they crucified G4717 (AorActInd) him G0846, and G2532 the malefactors G2557, one G3739 G3303 on G1537 the right hand G1188, and G1161 the other G3739 on G1537 the left G0710.
023:034 Then G1161 said G3004 (ImpfActInd) Jesus G2424, Father G3962, forgive G0863 (Aor2ActImpr) them G0846; for G1063 they know G1492 (PerfActInd) not G3756 what G5101 they do G4160 (PresActInd). And G1161 they parted G1266 (PresMidPtc) his G0846 raiment G2440, and cast G0906 (Aor2ActInd) lots G2819.
023:035 And G2532 the people G2992 stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) beholding G2334 (PresActPtc). And G1161 the rulers G0758 also G2532 with G4862 them G0846 derided G1592 (ImpfActInd) [him], saying G3004 (PresActPtc), He saved G4982 (AorActInd) others G0243; let him save G4982 (AorActImpr) himself G1438, if G1487 he G3778 be G2076 (PresInd) Christ G5547, the chosen G1588 of God G2316.
023:036 And G1161 the soldiers G4757 also G2532 mocked G1702 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, coming G4334 (PresMidPasDepPtc) to him, and G2532 offering G4374 (PresActPtc) him G0846 vinegar G3690,
023:037 And G2532 saying G3004 (PresActPtc), If G1487 thou G4771 be G1488 (PresInd) the king G0935 of the Jews G2453, save G4982 (AorActImpr) thyself G4572.
023:038 And G1161 a superscription G1923 also G2532 was G2258 (ImpfInd) written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) over G1909 him G0846 in letters G1121 of Greek G1673, and G2532 Latin G4513, and G2532 Hebrew G1444, THIS G3778 IS G2076 (PresInd) THE KING G0935 OF THE JEWS G2453.
023:039 And G1161 one G1520 of the malefactors G2557 which were hanged G2910 (AorPasPtc) railed G0987 (ImpfActInd) on him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), If G1487 thou G4771 be G1488 (PresInd) Christ G5547, save G4982 (AorActImpr) thyself G4572 and G2532 us G2248.
023:040 But G1161 the other G2087 answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) rebuked G2008 (ImpfActInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Dost G5399 not G3761 thou G4771 fear G5399 (PresMidPasDepInd) God G2316, seeing G3754 thou art G1488 (PresInd) in G1722 the same G0846 condemnation G2917?
023:041 And G2532 we G2249 indeed G3303 justly G1346; for G1063 we receive G0618 (PresActInd) the due reward G0514 of our G3739 deeds G4238 (AorActInd): but G1161 this man G3778 hath done G4238 (AorActInd) nothing G3762 amiss G0824.
023:042 And G2532 he said G3004 (ImpfActInd) unto Jesus G2424, Lord G2962, remember G3415 (AorPasImpr) me G3450 when G3752 thou comest G2064 (Aor2ActSubj) into G1722 thy G4675 kingdom G0932.
023:043 And G2532 Jesus G2424 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Verily G0281 I say G3004 (PresActInd) unto thee G4671, To day G4594 shalt thou be G2071 (FutInd) with G3326 me G1700 in G1722 paradise G3857.
023:044 And G1161 it was G2258 (ImpfInd) about G5616 the sixth G1623 hour G5610, and G2532 there was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a darkness G4655 over G1909 all G3650 the earth G1093 until G2193 the ninth G1766 hour G5610.
023:045 And G2532 the sun G2246 was darkened G4654 (AorPasInd), and G2532 the veil G2665 of the temple G3485 was rent G4977 (AorPasInd) in the midst G3319.
023:046 And G2532 when Jesus G2424 had cried G5455 (AorActPtc) with a loud G3173 voice G5456, he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd), Father G3962, into G1519 thy G4675 hands G5495 I commend G3908 (FutMidDepInd) my G3450 spirit G4151: and G2532 having said G2036 (Aor2ActPtc) thus G5023, he gave up the ghost G1606 (AorActInd).
023:047 Now G1161 when the centurion G1543 saw G1492 (Aor2ActPtc) what was done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), he glorified G1392 (AorActInd) God G2316, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Certainly G3689 this G3778 was G2258 (ImpfInd) a righteous G1342 man G0444.
023:048 And G2532 all G3956 the people G3793 that came together G4836 (Aor2MidDepPtc) to G1909 that G5026 sight G2335, beholding G2334 (PresActPtc) the things which were done G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), smote G5180 (PresActPtc) their G1438 breasts G4738, and returned G5290 (ImpfActInd).
023:049 And G1161 all G3956 his G0846 acquaintance G1110, and G2532 the women G1135 that followed G4870 (AorActPtc) him G0846 from G0575 Galilee G1056, stood G2476 (PlupfActInd) afar off G3113, beholding G3708 (PresActPtc) these things G5023.
023:050 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), [there was] a man G0435 named G3686 Joseph G2501, a counsellor G1010; [and he was] a good G5225 (PresActPtc) G0018 man G0435, and G2532 a just G1342:
023:051 (The same G3778 had G4784 not G3756 consented G4784 (PerfMidPasDepPtc) G2258 (ImpfInd) to the counsel G1012 and G2532 deed G4234 of them G0846;) [he was] of G0575 Arimathaea G0707, a city G4172 of the Jews G2453: G2532 who G3739 also G2532 himself G0846 waited for G4327 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) the kingdom G0932 of God G2316.
023:052 This G3778 [man] went G4334 (Aor2ActPtc) unto Pilate G4091, and begged G0154 (AorMidInd) the body G4983 of Jesus G2424.
023:053 And G2532 he took G2507 it G0846 down G2507 (Aor2ActPtc), and wrapped G1794 (AorActInd) it G0846 in linen G4616, and G2532 laid G5087 (AorActInd) it G0846 in G1722 a sepulchre G3418 that was hewn in stone G2991, wherein G3757 never G3756 man G3764 before G3762 was G2258 (ImpfInd) laid G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc).
023:054 And G2532 that day G2250 was G2258 (ImpfInd) the preparation G3904, and G2532 the sabbath G4521 drew on G2020 (ImpfActInd).
023:055 And G1161 the women G1135 also G2532, which G3748 came G2258 (ImpfInd) G4905 (PerfActPtc) with him G0846 from G1537 Galilee G1056, followed after G2628 (AorActPtc), and beheld G2300 (AorMidDepInd) the sepulchre G3419, and G2532 how G5613 his G0846 body G4983 was laid G5087 (AorPasInd).
023:056 And they returned G5290 (AorActPtc), and G1161 prepared G2090 (AorActInd) spices G0759 and G2532 ointments G3464; and G2532 rested G2270 (AorActInd) G3303 the sabbath day G4521 according G2596 to the commandment G1785.
024:001 ¶  Now G1161 upon the first G3391 [day] of the week G4521, very early in the morning G3722 G0901, they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1909 the sepulchre G3418, bringing G5342 (PresActPtc) the spices G0759 which G3739 they had prepared G2090 (AorActInd), and G2532 certain G5100 [others] with G4862 them G0846.
024:002 And G1161 they found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) the stone G3037 rolled away G0617 (PerfPasPtc) from G0575 the sepulchre G3419.
024:003 And G2532 they entered in G1525 (Aor2ActPtc), and found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756 the body G4983 of the Lord G2962 Jesus G2424.
024:004 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G1722 they G0846 were much perplexed G1280 (PresPasInf) thereabout G4012 G5127, G2532 behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), two G1417 men G0435 stood by G2186 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 in G1722 shining G0797 (PresActPtc) garments G2067:
024:005 And G1161 as G1096 they G0846 were G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) afraid G1719, and G2532 bowed down G2827 (PresActPtc) [their] faces G4383 to G1519 the earth G1093, they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, Why G5101 seek ye G2212 (PresActInd) the living G2198 (PresActPtc) among G3326 the dead G3498?
024:006 He is G2076 (PresInd) not G3756 here G5602, but G0235 is risen G1453 (AorPasInd): remember G3415 (AorPasImpr) how G5613 he spake G2980 (AorActInd) unto you G5213 when he was G5607 (PresPtc) yet G2089 in G1722 Galilee G1056,
024:007 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 The Son G5207 of man G0444 must G1163 (PresInd) be delivered G3860 (AorPasInf) into G1519 the hands G5495 of sinful G0268 men G0444, and G2532 be crucified G4717 (AorPasInf), and G2532 the third G5154 day G2250 rise again G0450 (Aor2ActInf).
024:008 And G2532 they remembered G3415 (AorPasInd) his G0846 words G4487,
024:009 And G2532 returned G5290 (AorActPtc) from G0575 the sepulchre G3419, and told G0518 (AorActInd) all G3956 these things G5023 unto the eleven G1733, and G2532 to all G3956 the rest G3062.
024:010 G1161 It was G2258 (ImpfInd) Mary G3137 Magdalene G3094, and G2532 Joanna G2489, and G2532 Mary G3137 [the mother] of James G2385, and G2532 other G3062 [women that were] with G4862 them G0846, which G3739 told G3004 (ImpfActInd) these things G5023 unto G4314 the apostles G0652.
024:011 And G2532 their G0846 words G4487 seemed G5316 (Aor2PasDepSubj) to G1799 them G0846 as G5616 idle tales G3026, and G2532 they believed G0569 them G0846 not G0569 (ImpfActInd).
024:012 Then G1161 arose G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) Peter G4074, and ran G5143 (Aor2ActInd) unto G1909 the sepulchre G3419; and G2532 stooping down G3879 (AorActPtc), he beheld G0991 (PresActInd) the linen clothes G3608 laid G2749 (PresMidPasDepPtc) by themselves G3441, and G2532 departed G0565 (Aor2ActInd), wondering G2296 (PresActPtc) in G4314 himself G1438 at that which was come to pass G1096 (Perf2ActPtc).
024:013 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), two G1417 of G1537 them G0846 went G2258 (ImpfInd) G4198 (PresMidPasDepPtc) that G1722 same G0846 day G2250 to G1519 a village G2968 called G3739 G3686 Emmaus G1695, which was G0568 (PresActPtc) from G0575 Jerusalem G2419 [about] threescore G1835 furlongs G4712.
024:014 And G2532 they G0846 talked G3656 (ImpfActInd) together G4314 G0240 of G4012 all G3956 these things G5130 which had happened G4819 (PerfActPtc).
024:015 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), that, while G1722 they G0846 communed G3656 (PresActInf) [together] and G2532 reasoned G4802 (PresActInf), Jesus G2424 himself G2532 G0846 drew near G1448 (AorActPtc), and went with G4848 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) them G0846.
024:016 But G1161 their G0846 eyes G3788 were holden G2902 (ImpfPasInd) that they should G1921 not G3361 know G1921 (Aor2ActInf) him G0846.
024:017 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, What G5101 manner of communications G3056 [are] these G3778 that G3739 ye have G0474 (PresActInd) one to G4314 another G0240, as ye walk G4043 (PresActPtc), and G2532 are G2075 (PresInd) sad G4659?
024:018 And G1161 the one of them G1520, whose G3739 name G3686 was Cleopas G2810, answering G0611 (AorPasDepPtc) said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 him G0846, Art thou G4771 only G3441 a stranger G3939 (PresActInd) in G1722 Jerusalem G2419, and G2532 hast G1097 not G3756 known G1097 (Aor2ActInd) the things which are come to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) there G1722 G0846 in G1722 these G5025 days G2250?
024:019 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, What things G4169? And G1161 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto him G0846, Concerning G4012 Jesus G2424 of Nazareth G3480, which G3739 was G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) a prophet G4396 mighty G1415 in G1722 G0435 deed G2041 and G2532 word G3056 before G1726 God G2316 and G2532 all G3956 the people G2992:
024:020 And how G3704 G5037 the chief priests G0749 and G2532 our G2257 rulers G0758 delivered G3860 (AorActInd) him G0846 to G1519 be condemned G2917 to death G2288, and G2532 have crucified G4717 (AorActInd) him G0846.
024:021 But G1161 we G2249 trusted G1679 (ImpfActInd) that G3754 it had been G2076 (PresInd) he G0846 which should G3195 (PresActPtc) have redeemed G3084 (PresMidInf) Israel G2474: and G0235 beside G1065 G4862 all G3956 this G5125, to day G4594 is G0071 (PresActInd) the G5026 third G5154 day G2250 since G0575 G3739 these things G5023 were done G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd).
024:022 Yea G0235, and certain G5100 women G1135 also G2532 of G1537 our company G2257 made G1839 us G2248 astonished G1839 (Aor2ActInd), which were G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc) early G3721 at G1909 the sepulchre G3419;
024:023 And G2532 when they found G2147 (Aor2ActPtc) not G3361 his G0846 body G4983, they came G2064 (Aor2ActInd), saying G3004 (PresActPtc), that they had G3708 also G2532 seen G3708 (PerfActInf) a vision G3701 of angels G0032, which G3739 said G3004 (PresActInd) that he G0846 was alive G2198 (PresActInf).
024:024 And G2532 certain of them G5100 which were with G4862 us G2254 went G0565 (Aor2ActInd) to G1909 the sepulchre G3419, and G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) [it] even G2532 so G3779 as G2531 the women G1135 had said G2036 (Aor2ActInd): but G1161 him G0846 they saw G1492 (Aor2ActInd) not G3756.
024:025 Then G2532 he G0846 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto G4314 them G0846, O G5599 fools G0453, and G2532 slow G1021 of heart G2588 to believe G4100 (PresActInf) G1909 all G3956 that G3739 the prophets G4396 have spoken G2980 (AorActInd):
024:026 Ought G1163 (ImpfInd) not G3780 Christ G5547 to have suffered G3958 (Aor2ActInf) these things G5023, and G2532 to enter G1525 (Aor2ActInf) into G1519 his G0846 glory G1391?
024:027 And G2532 beginning G0756 (AorMidPtc) at G0575 Moses G3475 and G2532 G0575 all G3956 the prophets G4396, he expounded G1329 (ImpfActInd) unto them G0846 in G1722 all G3956 the scriptures G1124 the things concerning G4012 himself G1438.
024:028 And G2532 they drew nigh G1448 (AorActInd) unto G1519 the village G2968, whither G3757 they went G4198 (ImpfMidPasDepInd): and G2532 he G0846 made as though G4364 (ImpfMidInd) he would have gone G4198 (PresMidPasDepInf) further G4208.
024:029 But G2532 they constrained G3849 (AorMidDepInd) him G0846, saying G3004 (PresActPtc), Abide G3306 (AorActImpr) with G3326 us G2257: for G3754 it is G2076 (PresInd) toward G4314 evening G2073, and G2532 the day G2250 is far spent G2827 (PerfActInd). And G2532 he went in G1525 (Aor2ActInd) to tarry G3306 (AorActInf) with G4862 them G0846.
024:030 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), as G1722 he G0846 sat at meat G2625 (AorPasInf) with G3326 them G0846, he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) bread G0740, and blessed G2127 (AorActInd) [it], and G2532 brake G2806 (AorActPtc), and gave G1929 (ImpfActInd) to them G0846.
024:031 And G1161 their G0846 eyes G3788 were opened G1272 (AorPasInd), and G2532 they knew G1921 (Aor2ActInd) him G0846; and G2532 he G0846 vanished G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd) G0855 out of G0575 their sight G0846.
024:032 And G2532 they said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) one to another G4314 G0240, Did G2258 (ImpfInd) not G3780 our G2257 heart G2588 burn G2545 (PresPasPtc) within G1722 us G2254, while G5613 he talked G2980 (ImpfActInd) with us G2254 by G1722 the way G3598, and G2532 while G5613 he opened G1272 (ImpfActInd) to us G2254 the scriptures G1124?
024:033 And G2532 they rose up G0450 (Aor2ActPtc) the same G0846 hour G5610, and returned G5290 (AorActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419, and G2532 found G2147 (Aor2ActInd) the eleven G1733 gathered together G4867 (PerfPasPtc), and G2532 them that were with G4862 them G0846,
024:034 Saying G3004 (PresActPtc), G3754 The Lord G2962 is risen G1453 (AorPasInd) indeed G3689, and G2532 hath appeared G3700 (AorPasInd) to Simon G4613.
024:035 And G2532 they G0846 told G1834 (ImpfMidPasDepInd) what things [were done] in G1722 the way G3598, and G2532 how G5613 he was known G1097 (AorPasInd) of them G0846 in G1722 breaking G2800 of bread G0740.
024:036 And G1161 as they G0846 thus G5023 spake G2980 (PresActPtc), Jesus G2424 himself G0846 stood G2476 (Aor2ActInd) in G1722 the midst G3319 of them G0846, and G2532 saith G3004 (PresActInd) unto them G0846, Peace G1515 [be] unto you G5213.
024:037 But G1161 they were terrified G4422 (AorPasPtc) and G2532 affrighted G1719 G1096 (Aor2MidDepPtc), and supposed G1380 (ImpfActInd) that they had seen G2334 (PresActInf) a spirit G4151.
024:038 And G2532 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Why G5101 are ye G2075 (PresInd) troubled G5015 (PerfPasPtc)? and G2532 why G1302 do thoughts G1261 arise G0305 (PresActInd) in G1722 your G5216 hearts G2588?
024:039 Behold G1492 (Aor2ActImpr) my G3450 hands G5495 and G2532 my G3450 feet G4228, that G3754 it is G1510 (PresInd) I G1473 myself G0846: handle G5584 (AorActImpr) me G3165, and G2532 see G1492 (Aor2ActImpr); for G3754 a spirit G4151 hath G2192 (PresActInd) not G3756 flesh G4561 and G2532 bones G3747, as G2531 ye see G2334 (PresActInd) me G1691 have G2192 (PresActPtc).
024:040 And G2532 when he had thus G5124 spoken G2036 (Aor2ActPtc), he shewed G1925 (AorActInd) them G0846 [his] hands G5495 and G2532 [his] feet G4228.
024:041 And G1161 while they G0846 yet G2089 believed not G0569 (PresActPtc) for G0575 joy G5479, and G2532 wondered G2296 (PresActPtc), he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Have ye G2192 (PresActInd) here G1759 any G5100 meat G1034?
024:042 And G1161 they gave G1929 (AorActInd) him G0846 a piece G3313 of a broiled G3702 fish G2486, and G2532 of G0575 an honeycomb G3193 G2781.
024:043 And G2532 he took G2983 (Aor2ActPtc) [it], and did eat G5315 (Aor2ActInd) before G1799 them G0846.
024:044 And G1161 he said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, These G3778 [are] the words G3056 which G3739 I spake G2980 (AorActInd) unto G4314 you G5209, while G5607 (PresPtc) I was yet G2089 with G4862 you G5213, that G3754 all things G3956 must G1163 (PresInd) be fulfilled G4137 (AorPasInf), which G3588 were written G1125 (PerfPasPtc) in G1722 the law G3551 of Moses G3475, and G2532 [in] the prophets G4396, and G2532 [in] the psalms G5568, concerning G4012 me G1700.
024:045 Then G5119 opened he G1272 (AorActInd) their G0846 understanding G3563, that they might understand G4920 (PresActInf) the scriptures G1124,
024:046 And G2532 said G2036 (Aor2ActInd) unto them G0846, Thus G3754 G3779 it is written G1125 (PerfPasInd), and G2532 thus G3779 it behoved G1163 (ImpfInd) Christ G5547 to suffer G3958 (Aor2ActInf), and G2532 to rise G0450 (Aor2ActInf) from G1537 the dead G3498 the third G5154 day G2250:
024:047 And G2532 that repentance G3341 and G2532 remission G0859 of sins G0266 should be preached G2784 (AorPasInf) in G1909 his G0846 name G3686 among G1519 all G3956 nations G1484, beginning G0756 (AorMidPtc) at G0575 Jerusalem G2419.
024:048 And G1161 ye G5210 are G2075 (PresInd) witnesses G3144 of these things G5130.
024:049 And G2532, behold G2400 (Aor2ActImpr), I G1473 send G0649 (PresActInd) the promise G1860 of my G3450 Father G3962 upon G1909 you G5209: but G1161 tarry G2523 (AorActImpr) ye G5210 in G1722 the city G4172 of Jerusalem G2419, until G2193 ye G3739 be endued G1746 (AorMidSubj) with power G1411 from G1537 on high G5311.
024:050 And G1161 he led G1806 (Aor2ActInd) them G0846 out G1854 as far as G2193 to G1519 Bethany G0963, and G2532 he lifted up G1869 (AorActPtc) his G0846 hands G5495, and blessed G2127 (AorActInd) them G0846.
024:051 And G2532 it came to pass G1096 (Aor2MidDepInd), while G1722 he G0846 blessed G2127 (PresActInf) them G0846, he was parted G1339 (Aor2ActInd) from G0575 them G0846, and G2532 carried up G0399 (ImpfPasInd) into G1519 heaven G3772.
024:052 And G2532 they G0846 worshipped G4352 (AorActPtc) him G0846, and returned G5290 (AorActInd) to G1519 Jerusalem G2419 with G3326 great G3173 joy G5479:
024:053 And G2532 were G2258 (ImpfInd) continually G1275 in G1722 the temple G2411, praising G0134 (PresActPtc) and G2532 blessing G2127 (PresActPtc) God G2316. Amen G0281.
