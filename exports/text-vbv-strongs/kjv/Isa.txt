001:001 ¶  The vision H2377 of Isaiah H3470 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531, which he saw H2372 (8804) concerning Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389 in the days H3117 of Uzziah H5818, Jotham H3147, Ahaz H0271, [and] Hezekiah H3169, kings H4428 of Judah H3063.
001:002 Hear H8085 (8798), O heavens H8064, and give ear H0238 (8685), O earth H0776: for the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765), I have nourished H1431 (8765) and brought up H7311 (8790) children H1121, and they have rebelled H6586 (8804) against me.
001:003 The ox H7794 knoweth H3045 (8804) his owner H7069 (8802), and the ass H2543 his master’s H1167 crib H0018: [but] Israel H3478 doth not know H3045 (8804), my people H5971 doth not consider H0995 (8712).
001:004 Ah H1945 sinful H2398 (8802) nation H1471, a people H5971 laden H3515 with iniquity H5771, a seed H2233 of evildoers H7489 (8688), children H1121 that are corrupters H7843 (8688): they have forsaken H5800 (8804) H0853 the LORD H3068, they have provoked H5006 H0853 the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478 unto anger H5006 (8765), they are gone away H2114 (8738) backward H0268.
001:005 Why should ye be stricken H5221 (8714) any more? ye will revolt H5627 more and more H3254 (8686): the whole head H7218 is sick H2483, and the whole heart H3824 faint H1742.
001:006 From the sole H3709 of the foot H7272 even unto the head H7218 [there is] no soundness H4974 in it; [but] wounds H6482, and bruises H2250, and putrifying H2961 sores H4347: they have not been closed H2115 (8804), neither bound up H2280 (8795), neither mollified H7401 (8795) with ointment H8081.
001:007 Your country H0776 [is] desolate H8077, your cities H5892 [are] burned H8313 (8803) with fire H0784: your land H0127, strangers H2114 (8801) devour H0398 (8802) it in your presence, and [it is] desolate H8077, as overthrown H4114 by strangers H2114 (8801).
001:008 And the daughter H1323 of Zion H6726 is left H3498 (8738) as a cottage H5521 in a vineyard H3754, as a lodge H4412 in a garden of cucumbers H4750, as a besieged H5341 (8803) city H5892.
001:009 Except H3884 the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 had left H3498 (8689) unto us a very small H4592 remnant H8300, we should have been H1961 (8804) as Sodom H5467, [and] we should have been like H1819 (8804) unto Gomorrah H6017.
001:010 Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, ye rulers H7101 of Sodom H5467; give ear H0238 (8685) unto the law H8451 of our God H0430, ye people H5971 of Gomorrah H6017.
001:011 To what H4100 purpose [is] the multitude H7230 of your sacrifices H2077 unto me? saith H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068: I am full H7646 (8804) of the burnt offerings H5930 of rams H0352, and the fat H2459 of fed beasts H4806; and I delight H2654 (8804) not in the blood H1818 of bullocks H6499, or of lambs H3532, or of he goats H6260.
001:012 When ye come H0935 (8799) to appear H7200 (8736) before H6440 me, who hath required H1245 (8765) this at your hand H3027, to tread H7429 (8800) my courts H2691?
001:013 Bring H0935 (8687) no more H3254 (8686) vain H7723 oblations H4503; incense H7004 is an abomination H8441 unto me; the new moons H2320 and sabbaths H7676, the calling H7121 (8800) of assemblies H4744, I cannot away with H3201 (8799); [it is] iniquity H0205, even the solemn meeting H6116.
001:014 Your new moons H2320 and your appointed feasts H4150 my soul H5315 hateth H8130 (8804): they are a trouble H2960 unto me; I am weary H3811 (8738) to bear H5375 (8800) [them].
001:015 And when ye spread forth H6566 (8763) your hands H3709, I will hide H5956 (8686) mine eyes H5869 from you: yea, when ye make many H7235 (8686) prayers H8605, I will not hear H8085 (8802): your hands H3027 are full H4390 (8804) of blood H1818.
001:016 Wash H7364 (8798) you, make you clean H2135 (8690); put away H5493 (8685) the evil H7455 of your doings H4611 from before H5048 mine eyes H5869; cease H2308 (8798) to do evil H7489 (8687);
001:017 Learn H3925 (8798) to do well H3190 (8687); seek H1875 (8798) judgment H4941, relieve H0833 (8761) the oppressed H2541, judge H8199 (8798) the fatherless H3490, plead H7378 (8798) for the widow H0490.
001:018 Come now H3212 (8798), and let us reason together H3198 (8735), saith H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068: though your sins H2399 be as scarlet H8144, they shall be as white H3835 (8686) as snow H7950; though they be red H0119 (8686) like crimson H8438, they shall be as wool H6785.
001:019 If ye be willing H0014 (8799) and obedient H8085 (8804), ye shall eat H0398 (8799) the good H2898 of the land H0776:
001:020 But if ye refuse H3985 (8762) and rebel H4784 (8804), ye shall be devoured H0398 (8792) with the sword H2719: for the mouth H6310 of the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
001:021 How is the faithful H0539 (8737) city H7151 become an harlot H2181 (8802)! it was full H4392 of judgment H4941; righteousness H6664 lodged H3885 (8799) in it; but now murderers H7523 (8764).
001:022 Thy silver H3701 is become dross H5509, thy wine H5435 mixed H4107 (8803) with water H4325:
001:023 Thy princes H8269 [are] rebellious H5637 (8802), and companions H2270 of thieves H1590: every one loveth H0157 (8802) gifts H7810, and followeth H7291 (8802) after rewards H8021: they judge H8199 (8799) not the fatherless H3490, neither doth the cause H7379 of the widow H0490 come H0935 (8799) unto them.
001:024 Therefore saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0113, the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the mighty One H0046 of Israel H3478, Ah H1945, I will ease H5162 (8735) me of mine adversaries H6862, and avenge H5358 (8735) me of mine enemies H0341 (8802):
001:025 And I will turn H7725 (8686) my hand H3027 upon thee, and purely H1253 purge away H6884 (8799) thy dross H5509, and take away H5493 (8686) all thy tin H0913:
001:026 And I will restore H7725 (8686) thy judges H8199 (8802) as at the first H7223, and thy counsellors H3289 (8802) as at the beginning H8462: afterward H0310 thou shalt be called H7121 (8735), The city H5892 of righteousness H6664, the faithful H0539 (8737) city H7151.
001:027 Zion H6726 shall be redeemed H6299 (8735) with judgment H4941, and her converts H7725 (8802) with righteousness H6666.
001:028 And the destruction H7667 of the transgressors H6586 (8802) and of the sinners H2400 [shall be] together H3162, and they that forsake H5800 (8802) the LORD H3068 shall be consumed H3615 (8799).
001:029 For they shall be ashamed H0954 (8799) of the oaks H0352 which ye have desired H2530 (8804), and ye shall be confounded H2659 (8799) for the gardens H1593 that ye have chosen H0977 (8804).
001:030 For ye shall be as an oak H0424 whose leaf H5929 fadeth H5034 (8802), and as a garden H1593 that hath no water H4325.
001:031 And the strong H2634 shall be as tow H5296, and the maker H6467 of it as a spark H5213, and they shall both H8147 burn H1197 (8804) together H3162, and none shall quench H3518 (8764) [them].
002:001 ¶  The word H1697 that Isaiah H3470 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531 saw H2372 (8804) concerning Judah H3063 and Jerusalem H3389.
002:002 And it shall come to pass in the last H0319 days H3117, [that] the mountain H2022 of the LORD’S H3068 house H1004 shall be established H3559 (8737) in the top H7218 of the mountains H2022, and shall be exalted H5375 (8737) above the hills H1389; and all nations H1471 shall flow H5102 (8804) unto it.
002:003 And many H7227 people H5971 shall go H1980 (8804) and say H0559 (8804), Come H3212 (8798) ye, and let us go up H5927 (8799) to the mountain H2022 of the LORD H3068, to the house H1004 of the God H0430 of Jacob H3290; and he will teach H3384 (8686) us of his ways H1870, and we will walk H3212 (8799) in his paths H0734: for out of Zion H6726 shall go forth H3318 (8799) the law H8451, and the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 from Jerusalem H3389.
002:004 And he shall judge H8199 (8804) among the nations H1471, and shall rebuke H3198 (8689) many H7227 people H5971: and they shall beat H3807 (8765) their swords H2719 into plowshares H0855, and their spears H2595 into pruninghooks H4211: nation H1471 shall not lift up H5375 (8799) sword H2719 against nation H1471, neither shall they learn H3925 (8799) war H4421 any more.
002:005 O house H1004 of Jacob H3290, come H3212 (8798) ye, and let us walk H3212 (8799) in the light H0216 of the LORD H3068.
002:006 Therefore thou hast forsaken H5203 (8804) thy people H5971 the house H1004 of Jacob H3290, because they be replenished H4390 (8804) from the east H6924, and [are] soothsayers H6049 (8781) like the Philistines H6430, and they please H5606 (8686) themselves in the children H3206 of strangers H5237.
002:007 Their land H0776 also is full H4390 (8735) of silver H3701 and gold H2091, neither [is there any] end H7097 of their treasures H0214; their land H0776 is also full H4390 (8735) of horses H5483, neither [is there any] end H7097 of their chariots H4818:
002:008 Their land H0776 also is full H4390 (8735) of idols H0457; they worship H7812 (8691) the work H4639 of their own hands H3027, that which their own fingers H0676 have made H6213 (8804):
002:009 And the mean man H0120 boweth down H7817 (8735), and the great man H0376 humbleth H8213 (8799) himself: therefore forgive H5375 (8799) them not.
002:010 Enter H0935 (8798) into the rock H6697, and hide H2934 (8734) thee in the dust H6083, for H6440 fear H6343 of the LORD H3068, and for the glory H1926 of his majesty H1347.
002:011 The lofty H1365 looks H5869 of man H0120 shall be humbled H8213 (8804), and the haughtiness H7312 of men H0582 shall be bowed down H7817 (8804), and the LORD H3068 alone shall be exalted H7682 (8738) in that day H3117.
002:012 For the day H3117 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [shall be] upon every [one that is] proud H1343 and lofty H7311 (8802), and upon every [one that is] lifted up H5375 (8737); and he shall be brought low H8213 (8804):
002:013 And upon all the cedars H0730 of Lebanon H3844, [that are] high H7311 (8802) and lifted up H5375 (8737), and upon all the oaks H0437 of Bashan H1316,
002:014 And upon all the high H7311 (8802) mountains H2022, and upon all the hills H1389 [that are] lifted up H5375 (8737),
002:015 And upon every high H1364 tower H4026, and upon every fenced H1219 (8803) wall H2346,
002:016 And upon all the ships H0591 of Tarshish H8659, and upon all pleasant H2532 pictures H7914.
002:017 And the loftiness H1365 of man H0120 shall be bowed down H7817 (8804), and the haughtiness H7312 of men H0582 shall be made low H8213 (8804): and the LORD H3068 alone shall be exalted H7682 (8738) in that day H3117.
002:018 And the idols H0457 he shall utterly H3632 abolish H2498 (8799).
002:019 And they shall go H0935 (8804) into the holes H4631 of the rocks H6697, and into the caves H4247 of the earth H6083, for H6440 fear H6343 of the LORD H3068, and for the glory H1926 of his majesty H1347, when he ariseth H6965 (8800) to shake terribly H6206 (8800) the earth H0776.
002:020 In that day H3117 a man H0120 shall cast H7993 (8686) his idols H0457 of silver H3701, and his idols H0457 of gold H2091, which they made [each one] for himself H6213 (8804) to worship H7812 (8692), to the moles H2661 H6512 and to the bats H5847;
002:021 To go H0935 (8800) into the clefts H5366 of the rocks H6697, and into the tops H5585 of the ragged rocks H5553, for H6440 fear H6343 of the LORD H3068, and for the glory H1926 of his majesty H1347, when he ariseth H6965 (8800) to shake terribly H6206 (8800) the earth H0776.
002:022 Cease H2308 (8798) ye from man H0120, whose breath H5397 [is] in his nostrils H0639: for wherein is he to be accounted of H2803 (8737)?
003:001 ¶  For, behold, the Lord H0113, the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, doth take away H5493 (8688) from Jerusalem H3389 and from Judah H3063 the stay H4937 and the staff H4938, the whole stay H4937 of bread H3899, and the whole H3605 stay H4937 of water H4325,
003:002 The mighty man H1368, and the man H0376 of war H4421, the judge H8199 (8802), and the prophet H5030, and the prudent H7080 (8802), and the ancient H2205,
003:003 The captain H8269 of fifty H2572, and the honourable H5375 (8803) man H6440, and the counsellor H3289 (8802), and the cunning H2450 artificer H2791, and the eloquent H0995 (8737) orator H3908.
003:004 And I will give H5414 (8804) children H5288 [to be] their princes H8269, and babes H8586 shall rule H4910 (8799) over them.
003:005 And the people H5971 shall be oppressed H5065 (8738), every one H0376 by another H0376, and every one H0376 by his neighbour H7453: the child H5288 shall behave himself proudly H7292 (8799) against the ancient H2205, and the base H7034 (8737) against the honourable H3513 (8737).
003:006 When a man H0376 shall take hold H8610 (8799) of his brother H0251 of the house H1004 of his father H0001, [saying], Thou hast clothing H8071, be thou our ruler H7101, and [let] this ruin H4384 [be] under thy hand H3027:
003:007 In that day H3117 shall he swear H5375 (8799), saying H0559 (8800), I will not be an healer H2280 (8802); for in my house H1004 [is] neither bread H3899 nor clothing H8071: make H7760 (8799) me not a ruler H7101 of the people H5971.
003:008 For Jerusalem H3389 is ruined H3782 (8804), and Judah H3063 is fallen H5307 (8804): because their tongue H3956 and their doings H4611 [are] against the LORD H3068, to provoke H4784 (8687) the eyes H5869 of his glory H3519.
003:009 The shew H1971 of their countenance H6440 doth witness against them H6030 (8804); and they declare H5046 (8689) their sin H2403 as Sodom H5467, they hide H3582 (8765) [it] not. Woe H0188 unto their soul H5315! for they have rewarded H1580 (8804) evil H7451 unto themselves.
003:010 Say H0559 (8798) ye to the righteous H6662, that [it shall be] well H2896 [with him]: for they shall eat H0398 (8799) the fruit H6529 of their doings H4611.
003:011 Woe H0188 unto the wicked H7563! [it shall be] ill H7451 [with him]: for the reward H1576 of his hands H3027 shall be given H6213 (8735) him.
003:012 [As for] my people H5971, children H5953 (8781) [are] their oppressors H5065 (8802), and women H0802 rule H4910 (8804) over them. O my people H5971, they which lead H0833 (8764) thee cause [thee] to err H8582 (8688), and destroy H1104 (8765) the way H1870 of thy paths H0734.
003:013 The LORD H3068 standeth up H5324 (8737) to plead H7378 (8800), and standeth H5975 (8802) to judge H1777 (8800) the people H5971.
003:014 The LORD H3068 will enter H0935 (8799) into judgment H4941 with the ancients H2205 of his people H5971, and the princes H8269 thereof: for ye have eaten up H1197 (8765) the vineyard H3754; the spoil H1500 of the poor H6041 [is] in your houses H1004.
003:015 What mean ye [that] ye beat H1792 my people H5971 to pieces H1792 (8762), and grind H2912 (8799) the faces H6440 of the poor H6041? saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635.
003:016 Moreover the LORD H3068 saith H0559 (8799), Because H3282 the daughters H1323 of Zion H6726 are haughty H1361 (8804), and walk H3212 (8799) with stretched forth H5186 (8803) necks H1627 and wanton H8265 (8764) eyes H5869, walking H1980 (8800) and mincing H2952 (8800) [as] they go H3212 (8799), and making a tinkling H5913 (8762) with their feet H7272:
003:017 Therefore the Lord H0136 will smite with a scab H5596 (8765) the crown of the head H6936 of the daughters H1323 of Zion H6726, and the LORD H3068 will discover H6168 (8762) their secret parts H6596.
003:018 In that day H3117 the Lord H0136 will take away H5493 (8686) the bravery H8597 of [their] tinkling ornaments H5914 [about their feet], and [their] cauls H7636, and [their] round tires like the moon H7720,
003:019 The chains H5188, and the bracelets H8285, and the mufflers H7479,
003:020 The bonnets H6287, and the ornaments of the legs H6807, and the headbands H7196, and the tablets H5315 H1004, and the earrings H3908,
003:021 The rings H2885, and nose H0639 jewels H5141,
003:022 The changeable suits of apparel H4254, and the mantles H4595, and the wimples H4304, and the crisping pins H2754,
003:023 The glasses H1549, and the fine linen H5466, and the hoods H6797, and the vails H7289.
003:024 And it shall come to pass, [that] instead of sweet smell H1314 there shall be stink H4716; and instead of a girdle H2290 a rent H5364; and instead of well set H4639 hair H4748 baldness H7144; and instead of a stomacher H6614 a girding H4228 of sackcloth H8242; [and] burning H3587 instead of beauty H3308.
003:025 Thy men H4962 shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719, and thy mighty H1369 in the war H4421.
003:026 And her gates H6607 shall lament H0578 (8804) and mourn H0056 (8804); and she [being] desolate H5352 (8738) shall sit H3427 (8799) upon the ground H0776.
004:001 ¶  And in that day H3117 seven H7651 women H0802 shall take hold H2388 (8689) of one H0259 man H0376, saying H0559 (8800), We will eat H0398 (8799) our own bread H3899, and wear H3847 (8799) our own apparel H8071: only let us be called H7121 (8735) by thy name H8034, to take away H0622 (8798) our reproach H2781.
004:002 In that day H3117 shall the branch H6780 of the LORD H3068 be beautiful H6643 and glorious H3519, and the fruit H6529 of the earth H0776 [shall be] excellent H1347 and comely for H8597 them that are escaped H6413 of Israel H3478.
004:003 And it shall come to pass, [that he that is] left H7604 (8737) in Zion H6726, and [he that] remaineth H3498 (8737) in Jerusalem H3389, shall be called H0559 (8735) holy H6918, [even] every one that is written H3789 (8803) among the living H2416 in Jerusalem H3389:
004:004 When the Lord H0136 shall have washed away H7364 (8804) the filth H6675 of the daughters H1323 of Zion H6726, and shall have purged H1740 (8686) the blood H1818 of Jerusalem H3389 from the midst H7130 thereof by the spirit H7307 of judgment H4941, and by the spirit H7307 of burning H1197 (8763).
004:005 And the LORD H3068 will create H1254 (8804) upon every dwelling place H4349 of mount H2022 Zion H6726, and upon her assemblies H4744, a cloud H6051 and smoke H6227 by day H3119, and the shining H5051 of a flaming H3852 fire H0784 by night H3915: for upon all the glory H3519 [shall be] a defence H2646.
004:006 And there shall be a tabernacle H5521 for a shadow H6738 in the daytime H3119 from the heat H2721, and for a place of refuge H4268, and for a covert H4563 from storm H2230 and from rain H4306.
005:001 ¶  Now will I sing H7891 (8799) to my wellbeloved H3039 a song H7892 of my beloved H1730 touching his vineyard H3754. My wellbeloved H3039 hath a vineyard H3754 in a very fruitful H1121 H8081 hill H7161:
005:002 And he fenced H5823 (8762) it, and gathered out the stones H5619 (8762) thereof, and planted H5193 (8799) it with the choicest vine H8321, and built H1129 (8799) a tower H4026 in the midst H8432 of it, and also made H2672 (8804) a winepress H3342 therein: and he looked H6960 (8762) that it should bring forth H6213 (8800) grapes H6025, and it brought forth H6213 (8799) wild grapes H0891.
005:003 And now, O inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, and men H0376 of Judah H3063, judge H8199 (8798), I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard H3754.
005:004 What could have been done H6213 (8800) more to my vineyard H3754, that I have not done H6213 (8804) in it? wherefore H4069, when I looked H6960 (8765) that it should bring forth H6213 (8800) grapes H6025, brought it forth H6213 (8799) wild grapes H0891?
005:005 And now go to; I will tell H3045 (8686) you what I will do H6213 (8802) to my vineyard H3754: I will take away H5493 (8687) the hedge H4881 thereof, and it shall be eaten up H1197 (8763); [and] break down H6555 (8800) the wall H1447 thereof, and it shall be trodden down H4823:
005:006 And I will lay H7896 (8799) it waste H1326: it shall not be pruned H2168 (8735), nor digged H5737 (8735); but there shall come up H5927 (8804) briers H8068 and thorns H7898: I will also command H6680 (8762) the clouds H5645 that they rain H4305 (8687) no rain H4306 upon it.
005:007 For the vineyard H3754 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] the house H1004 of Israel H3478, and the men H0376 of Judah H3063 his pleasant H8191 plant H5194: and he looked H6960 (8762) for judgment H4941, but behold oppression H4939; for righteousness H6666, but behold a cry H6818.
005:008 Woe H1945 unto them that join H5060 (8688) house H1004 to house H1004, [that] lay H7126 (8686) field H7704 to field H7704, till [there be] no H0657 place H4725, that they may be placed H3427 (8717) alone in the midst H7130 of the earth H0776!
005:009 In mine ears H0241 [said] the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, Of a truth H3808 many H7227 houses H1004 shall be desolate H8047, [even] great H1419 and fair H2896, without inhabitant H3427 (8802).
005:010 Yea H3588, ten H6235 acres H6776 of vineyard H3754 shall yield H6213 (8799) one H0259 bath H1324, and the seed H2233 of an homer H2563 shall yield H6213 (8799) an ephah H0374.
005:011 Woe H1945 unto them that rise up early H7925 (8688) in the morning H1242, [that] they may follow H7291 (8799) strong drink H7941; that continue H0309 (8764) until night H5399, [till] wine H3196 inflame H1814 (8686) them!
005:012 And the harp H3658, and the viol H5035, the tabret H8596, and pipe H2485, and wine H3196, are in their feasts H4960: but they regard H5027 (8686) not the work H6467 of the LORD H3068, neither consider H7200 (8804) the operation H4639 of his hands H3027.
005:013 Therefore my people H5971 are gone into captivity H1540 (8804), because [they have] no knowledge H1847: and their honourable H3519 men H4962 [are] famished H7458, and their multitude H1995 dried up H6704 with thirst H6772.
005:014 Therefore hell H7585 hath enlarged H7337 (8689) herself H5315, and opened H6473 (8804) her mouth H6310 without measure H2706: and their glory H1926, and their multitude H1995, and their pomp H7588, and he that rejoiceth H5938, shall descend H3381 (8804) into it.
005:015 And the mean man H0120 shall be brought down H7817 (8735), and the mighty man H0376 shall be humbled H8213 (8799), and the eyes H5869 of the lofty H1364 shall be humbled H8213 (8799):
005:016 But the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 shall be exalted H1361 (8799) in judgment H4941, and God H0410 that is holy H6918 shall be sanctified H6942 (8738) in righteousness H6666.
005:017 Then shall the lambs H3532 feed H7462 (8804) after their manner H1699, and the waste places H2723 of the fat ones H4220 shall strangers H1481 (8802) eat H0398 (8799).
005:018 Woe H1945 unto them that draw H4900 (8802) iniquity H5771 with cords H2256 of vanity H7723, and sin H2403 as it were with a cart H5699 rope H5688:
005:019 That say H0559 (8802), Let him make speed H4116 (8762), [and] hasten H2363 (8686) his work H4639, that we may see H7200 (8799) [it]: and let the counsel H6098 of the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478 draw nigh H7126 (8799) and come H0935 (8799), that we may know H3045 (8799) [it]!
005:020 Woe H1945 unto them that call H0559 (8802) evil H7451 good H2896, and good H2896 evil H7451; that put H7760 (8802) darkness H2822 for light H0216, and light H0216 for darkness H2822; that put H7760 (8802) bitter H4751 for sweet H4966, and sweet H4966 for bitter H4751!
005:021 Woe H1945 unto [them that are] wise H2450 in their own eyes H5869, and prudent H0995 (8737) in their own sight H6440!
005:022 Woe H1945 unto [them that are] mighty H1368 to drink H8354 (8800) wine H3196, and men H0582 of strength H2428 to mingle H4537 (8800) strong drink H7941:
005:023 Which justify H6663 (8688) the wicked H7563 for H6118 reward H7810, and take away H5493 (8686) the righteousness H6666 of the righteous H6662 from him!
005:024 Therefore as the fire H0784 devoureth H0398 (8800) the stubble H7179, and the flame H3956 H3852 consumeth H7503 (8799) the chaff H2842, [so] their root H8328 shall be as rottenness H4716, and their blossom H6525 shall go up H5927 (8799) as dust H0080: because they have cast away H3988 (8804) the law H8451 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, and despised H5006 (8765) the word H0565 of the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
005:025 Therefore is the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 kindled H2734 (8804) against his people H5971, and he hath stretched forth H5186 (8799) his hand H3027 against them, and hath smitten H5221 (8686) them: and the hills H2022 did tremble H7264 (8799), and their carcases H5038 [were] torn H5478 in the midst H7130 of the streets H2351. For all this his anger H0639 is not turned away H7725 (8804), but his hand H3027 [is] stretched out H5186 (8803) still.
005:026 And he will lift up H5375 (8804) an ensign H5251 to the nations H1471 from far H7350, and will hiss H8319 (8804) unto them from the end H7097 of the earth H0776: and, behold, they shall come H0935 (8799) with speed H4120 swiftly H7031:
005:027 None shall be weary H5889 nor stumble H3782 (8802) among them; none shall slumber H5123 (8799) nor sleep H3462 (8799); neither shall the girdle H0232 of their loins H2504 be loosed H6605 (8738), nor the latchet H8288 of their shoes H5275 be broken H5423 (8738):
005:028 Whose arrows H2671 [are] sharp H8150 (8802), and all their bows H7198 bent H1869 (8803), their horses H5483 ’ hoofs H6541 shall be counted H2803 (8738) like flint H6862, and their wheels H1534 like a whirlwind H5492:
005:029 Their roaring H7581 [shall be] like a lion H3833, they shall roar H7580 (8799) (8675) H7580 (8804) like young lions H3715: yea, they shall roar H5098 (8799), and lay hold H0270 (8799) of the prey H2964, and shall carry [it] away safe H6403 (8686), and none shall deliver H5337 (8688) [it].
005:030 And in that day H3117 they shall roar H5098 (8799) against them like the roaring H5100 of the sea H3220: and if [one] look H5027 (8765) unto the land H0776, behold darkness H2822 [and] sorrow H6862, and the light H0216 is darkened H2821 (8804) in the heavens H6183 thereof.
006:001 ¶  In the year H8141 that king H4428 Uzziah H5818 died H4194 I saw H7200 (8799) also H0853 the Lord H0136 sitting H3427 (8802) upon a throne H3678, high H7311 (8802) and lifted up H5375 (8737), and his train H7757 filled H4392 H0853 the temple H1964.
006:002 Above H4605 it stood H5975 (8802) the seraphims H8314: each one H0259 had six H8337 wings H3671; with twain H8147 he covered H3680 (8762) his face H6440, and with twain H8147 he covered H3680 (8762) his feet H7272, and with twain H8147 he did fly H5774 (8787).
006:003 And one cried H7121 (8804) unto another, and said H0559 (8804), Holy H6918, holy H6918, holy H6918, [is] the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635: the whole earth H0776 [is] full H4393 of his glory H3519.
006:004 And the posts H0520 of the door H5592 moved H5128 (8799) at the voice H6963 of him that cried H7121 (8802), and the house H1004 was filled H4390 (8735) with smoke H6227.
006:005 Then said H0559 (8799) I, Woe H0188 [is] me! for I am undone H1820 (8738); because I [am] a man H0376 of unclean H2931 lips H8193, and I dwell H3427 (8802) in the midst H8432 of a people H5971 of unclean H2931 lips H8193: for mine eyes H5869 have seen H7200 (8804) the King H4428, the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
006:006 Then flew H5774 (8799) one H0259 of the seraphims H8314 unto me, having a live coal H7531 in his hand H3027, [which] he had taken H3947 (8804) with the tongs H4457 from off the altar H4196:
006:007 And he laid H5060 (8686) [it] upon my mouth H6310, and said H0559 (8799), Lo, this hath touched H5060 (8804) thy lips H8193; and thine iniquity H5771 is taken away H5493 (8804), and thy sin H2403 purged H3722 (8792).
006:008 Also I heard H8085 (8799) the voice H6963 of the Lord H0136, saying H0559 (8802), Whom shall I send H7971 (8799), and who will go H3212 (8799) for us? Then said H0559 (8799) I, Here [am] I; send H7971 (8798) me.
006:009 And he said H0559 (8799), Go H3212 (8798), and tell H0559 (8804) this people H5971, Hear H8085 (8798) ye indeed H8085 (8800), but understand H0995 (8799) not; and see H7200 (8798) ye indeed H7200 (8800), but perceive H3045 (8799) not.
006:010 Make the heart H3820 of this people H5971 fat H8080 (8685), and make their ears H0241 heavy H3513 (8685), and shut H8173 (8685) their eyes H5869; lest they see H7200 (8799) with their eyes H5869, and hear H8085 (8799) with their ears H0241, and understand H0995 (8799) with their heart H3824, and convert H7725 (8802), and be healed H7495 (8804).
006:011 Then said H0559 (8799) I, Lord H0136, how long? And he answered H0559 (8799), Until the cities H5892 be wasted H7582 (8804) without inhabitant H3427 (8802), and the houses H1004 without man H0120, and the land H0127 be utterly H8077 desolate H7582 (8735),
006:012 And the LORD H3068 have removed H7368 men H0120 far away H7368 (8765), and [there be] a great H7227 forsaking H5805 in the midst H7130 of the land H0776.
006:013 But yet in it [shall be] a tenth H6224, and [it] shall return H7725 (8804), and shall be eaten H1197 (8763): as a teil tree H0424, and as an oak H0437, whose substance H4678 [is] in them, when they cast H7995 [their leaves: so] the holy H6944 seed H2233 [shall be] the substance H4678 thereof.
007:001 ¶  And it came to pass in the days H3117 of Ahaz H0271 the son H1121 of Jotham H3147, the son H1121 of Uzziah H5818, king H4428 of Judah H3063, [that] Rezin H7526 the king H4428 of Syria H0758, and Pekah H6492 the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425, king H4428 of Israel H3478, went up H5927 (8804) toward Jerusalem H3389 to war H4421 against it, but could H3201 (8804) not prevail H3898 (8736) against it.
007:002 And it was told H5046 (8714) the house H1004 of David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Syria H0758 is confederate H5117 (8804) with Ephraim H0669. And his heart H3824 was moved H5128 (8799), and the heart H3824 of his people H5971, as the trees H6086 of the wood H3293 are moved H5128 (8800) with H6440 the wind H7307.
007:003 Then said H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068 unto Isaiah H3470, Go forth H3318 (8798) now to meet H7125 (8800) Ahaz H0271, thou, and Shearjashub H7610 thy son H1121, at the end H7097 of the conduit H8585 of the upper H5945 pool H1295 in the highway H4546 of the fuller’s H3526 (8801) field H7704;
007:004 And say H0559 (8804) unto him, Take heed H8104 (8734), and be quiet H8252 (8685); fear H3372 (8799) not, neither be fainthearted H7401 (8735) H3824 for the two H8147 tails H2180 of these smoking H6226 firebrands H0181, for the fierce H2750 anger H0639 of Rezin H7526 with Syria H0758, and of the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425.
007:005 Because Syria H0758, Ephraim H0669, and the son H1121 of Remaliah H7425, have taken evil H7451 counsel H3289 (8804) against thee, saying H0559 (8800),
007:006 Let us go up H5927 (8799) against Judah H3063, and vex H6973 (8686) it, and let us make a breach H1234 (8686) therein for us, and set H4427 (8686) a king H4428 in the midst H8432 of it, [even] the son H1121 of Tabeal H2870:
007:007 Thus H3541 saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, It shall not stand H6965 (8799), neither shall it come to pass.
007:008 For the head H7218 of Syria H0758 [is] Damascus H1834, and the head H7218 of Damascus H1834 [is] Rezin H7526; and within threescore H8346 and five H2568 years H8141 shall Ephraim H0669 be broken H2865 (8735), that it be not a people H5971.
007:009 And the head H7218 of Ephraim H0669 [is] Samaria H8111, and the head H7218 of Samaria H8111 [is] Remaliah’s H7425 son H1121. If ye will not believe H0539 (8686), surely ye shall not be established H0539 (8735).
007:010 Moreover the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8763) again H3254 (8686) unto Ahaz H0271, saying H0559 (8800),
007:011 Ask H7592 (8798) thee a sign H0226 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430; ask H7592 (8800) it either in the depth H6009 (8685), or in the height H1361 (8687) above H4605.
007:012 But Ahaz H0271 said H0559 (8799), I will not ask H7592 (8799), neither will I tempt H5254 (8762) H0853 the LORD H3068.
007:013 And he said H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798) ye now, O house H1004 of David H1732; [Is it] a small thing H4592 for you to weary H3811 (8687) men H0582, but will ye weary H3811 (8686) my God H0430 also?
007:014 Therefore the Lord H0136 himself shall give H5414 (8799) you a sign H0226; Behold, a virgin H5959 shall conceive H2030, and bear H3205 (8802) a son H1121, and shall call H7121 (8804) his name H8034 Immanuel H6005 H0410.
007:015 Butter H2529 and honey H1706 shall he eat H0398 (8799), that he may know H3045 (8800) to refuse H3988 (8800) the evil H7451, and choose H0977 (8800) the good H2896.
007:016 For before the child H5288 shall know H3045 (8799) to refuse H3988 (8800) the evil H7451, and choose H0977 (8800) the good H2896, the land H0127 that thou abhorrest H6973 (8801) shall be H6440 forsaken H5800 (8735) of both H8147 her kings H4428.
007:017 The LORD H3068 shall bring H0935 (8686) upon thee, and upon thy people H5971, and upon thy father’s H0001 house H1004, days H3117 that have not come H0935 (8804), from the day H3117 that Ephraim H0669 departed H5493 (8800) from Judah H3063; [even] the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
007:018 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] the LORD H3068 shall hiss H8319 (8799) for the fly H2070 that [is] in the uttermost part H7097 of the rivers H2975 of Egypt H4714, and for the bee H1682 that [is] in the land H0776 of Assyria H0804.
007:019 And they shall come H0935 (8804), and shall rest H5117 (8804) all of them in the desolate H1327 valleys H5158, and in the holes H5357 of the rocks H5553, and upon all thorns H5285, and upon all bushes H5097.
007:020 In the same day H3117 shall the Lord H0136 shave H1548 (8762) with a razor H8593 that is hired H7917, [namely], by them beyond H5676 the river H5104, by the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, the head H7218, and the hair H8181 of the feet H7272: and it shall also consume H5595 (8799) the beard H2206.
007:021 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] a man H0376 shall nourish H2421 (8762) a young H1241 cow H5697, and two H8147 sheep H6629;
007:022 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance H7230 of milk H2461 [that] they shall give H6213 (8800) he shall eat H0398 (8799) butter H2529: for butter H2529 and honey H1706 shall every one eat H0398 (8799) that is left H3498 (8737) in H7130 the land H0776.
007:023 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] every place H4725 shall be, where there were a thousand H0505 vines H1612 at a thousand H0505 silverlings H3701, it shall [even] be for briers H8068 and thorns H7898.
007:024 With arrows H2671 and with bows H7198 shall [men] come H0935 (8799) thither; because all the land H0776 shall become briers H8068 and thorns H7898.
007:025 And [on] all hills H2022 that shall be digged H5737 (8735) with the mattock H4576, there shall not come thither H0935 (8799) the fear H3374 of briers H8068 and thorns H7898: but it shall be for the sending forth H4916 of oxen H7794, and for the treading H4823 of lesser cattle H7716.
008:001 ¶  Moreover the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto me, Take H3947 (8798) thee a great H1419 roll H1549, and write H3789 (8798) in it with a man’s H0582 pen H2747 concerning Mahershalalhashbaz H4122.
008:002 And I took H5749 unto me faithful H0539 (8737) witnesses H5707 to record H5749 (8686), Uriah H0223 the priest H3548, and Zechariah H2148 the son H1121 of Jeberechiah H3000.
008:003 And I went H7126 (8799) unto the prophetess H5031; and she conceived H2029 (8799), and bare H3205 (8799) a son H1121. Then said H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068 to me, Call H7121 (8798) his name H8034 Mahershalalhashbaz H4122.
008:004 For before the child H5288 shall have knowledge H3045 (8799) to cry H7121 (8800), My father H0001, and my mother H0517, the riches H2428 of Damascus H1834 and the spoil H7998 of Samaria H8111 shall be taken away H5375 (8799) before H6440 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
008:005 The LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8763) also unto me again H3254 (8686), saying H0559 (8800),
008:006 Forasmuch H3282 as this people H5971 refuseth H3988 (8804) the waters H4325 of Shiloah H7975 that go H1980 (8802) softly H0328, and rejoice H4885 in Rezin H7526 and Remaliah’s H7425 son H1121;
008:007 Now therefore, behold, the Lord H0136 bringeth up H5927 (8688) upon them the waters H4325 of the river H5104, strong H6099 and many H7227, [even] the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, and all his glory H3519: and he shall come up H5927 (8804) over all his channels H0650, and go over H1980 (8804) all his banks H1415:
008:008 And he shall pass H2498 (8804) through Judah H3063; he shall overflow H7857 (8804) and go over H5674 (8804), he shall reach H5060 (8686) [even] to the neck H6677; and the stretching out H4298 of his wings H3671 shall fill H4393 the breadth H7341 of thy land H0776, O Immanuel H6005 H0410.
008:009 Associate H7489 (8798) yourselves, O ye people H5971, and ye shall be broken in pieces H2865 (8798); and give ear H0238 (8685), all H3605 ye of far H4801 countries H0776: gird H0247 (8690) yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces H2865 (8798); gird H0247 (8690) yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces H2865 (8798).
008:010 Take H5779 counsel H6098 together H5779 (8798), and it shall come to nought H6565 (8714); speak H1696 (8761) the word H1697, and it shall not stand H6965 (8799): for God H0410 [is] with us.
008:011 For the LORD H3068 spake H0559 (8804) thus to me with a strong H2393 hand H3027, and instructed H3256 (8765) me that I should not walk H3212 (8800) in the way H1870 of this people H5971, saying H0559 (8800),
008:012 Say H0559 (8799) ye not, A confederacy H7195, to all [them to] whom this people H5971 shall say H0559 (8799), A confederacy H7195; neither fear H3372 (8799) ye their fear H4172, nor be afraid H6206 (8686).
008:013 Sanctify H6942 (8686) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 himself; and [let] him [be] your fear H4172, and [let] him [be] your dread H6206 (8688).
008:014 And he shall be for a sanctuary H4720; but for a stone H0068 of stumbling H5063 and for a rock H6697 of offence H4383 to both H8147 the houses H1004 of Israel H3478, for a gin H6341 and for a snare H4170 to the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389.
008:015 And many H7227 among them shall stumble H3782 (8804), and fall H5307 (8804), and be broken H7665 (8738), and be snared H3369 (8738), and be taken H3920 (8738).
008:016 Bind up H6887 (8798) the testimony H8584, seal H2856 (8798) the law H8451 among my disciples H3928.
008:017 And I will wait H2442 (8765) upon the LORD H3068, that hideth H5641 (8688) his face H6440 from the house H1004 of Jacob H3290, and I will look H6960 (8765) for him.
008:018 Behold, I and the children H3206 whom the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8804) me [are] for signs H0226 and for wonders H4159 in Israel H3478 from the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, which dwelleth H7931 (8802) in mount H2022 Zion H6726.
008:019 And when they shall say H0559 (8799) unto you, Seek H1875 (8798) unto them that have familiar spirits H0178, and unto wizards H3049 that peep H6850 (8772), and that mutter H1897 (8688): should not a people H5971 seek H1875 (8799) unto their God H0430? for the living H2416 to the dead H4191 (8801)?
008:020 To the law H8451 and to the testimony H8584: if they speak H0559 (8799) not according to this word H1697, [it is] because [there is] no light H7837 in them.
008:021 And they shall pass H5674 (8804) through it, hardly bestead H7185 (8737) and hungry H7457: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry H7456 (8799), they shall fret H7107 (8694) themselves, and curse H7043 (8765) their king H4428 and their God H0430, and look H6437 (8804) upward H4605.
008:022 And they shall look H5027 (8686) unto the earth H0776; and behold trouble H6869 and darkness H2825, dimness H4588 of anguish H6695; and [they shall be] driven H5080 (8794) to darkness H0653.
009:001 ¶  Nevertheless the dimness H4155 [shall] not [be] such as [was] in her vexation H4164, when H6256 at the first H7223 he lightly afflicted H7043 (8689) the land H0776 of Zebulun H2074 and the land H0776 of Naphtali H5321, and afterward H0314 did more grievously afflict H3513 (8689) [her by] the way H1870 of the sea H3220, beyond H5676 Jordan H3383, in Galilee H1551 of the nations H1471.
009:002 The people H5971 that walked H1980 (8802) in darkness H2822 have seen H7200 (8804) a great H1419 light H0216: they that dwell H3427 (8802) in the land H0776 of the shadow of death H6757, upon them hath the light H0216 shined H5050 (8804).
009:003 Thou hast multiplied H7235 (8689) the nation H1471, [and] not increased H1431 (8689) the joy H8057: they joy H8055 (8804) before H6440 thee according to the joy H8057 in harvest H7105, [and] as [men] rejoice H1523 (8799) when they divide H2505 (8763) the spoil H7998.
009:004 For thou hast broken H2865 (8689) the yoke H5923 of his burden H5448, and the staff H4294 of his shoulder H7926, the rod H7626 of his oppressor H5065 (8802), as in the day H3117 of Midian H4080.
009:005 For every battle H5430 of the warrior H5431 (8802) [is] with confused noise H7494, and garments H8071 rolled H1556 (8775) in blood H1818; but [this] shall be with burning H8316 [and] fuel H3980 of fire H0784.
009:006 For unto us a child H3206 is born H3205 (8795), unto us a son H1121 is given H5414 (8738): and the government H4951 shall be upon his shoulder H7926: and his name H8034 shall be called H7121 (8799) Wonderful H6382, Counsellor H3289 (8802), The mighty H1368 God H0410, The everlasting H5703 Father H0001, The Prince H8269 of Peace H7965.
009:007 Of the increase H4766 of [his] government H4951 and peace H7965 [there shall be] no end H7093, upon the throne H3678 of David H1732, and upon his kingdom H4467, to order H3559 (8687) it, and to establish H5582 (8800) it with judgment H4941 and with justice H6666 from henceforth even for H5704 ever H5769. The zeal H7068 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 will perform H6213 (8799) this.
009:008 The Lord H0136 sent H7971 (8804) a word H1697 into Jacob H3290, and it hath lighted H5307 (8804) upon Israel H3478.
009:009 And all the people H5971 shall know H3045 (8804), [even] Ephraim H0669 and the inhabitant H3427 (8802) of Samaria H8111, that say H0559 (8800) in the pride H1346 and stoutness H1433 of heart H3824,
009:010 The bricks H3843 are fallen down H5307 (8804), but we will build H1129 (8799) with hewn stones H1496: the sycomores H8256 are cut down H1438 (8795), but we will change H2498 (8686) [them into] cedars H0730.
009:011 Therefore the LORD H3068 shall set up H7682 (8762) the adversaries H6862 of Rezin H7526 against him, and join H5526 his enemies H0341 (8802) together H5526 (8770);
009:012 The Syrians H0758 before H6924, and the Philistines H6430 behind H0268; and they shall devour H0398 (8799) Israel H3478 with open mouth H6310. For all this his anger H0639 is not turned away H7725 (8804), but his hand H3027 [is] stretched out still H5186 (8803).
009:013 For the people H5971 turneth H7725 (8804) not unto him that smiteth H5221 (8688) them, neither do they seek H1875 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
009:014 Therefore the LORD H3068 will cut off H3772 (8686) from Israel H3478 head H7218 and tail H2180, branch H3712 and rush H0100, in one H0259 day H3117.
009:015 The ancient H2205 and honourable H6440 H5375 (8803), he H1931 [is] the head H7218; and the prophet H5030 that teacheth H3384 (8688) lies H8267, he [is] the tail H2180.
009:016 For the leaders H0833 (8764) of this people H5971 cause [them] to err H8582 (8688); and [they that are] led H0833 (8794) of them [are] destroyed H1104 (8794).
009:017 Therefore the Lord H0136 shall have no joy H8055 (8799) in their young men H0970, neither shall have mercy H7355 (8762) on their fatherless H3490 and widows H0490: for every one [is] an hypocrite H2611 and an evildoer H7489 (8688), and every mouth H6310 speaketh H1696 (8802) folly H5039. For all this his anger H0639 is not turned away H7725 (8804), but his hand H3027 [is] stretched out still H5186 (8803).
009:018 For wickedness H7564 burneth H1197 (8804) as the fire H0784: it shall devour H0398 (8799) the briers H8068 and thorns H7898, and shall kindle H3341 (8799) in the thickets H5442 of the forest H3293, and they shall mount up H0055 (8691) [like] the lifting up H1348 of smoke H6227.
009:019 Through the wrath H5678 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 is the land H0776 darkened H6272 (8738), and the people H5971 shall be as the fuel H3980 of the fire H0784: no man H0376 shall spare H2550 (8799) his brother H0251.
009:020 And he shall snatch H1504 (8799) on the right hand H3225, and be hungry H7457; and he shall eat H0398 (8799) on the left hand H8040, and they shall not be satisfied H7646 (8804): they shall eat H0398 (8799) every man H0376 the flesh H1320 of his own arm H2220:
009:021 Manasseh H4519, Ephraim H0669; and Ephraim H0669, Manasseh H4519: [and] they together H3162 [shall be] against Judah H3063. For all this his anger H0639 is not turned away H7725 (8804), but his hand H3027 [is] stretched out still H5186 (8803).
010:001 ¶  Woe H1945 unto them that decree H2710 (8802) unrighteous H0205 decrees H2711, and that write H3789 (8764) grievousness H5999 [which] they have prescribed H3789 (8765);
010:002 To turn aside H5186 (8687) the needy H1800 from judgment H1779, and to take away H1497 (8800) the right H4941 from the poor H6041 of my people H5971, that widows H0490 may be their prey H7998, and [that] they may rob H0962 (8799) the fatherless H3490!
010:003 And what will ye do H6213 (8799) in the day H3117 of visitation H6486, and in the desolation H7722 [which] shall come H0935 (8799) from far H4801? to whom will ye flee H5127 (8799) for help H5833? and where will ye leave H5800 (8799) your glory H3519?
010:004 Without me they shall H1115 bow down H3766 (8804) under the prisoners H0616, and they shall fall H5307 (8799) under the slain H2026 (8803). For all this his anger H0639 is not turned away H7725 (8804), but his hand H3027 [is] stretched out still H5186 (8803).
010:005 O H1945 Assyrian H0804, the rod H7626 of mine anger H0639, and the staff H4294 in their hand H3027 is mine indignation H2195.
010:006 I will send H7971 (8762) him against an hypocritical H2611 nation H1471, and against the people H5971 of my wrath H5678 will I give him a charge H6680 (8762), to take H7997 (8800) the spoil H7998, and to take H0962 (8800) the prey H0957, and to tread them down H7760 (8800) H4823 like the mire H2563 of the streets H2351.
010:007 Howbeit he meaneth H1819 (8762) not so, neither doth his heart H3824 think H2803 (8799) so; but [it is] in his heart H3824 to destroy H8045 (8687) and cut off H3772 (8687) nations H1471 not a few H4592.
010:008 For he saith H0559 (8799), [Are] not my princes H8269 altogether H3162 kings H4428?
010:009 [Is] not Calno H3641 as Carchemish H3751? [is] not Hamath H2574 as Arpad H0774? [is] not Samaria H8111 as Damascus H1834?
010:010 As my hand H3027 hath found H4672 (8804) the kingdoms H4467 of the idols H0457, and whose graven images H6456 did excel them of Jerusalem H3389 and of Samaria H8111;
010:011 Shall I not, as I have done H6213 (8804) unto Samaria H8111 and her idols H0457, so do H6213 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389 and her idols H6091?
010:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, [that] when the Lord H0136 hath performed H1214 (8762) his whole work H4639 upon mount H2022 Zion H6726 and on Jerusalem H3389, I will punish H6485 (8799) the fruit H6529 of the stout H1433 heart H3824 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, and the glory H8597 of his high H7312 looks H5869.
010:013 For he saith H0559 (8804), By the strength H3581 of my hand H3027 I have done H6213 (8804) [it], and by my wisdom H2451; for I am prudent H0995 (8738): and I have removed H5493 (8686) the bounds H1367 of the people H5971, and have robbed H8154 (8782) their treasures H6259 (8675) H6264, and I have put down H3381 (8686) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) like a valiant H0047 H3524 [man]:
010:014 And my hand H3027 hath found H4672 (8799) as a nest H7064 the riches H2428 of the people H5971: and as one gathereth H0622 (8800) eggs H1000 [that are] left H5800 (8803), have I gathered H0622 (8804) all the earth H0776; and there was none that moved H5074 (8802) the wing H3671, or opened H6475 (8802) the mouth H6310, or peeped H6850 (8772).
010:015 Shall the axe H1631 boast H6286 (8691) itself against him that heweth H2672 (8802) therewith? [or] shall the saw H4883 magnify H1431 (8691) itself against him that shaketh H5130 (8688) it? as if the rod H7626 should shake H5130 (8687) [itself] against them that lift it up H7311 (8688), [or] as if the staff H4294 should lift up H7311 (8687) [itself, as if it were] no wood H6086.
010:016 Therefore shall the Lord H0113, the Lord H0136 (8676) H3068 of hosts H6635, send H7971 (8762) among his fat ones H4924 leanness H7332; and under his glory H3519 he shall kindle H3344 (8799) a burning H3350 like the burning of a fire H0784.
010:017 And the light H0216 of Israel H3478 shall be for a fire H0784, and his Holy One H6918 for a flame H3852: and it shall burn H1197 (8804) and devour H0398 (8804) his thorns H7898 and his briers H8068 in one H0259 day H3117;
010:018 And shall consume H3615 (8762) the glory H3519 of his forest H3293, and of his fruitful field H3759, both soul H5315 and body H1320: and they shall be as when a standardbearer H5263 (8802) fainteth H4549 (8800).
010:019 And the rest H7605 of the trees H6086 of his forest H3293 shall be few H4557, that a child H5288 may write H3789 (8799) them.
010:020 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] the remnant H7605 of Israel H3478, and such as are escaped H6413 of the house H1004 of Jacob H3290, shall no more again H3254 (8686) stay H8172 (8736) upon him that smote H5221 (8688) them; but shall stay H8172 (8738) upon the LORD H3068, the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478, in truth H0571.
010:021 The remnant H7605 shall return H7725 (8799), [even] the remnant H7605 of Jacob H3290, unto the mighty H1368 God H0410.
010:022 For though thy people H5971 Israel H3478 be as the sand H2344 of the sea H3220, [yet] a remnant H7605 of them shall return H7725 (8799): the consumption H3631 decreed H2782 (8803) shall overflow H7857 (8802) with righteousness H6666.
010:023 For the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635 shall make H6213 (8802) a consumption H3617, even determined H2782 (8737), in the midst H7130 of all the land H0776.
010:024 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635, O my people H5971 that dwellest H3427 (8802) in Zion H6726, be not afraid H3372 (8799) of the Assyrian H0804: he shall smite H5221 (8686) thee with a rod H7626, and shall lift up H5375 (8799) his staff H4294 against thee, after the manner H1870 of Egypt H4714.
010:025 For yet a very H4213 little while H4592, and the indignation H2195 shall cease H3615 (8804), and mine anger H0639 in their destruction H8399.
010:026 And the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 shall stir up H5782 (8790) a scourge H7752 for him according to the slaughter H4347 of Midian H4080 at the rock H6697 of Oreb H6159: and [as] his rod H4294 [was] upon the sea H3220, so shall he lift it up H5375 (8804) after the manner H1870 of Egypt H4714.
010:027 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] his burden H5448 shall be taken away H5493 (8799) from off thy shoulder H7926, and his yoke H5923 from off thy neck H6677, and the yoke H5923 shall be destroyed H2254 (8795) because H6440 of the anointing H8081.
010:028 He is come H0935 (8804) to Aiath H5857, he is passed H5674 (8804) to Migron H4051; at Michmash H4363 he hath laid up H6485 (8686) his carriages H3627:
010:029 They are gone over H5674 (8804) the passage H4569: they have taken up their lodging H4411 at Geba H1387; Ramah H7414 is afraid H2729 (8804); Gibeah H1390 of Saul H7586 is fled H5127 (8804).
010:030 Lift up H6670 (8761) thy voice H6963, O daughter H1323 of H1530 Gallim H1554: cause it to be heard H7181 (8685) unto Laish H3919, O poor H6041 Anathoth H6068.
010:031 Madmenah H4088 is removed H5074 (8804); the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Gebim H1374 gather themselves to flee H5756 (8689).
010:032 As yet shall he remain H5975 (8800) at Nob H5011 that day H3117: he shall shake H5130 (8787) his hand H3027 [against] the mount H2022 of the daughter H1323 (8675) H1004 of Zion H6726, the hill H1389 of Jerusalem H3389.
010:033 Behold, the Lord H0113, the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, shall lop H5586 (8764) the bough H6288 with terror H4637: and the high ones H7311 (8802) of stature H6967 [shall be] hewn down H1438 (8803), and the haughty H1364 shall be humbled H8213 (8799).
010:034 And he shall cut down H5362 (8765) the thickets H5442 of the forest H3293 with iron H1270, and Lebanon H3844 shall fall H5307 (8799) by a mighty one H0117.
011:001 ¶  And there shall come forth H3318 (8804) a rod H2415 out of the stem H1503 of Jesse H3448, and a Branch H5342 shall grow H6509 (8799) out of his roots H8328:
011:002 And the spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 shall rest H5117 (8804) upon him, the spirit H7307 of wisdom H2451 and understanding H0998, the spirit H7307 of counsel H6098 and might H1369, the spirit H7307 of knowledge H1847 and of the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068;
011:003 And shall make him of quick understanding H7306 (8687) in the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068: and he shall not judge H8199 (8799) after the sight H4758 of his eyes H5869, neither reprove H3198 (8686) after the hearing H4926 of his ears H0241:
011:004 But with righteousness H6664 shall he judge H8199 (8804) the poor H1800, and reprove H3198 (8689) with equity H4334 for the meek H6035 of the earth H0776: and he shall smite H5221 (8689) the earth H0776 with the rod H7626 of his mouth H6310, and with the breath H7307 of his lips H8193 shall he slay H4191 (8686) the wicked H7563.
011:005 And righteousness H6664 shall be the girdle H0232 of his loins H4975, and faithfulness H0530 the girdle H0232 of his reins H2504.
011:006 The wolf H2061 also shall dwell H1481 (8804) with the lamb H3532, and the leopard H5246 shall lie down H7257 (8799) with the kid H1423; and the calf H5695 and the young lion H3715 and the fatling H4806 together H3162; and a little H6996 child H5288 shall lead H5090 (8802) them.
011:007 And the cow H6510 and the bear H1677 shall feed H7462 (8799); their young ones H3206 shall lie down H7257 (8799) together H3162: and the lion H0738 shall eat H0398 (8799) straw H8401 like the ox H1241.
011:008 And the sucking child H3243 (8802) shall play H8173 (8773) on the hole H2352 of the asp H6620, and the weaned child H1580 (8803) shall put H1911 (8804) his hand H3027 on the cockatrice H6848 ’ den H3975.
011:009 They shall not hurt H7489 (8686) nor destroy H7843 (8686) in all my holy H6944 mountain H2022: for the earth H0776 shall be full H4390 (8804) of the knowledge H1844 of the LORD H3068, as the waters H4325 cover H3680 (8764) the sea H3220.
011:010 And in that day H3117 there shall be a root H8328 of Jesse H3448, which shall stand H5975 (8802) for an ensign H5251 of the people H5971; to it shall the Gentiles H1471 seek H1875 (8799): and his rest H4496 shall be glorious H3519.
011:011 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] the Lord H0136 shall set H3254 his hand H3027 again H3254 (8686) the second time H8145 to recover H7069 (8800) the remnant H7605 of his people H5971, which shall be left H7604 (8735), from Assyria H0804, and from Egypt H4714, and from Pathros H6624, and from Cush H3568, and from Elam H5867, and from Shinar H8152, and from Hamath H2574, and from the islands H0339 of the sea H3220.
011:012 And he shall set up H5375 (8804) an ensign H5251 for the nations H1471, and shall assemble H0622 (8804) the outcasts H1760 (8737) of Israel H3478, and gather together H6908 (8762) the dispersed H5310 (8803) of Judah H3063 from the four H0702 corners H3671 of the earth H0776.
011:013 The envy H7068 also of Ephraim H0669 shall depart H5493 (8804), and the adversaries H6887 (8802) of Judah H3063 shall be cut off H3772 (8735): Ephraim H0669 shall not envy H7065 (8762) Judah H3063, and Judah H3063 shall not vex H6887 (8799) Ephraim H0669.
011:014 But they shall fly H5774 (8804) upon the shoulders H3802 of the Philistines H6430 toward the west H3220; they shall spoil H0962 (8799) them H1121 of the east H6924 together H3162: they shall lay H4916 their hand H3027 upon Edom H0123 and Moab H4124; and the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 shall obey H4928 them.
011:015 And the LORD H3068 shall utterly destroy H2763 (8689) the tongue H3956 of the Egyptian H4714 sea H3220; and with his mighty H5868 wind H7307 shall he shake H5130 (8689) his hand H3027 over the river H5104, and shall smite H5221 (8689) it in the seven H7651 streams H5158, and make [men] go over H1869 (8689) dryshod H5275.
011:016 And there shall be an highway H4546 for the remnant H7605 of his people H5971, which H0834 shall be left H7604 (8735), from Assyria H0804; like as it was to Israel H3478 in the day H3117 that he came up H5927 (8800) out of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714.
012:001 ¶  And in that day H3117 thou shalt say H0559 (8804), O LORD H3068, I will praise H3034 (8686) thee: though thou wast angry H0599 (8804) with me, thine anger H0639 is turned away H7725 (8799), and thou comfortedst H5162 (8762) me.
012:002 Behold, God H0410 [is] my salvation H3444; I will trust H0982 (8799), and not be afraid H6342 (8799): for the LORD H3050 JEHOVAH H3068 [is] my strength H5797 and [my] song H2176; he also is become my salvation H3444.
012:003 Therefore with joy H8342 shall ye draw H7579 (8804) water H4325 out of the wells H4599 of salvation H3444.
012:004 And in that day H3117 shall ye say H0559 (8804), Praise H3034 (8685) the LORD H3068, call H7121 (8798) upon his name H8034, declare H3045 (8685) his doings H5949 among the people H5971, make mention H2142 (8685) that his name H8034 is exalted H7682 (8737).
012:005 Sing H2167 (8761) unto the LORD H3068; for he hath done H6213 (8804) excellent things H1348: this [is] known H3045 (8716) (8675) H3045 (8794) in all the earth H0776.
012:006 Cry out H6670 (8761) and shout H7442 (8798), thou inhabitant H3427 (8802) of Zion H6726: for great H1419 [is] the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478 in the midst H7130 of thee.
013:001 ¶  The burden H4853 of Babylon H0894, which Isaiah H3470 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531 did see H2372 (8804).
013:002 Lift ye up H5375 (8798) a banner H5251 upon the high H8192 (8737) mountain H2022, exalt H7311 (8685) the voice H6963 unto them, shake H5130 (8685) the hand H3027, that they may go H0935 (8799) into the gates H6607 of the nobles H5081.
013:003 I have commanded H6680 (8765) my sanctified ones H6942 (8794), I have also called H7121 (8804) my mighty ones H1368 for mine anger H0639, [even] them that rejoice H5947 in my highness H1346.
013:004 The noise H6963 of a multitude H1995 in the mountains H2022, like as H1823 of a great H7227 people H5971; a tumultuous H7588 noise H6963 of the kingdoms H4467 of nations H1471 gathered together H0622 (8737): the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 mustereth H6485 (8764) the host H6635 of the battle H4421.
013:005 They come H0935 (8802) from a far H4801 country H0776, from the end H7097 of heaven H8064, [even] the LORD H3068, and the weapons H3627 of his indignation H2195, to destroy H2254 (8763) the whole land H0776.
013:006 Howl H3213 (8685) ye; for the day H3117 of the LORD H3068 [is] at hand H7138; it shall come H0935 (8799) as a destruction H7701 from the Almighty H7706.
013:007 Therefore shall all hands H3027 be faint H7503 (8799), and every man’s H0582 heart H3824 shall melt H4549 (8735):
013:008 And they shall be afraid H0926 (8738): pangs H6735 and sorrows H2256 shall take hold H0270 (8799) of them; they shall be in pain H2342 (8799) as a woman that travaileth H3205 (8802): they shall be amazed H8539 (8799) one H0376 at another H7453; their faces H6440 [shall be as] flames H3851.
013:009 Behold, the day H3117 of the LORD H3068 cometh H0935 (8804), cruel H0394 both with wrath H5678 and fierce H2740 anger H0639, to lay H7760 (8800) the land H0776 desolate H8047: and he shall destroy H8045 (8686) the sinners H2400 thereof out of it.
013:010 For the stars H3556 of heaven H8064 and the constellations H3685 thereof shall not give H1984 (8686) their light H0216: the sun H8121 shall be darkened H2821 (8804) in his going forth H3318 (8800), and the moon H3394 shall not cause her light H0216 to shine H5050 (8686).
013:011 And I will punish H6485 (8804) the world H8398 for [their] evil H7451, and the wicked H7563 for their iniquity H5771; and I will cause the arrogancy H1347 of the proud H2086 to cease H7673 (8689), and will lay low H8213 (8686) the haughtiness H1346 of the terrible H6184.
013:012 I will make a man H0582 more precious H3365 (8686) than fine gold H6337; even a man H0120 than the golden wedge H3800 of Ophir H0211.
013:013 Therefore I will shake H7264 (8686) the heavens H8064, and the earth H0776 shall remove H7493 (8799) out of her place H4725, in the wrath H5678 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, and in the day H3117 of his fierce H2740 anger H0639.
013:014 And it shall be as the chased H5080 (8716) roe H6643, and as a sheep H6629 that no man taketh up H6908 (8764): they shall every man H0376 turn H6437 (8799) to his own people H5971, and flee H5127 (8799) every one H0376 into his own land H0776.
013:015 Every one that is found H4672 (8737) shall be thrust through H1856 (8735); and every one that is joined H5595 (8737) [unto them] shall fall H5307 (8799) by the sword H2719.
013:016 Their children H5768 also shall be dashed to pieces H7376 (8792) before their eyes H5869; their houses H1004 shall be spoiled H8155 (8735), and their wives H0802 ravished H7901 (8735) (8675) H7693 (8735).
013:017 Behold, I will stir up H5782 (8688) the Medes H4074 against them, which shall not regard H2803 (8799) silver H3701; and [as for] gold H2091, they shall not delight H2654 (8799) in it.
013:018 [Their] bows H7198 also shall dash H7376 the young men H5288 to pieces H7376 (8762); and they shall have no pity H7355 (8762) on the fruit H6529 of the womb H0990; their eye H5869 shall not spare H2347 (8799) children H1121.
013:019 And Babylon H0894, the glory H6643 of kingdoms H4467, the beauty H8597 of the Chaldees H3778 ’ excellency H1347, shall be as when God H0430 overthrew H4114 Sodom H5467 and Gomorrah H6017.
013:020 It shall never H5331 be inhabited H3427 (8799), neither shall it be dwelt H7931 (8799) in from generation H1755 to generation H1755: neither shall the Arabian H6163 pitch tent H0167 (8762) there; neither shall the shepherds H7462 (8802) make their fold H7257 (8686) there.
013:021 But wild beasts of the desert H6728 shall lie H7257 (8804) there; and their houses H1004 shall be full H4390 (8804) of doleful creatures H0255; and owls H1323 H3284 shall dwell H7931 (8804) there, and satyrs H8163 shall dance H7540 (8762) there.
013:022 And the wild beasts of the islands H0338 shall cry H6030 (8804) in their desolate houses H0490, and dragons H8577 in [their] pleasant H6027 palaces H1964: and her time H6256 [is] near H7138 to come H0935 (8800), and her days H3117 shall not be prolonged H4900 (8735).
014:001 ¶  For the LORD H3068 will have mercy H7355 (8762) on Jacob H3290, and will yet choose H0977 (8804) Israel H3478, and set H3240 (8689) them in their own land H0127: and the strangers H1616 shall be joined H3867 (8738) with them, and they shall cleave H5596 (8738) to the house H1004 of Jacob H3290.
014:002 And the people H5971 shall take H3947 (8804) them, and bring H0935 (8689) them to their place H4725: and the house H1004 of Israel H3478 shall possess H5157 (8694) them in the land H0127 of the LORD H3068 for servants H5650 and handmaids H8198: and they shall take them captives H7617 (8802), whose captives H7617 (8802) they were; and they shall rule H7287 (8804) over their oppressors H5065 (8802).
014:003 And it shall come to pass in the day H3117 that the LORD H3068 shall give thee rest H5117 (8687) from thy sorrow H6090, and from thy fear H7267, and from the hard H7186 bondage H5656 wherein thou wast made to serve H5647 (8795),
014:004 That thou shalt take up H5375 (8804) this proverb H4912 against the king H4428 of Babylon H0894, and say H0559 (8804), How hath the oppressor H5065 (8802) ceased H7673 (8804)! the golden city H4062 ceased H7673 (8804)!
014:005 The LORD H3068 hath broken H7665 (8804) the staff H4294 of the wicked H7563, [and] the sceptre H7626 of the rulers H4910 (8802).
014:006 He who smote H5221 (8688) the people H5971 in wrath H5678 with a continual H1115 H5627 stroke H4347, he that ruled H7287 (8802) the nations H1471 in anger H0639, is persecuted H4783, [and] none H1097 hindereth H2820 (8804).
014:007 The whole earth H0776 is at rest H5117 (8804), [and] is quiet H8252 (8804): they break forth H6476 (8804) into singing H7440.
014:008 Yea, the fir trees H1265 rejoice H8055 (8804) at thee, [and] the cedars H0730 of Lebanon H3844, [saying], Since thou art laid down H7901 (8804), no feller H3772 (8802) is come up H5927 (8799) against us.
014:009 Hell H7585 from beneath is moved H7264 (8804) for thee to meet H7125 (8800) [thee] at thy coming H0935 (8800): it stirreth up H5782 (8790) the dead H7496 for thee, [even] all the chief ones H6260 of the earth H0776; it hath raised up H6965 (8689) from their thrones H3678 all the kings H4428 of the nations H1471.
014:010 All they shall speak H6030 (8799) and say H0559 (8799) unto thee, Art thou also become weak H2470 (8795) as we? art thou become like H4911 (8738) unto us?
014:011 Thy pomp H1347 is brought down H3381 (8717) to the grave H7585, [and] the noise H1998 of thy viols H5035: the worm H7415 is spread H3331 (8714) under thee, and the worms H8438 cover H4374 thee.
014:012 How art thou fallen H5307 (8804) from heaven H8064, O Lucifer H1966, son H1121 of the morning H7837 (8676) H3213 (8685)! [how] art thou cut down H1438 (8738) to the ground H0776, which didst weaken H2522 (8802) the nations H1471!
014:013 For thou hast said H0559 (8804) in thine heart H3824, I will ascend H5927 (8799) into heaven H8064, I will exalt H7311 (8686) my throne H3678 above H4605 the stars H3556 of God H0410: I will sit H3427 (8799) also upon the mount H2022 of the congregation H4150, in the sides H3411 of the north H6828:
014:014 I will ascend H5927 (8799) above the heights H1116 of the clouds H5645; I will be like H1819 (8691) the most High H5945.
014:015 Yet thou shalt be brought down H3381 (8714) to hell H7585, to the sides H3411 of the pit H0953.
014:016 They that see H7200 (8802) thee shall narrowly look H7688 (8686) upon thee, [and] consider H0995 (8709) thee, [saying, Is] this the man H0376 that made the earth H0776 to tremble H7264 (8688), that did shake H7493 (8688) kingdoms H4467;
014:017 [That] made H7760 (8804) the world H8398 as a wilderness H4057, and destroyed H2040 (8804) the cities H5892 thereof; [that] opened H6605 (8804) not the house H1004 of his prisoners H0615?
014:018 All the kings H4428 of the nations H1471, [even] all of them, lie H7901 (8804) in glory H3519, every one H0376 in his own house H1004.
014:019 But thou art cast out H7993 (8717) of thy grave H6913 like an abominable H8581 (8737) branch H5342, [and as] the raiment H3830 of those that are slain H2026 (8803), thrust through H2944 (8794) with a sword H2719, that go down H3381 (8802) to the stones H0068 of the pit H0953; as a carcase H6297 trodden under feet H0947 (8716).
014:020 Thou shalt not be joined H3161 (8799) with them in burial H6900, because thou hast destroyed H7843 (8765) thy land H0776, [and] slain H2026 (8804) thy people H5971: the seed H2233 of evildoers H7489 (8688) shall never H5769 be renowned H7121 (8735).
014:021 Prepare H3559 (8685) slaughter H4293 for his children H1121 for the iniquity H5771 of their fathers H0001; that they do not H1077 rise H6965 (8799), nor possess H3423 (8804) the land H0776, nor fill H4390 (8804) the face H6440 of the world H8398 with cities H6145 (8676) H5892.
014:022 For I will rise up H6965 (8804) against them, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, and cut off H3772 (8689) from Babylon H0894 the name H8034, and remnant H7605, and son H5209, and nephew H5220, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
014:023 I will also make H7760 (8804) it a possession H4180 for the bittern H7090, and pools H0098 of water H4325: and I will sweep H2894 (8773) it with the besom H4292 of destruction H8045 (8687), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
014:024 The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 hath sworn H7650 (8738), saying H0559 (8800), Surely as I have thought H1819 (8765), so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed H3289 (8804), [so] shall it stand H6965 (8799):
014:025 That I will break H7665 (8800) the Assyrian H0804 in my land H0776, and upon my mountains H2022 tread him under foot H0947 (8799): then shall his yoke H5923 depart H5493 (8804) from off them, and his burden H5448 depart H5493 (8799) from off their shoulders H7926.
014:026 This [is] the purpose H6098 that is purposed H3289 (8803) upon the whole earth H0776: and this [is] the hand H3027 that is stretched out H5186 (8803) upon all the nations H1471.
014:027 For the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 hath purposed H3289 (8804), and who shall disannul H6565 (8686) [it]? and his hand H3027 [is] stretched out H5186 (8803), and who shall turn it back H7725 (8686)?
014:028 In the year H8141 that king H4428 Ahaz H0271 died H4194 was this burden H4853.
014:029 Rejoice H8055 (8799) not thou, whole Palestina H6429, because the rod H7626 of him that smote H5221 (8688) thee is broken H7665 (8738): for out of the serpent’s H5175 root H8328 shall come forth H3318 (8799) a cockatrice H6848, and his fruit H6529 [shall be] a fiery H8314 flying H5774 (8789) serpent H8314.
014:030 And the firstborn H1060 of the poor H1800 shall feed H7462 (8804), and the needy H0034 shall lie down H7257 (8799) in safety H0983: and I will kill H4191 (8689) thy root H8328 with famine H7458, and he shall slay H2026 (8799) thy remnant H7611.
014:031 Howl H3213 (8685), O gate H8179; cry H2199 (8798), O city H5892; thou, whole Palestina H6429, [art] dissolved H4127 (8738): for there shall come H0935 (8804) from the north H6828 a smoke H6227, and none [shall be] alone H0909 (8802) in his appointed times H4151.
014:032 What shall [one] then answer H6030 (8799) the messengers H4397 of the nation H1471? That the LORD H3068 hath founded H3245 (8765) Zion H6726, and the poor H6041 of his people H5971 shall trust H2620 (8799) in it.
015:001 ¶  The burden H4853 of Moab H4124. Because in the night H3915 Ar H6144 of Moab H4124 is laid waste H7703 (8795), [and] brought to silence H1820 (8738); because in the night H3915 Kir H7024 of Moab H4124 is laid waste H7703 (8795), [and] brought to silence H1820 (8738);
015:002 He is gone up H5927 (8804) to Bajith H1006, and to Dibon H1769, the high places H1116, to weep H1065: Moab H4124 shall howl H3213 (8686) over Nebo H5015, and over Medeba H4311: on all their heads H7218 [shall be] baldness H7144, [and] every beard H2206 cut off H1438 (8803).
015:003 In their streets H2351 they shall gird H2296 (8804) themselves with sackcloth H8242: on the tops H1406 of their houses, and in their streets H7339, every one shall howl H3213 (8686), weeping H1065 abundantly H3381 (8802).
015:004 And Heshbon H2809 shall cry H2199 (8799), and Elealeh H0500: their voice H6963 shall be heard H8085 (8738) [even] unto Jahaz H3096: therefore the armed soldiers H2502 (8803) of Moab H4124 shall cry out H7321 (8686); his life H5315 shall be grievous H3415 (8804) unto him.
015:005 My heart H3820 shall cry out H2199 (8799) for Moab H4124; his fugitives H1280 [shall flee] unto Zoar H6820, an heifer H5697 of three years old H7992: for by the mounting up H4608 of Luhith H3872 with weeping H1065 shall they go it up H5927 (8799); for in the way H1870 of Horonaim H2773 they shall raise up H5782 (8787) a cry H2201 of destruction H7667.
015:006 For the waters H4325 of Nimrim H5249 shall be desolate H4923: for the hay H2682 is withered away H3001 (8804), the grass H1877 faileth H3615 (8804), there is no green thing H3418.
015:007 Therefore the abundance H3502 they have gotten H6213 (8804), and that which they have laid up H6486, shall they carry away H5375 (8799) to the brook H5158 of the willows H6155.
015:008 For the cry H2201 is gone round about H5362 (8689) the borders H1366 of Moab H4124; the howling H3215 thereof unto Eglaim H0097, and the howling H3215 thereof unto Beerelim H0879.
015:009 For the waters H4325 of Dimon H1775 shall be full H4390 (8804) of blood H1818: for I will bring H7896 (8799) more H3254 (8737) upon Dimon H1775, lions H0738 upon him that escapeth H6413 of Moab H4124, and upon the remnant H7611 of the land H0127.
016:001 ¶  Send H7971 (8798) ye the lamb H3733 to the ruler H4910 (8802) of the land H0776 from Sela H5554 to the wilderness H4057, unto the mount H2022 of the daughter H1323 of Zion H6726.
016:002 For it shall be, [that], as a wandering H5074 (8802) bird H5775 cast out H7971 (8794) of the nest H7064, [so] the daughters H1323 of Moab H4124 shall be at the fords H4569 of Arnon H0769.
016:003 Take H0935 (8685) counsel H6098, execute H6213 (8798) judgment H6415; make H7896 (8798) thy shadow H6738 as the night H3915 in the midst H8432 of the noonday H6672; hide H5641 (8761) the outcasts H5080 (8737); bewray H1540 (8762) not him that wandereth H5074 (8802).
016:004 Let mine outcasts H5080 (8737) dwell H1481 (8799) with thee, Moab H4124; be H1933 (8798) thou a covert H5643 to them from the face H6440 of the spoiler H7703 (8802): for the extortioner H4160 (8801) is at an end H0656 (8804), the spoiler H7701 ceaseth H3615 (8804), the oppressors H7429 (8802) are consumed H8552 (8804) out of the land H0776.
016:005 And in mercy H2617 shall the throne H3678 be established H3559 (8717): and he shall sit H3427 (8804) upon it in truth H0571 in the tabernacle H0168 of David H1732, judging H8199 (8802), and seeking H1875 (8802) judgment H4941, and hasting H4106 righteousness H6664.
016:006 We have heard H8085 (8804) of the pride H1347 of Moab H4124; [he is] very H3966 proud H1341: [even] of his haughtiness H1346, and his pride H1347, and his wrath H5678: [but] his lies H0907 [shall] not [be] so.
016:007 Therefore shall Moab H4124 howl H3213 (8686) for Moab H4124, every one shall howl H3213 (8686): for the foundations H0808 of Kirhareseth H7025 shall ye mourn H1897 (8799); surely [they are] stricken H5218.
016:008 For the fields H7709 of Heshbon H2809 languish H0535 (8797), [and] the vine H1612 of Sibmah H7643: the lords H1167 of the heathen H1471 have broken down H1986 (8804) the principal plants H8291 thereof, they are come H5060 (8804) [even] unto Jazer H3270, they wandered H8582 (8804) [through] the wilderness H4057: her branches H7976 are stretched out H5203 (8738), they are gone over H5674 (8804) the sea H3220.
016:009 Therefore I will bewail H1058 (8799) with the weeping H1065 of Jazer H3270 the vine H1612 of Sibmah H7643: I will water H7301 (8762) thee with my tears H1832, O Heshbon H2809, and Elealeh H0500: for the shouting H1959 for thy summer fruits H7019 and for thy harvest H7105 is fallen H5307 (8804).
016:010 And gladness H8057 is taken away H0622 (8738), and joy H1524 out of the plentiful field H3759; and in the vineyards H3754 there shall be no singing H7442 (8792), neither shall there be shouting H7321 (8783): the treaders H1869 (8802) shall tread out H1869 (8799) no wine H3196 in [their] presses H3342; I have made [their vintage] shouting H1959 to cease H7673 (8689).
016:011 Wherefore my bowels H4578 shall sound H1993 (8799) like an harp H3658 for Moab H4124, and mine inward parts H7130 for Kirharesh H7025.
016:012 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen H7200 (8738) that Moab H4124 is weary H3811 (8738) on the high place H1116, that he shall come H0935 (8804) to his sanctuary H4720 to pray H6419 (8692); but he shall not prevail H3201 (8799).
016:013 This [is] the word H1697 that the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) concerning Moab H4124 since that time H0227.
016:014 But now the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), Within three H7969 years H8141, as the years H8141 of an hireling H7916, and the glory H3519 of Moab H4124 shall be contemned H7034 (8738), with all that great H7227 multitude H1995; and the remnant H7605 [shall be] very H4592 small H4213 [and] feeble H3808 H3524.
017:001 ¶  The burden H4853 of Damascus H1834. Behold, Damascus H1834 is taken away H5493 (8716) from [being] a city H5892, and it shall be a ruinous H4654 heap H4596.
017:002 The cities H5892 of Aroer H6177 [are] forsaken H5800 (8803): they shall be for flocks H5739, which shall lie down H7257 (8804), and none shall make [them] afraid H2729 (8688).
017:003 The fortress H4013 also shall cease H7673 (8738) from Ephraim H0669, and the kingdom H4467 from Damascus H1834, and the remnant H7605 of Syria H0758: they shall be as the glory H3519 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
017:004 And in that day H3117 it shall come to pass, [that] the glory H3519 of Jacob H3290 shall be made thin H1809 (8735), and the fatness H4924 of his flesh H1320 shall wax lean H7329 (8735).
017:005 And it shall be as when the harvestman H7105 gathereth H0622 (8800) the corn H7054, and reapeth H7114 (8799) the ears H7641 with his arm H2220; and it shall be as he that gathereth H3950 (8764) ears H7641 in the valley H6010 of Rephaim H7497.
017:006 Yet gleaning grapes H5955 shall be left H7604 (8738) in it, as the shaking H5363 of an olive tree H2132, two H8147 [or] three H7969 berries H1620 in the top H7218 of the uppermost bough H0534, four H0702 [or] five H2568 in the outmost fruitful H6509 (8802) branches H5585 thereof, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
017:007 At that day H3117 shall a man H0120 look H8159 (8799) to his Maker H6213 (8802), and his eyes H5869 shall have respect H7200 (8799) to the Holy H6918 One of Israel H3478.
017:008 And he shall not look H8159 (8799) to the altars H4196, the work H4639 of his hands H3027, neither shall respect H7200 (8799) [that] which his fingers H0676 have made H6213 (8804), either the groves H0842, or the images H2553.
017:009 In that day H3117 shall his strong H4581 cities H5892 be as a forsaken H5800 (8803) bough H2793, and an uppermost branch H0534, which they left H5800 (8804) because H6440 of the children H1121 of Israel H3478: and there shall be desolation H8077.
017:010 Because thou hast forgotten H7911 (8804) the God H0430 of thy salvation H3468, and hast not been mindful H2142 (8804) of the rock H6697 of thy strength H4581, therefore shalt thou plant H5193 (8799) pleasant H5282 plants H5194, and shalt set H2232 (8799) it with strange H2114 (8801) slips H2156:
017:011 In the day H3117 shalt thou make thy plant H5194 to grow H7735 (8770), and in the morning H1242 shalt thou make thy seed H2233 to flourish H6524 (8686): [but] the harvest H7105 [shall be] a heap H5067 in the day H3117 of grief H2470 (8737) and of desperate H0605 (8803) sorrow H3511.
017:012 Woe H1945 to the multitude H1995 of many H7227 people H5971, [which] make a noise H1993 (8799) like the noise H1993 (8800) of the seas H3220; and to the rushing H7588 of nations H3816, [that] make a rushing like the rushing H7582 (8735) of mighty H3524 waters H4325!
017:013 The nations H3816 shall rush H7582 (8735) like the rushing H7588 of many H7227 waters H4325: but [God] shall rebuke H1605 (8804) them, and they shall flee H5127 (8804) far off H4801, and shall be chased H7291 (8795) as the chaff H4671 of the mountains H2022 before H6440 the wind H7307, and like a rolling thing H1534 before H6440 the whirlwind H5492.
017:014 And behold at eveningtide H6256 H6153 trouble H1091; [and] before the morning H1242 he [is] not. This [is] the portion H2506 of them that spoil H8154 (8802) us, and the lot H1486 of them that rob H0962 (8802) us.
018:001 ¶  Woe H1945 to the land H0776 shadowing H6767 with wings H3671, which [is] beyond H5676 the rivers H5104 of Ethiopia H3568:
018:002 That sendeth H7971 (8802) ambassadors H6735 by the sea H3220, even in vessels H3627 of bulrushes H1573 upon H6440 the waters H4325, [saying], Go H3212 (8798), ye swift H7031 messengers H4397, to a nation H1471 scattered H4900 (8794) and peeled H4178 (8794), to a people H5971 terrible H3372 (8737) from their beginning hitherto H1973; a nation H1471 meted out H6978 and trodden down H4001, whose land H0776 the rivers H5104 have spoiled H0958 (8804)!
018:003 All ye inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the world H8398, and dwellers H7931 (8802) on the earth H0776, see H7200 (8799) ye, when he lifteth up H5375 (8800) an ensign H5251 on the mountains H2022; and when he bloweth H8628 (8800) a trumpet H7782, hear H8085 (8799) ye.
018:004 For so H3541 the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804) unto me, I will take my rest H8252 (8799), and I will consider H5027 (8686) in my dwelling place H4349 like a clear H6703 heat H2527 upon herbs H0216, [and] like a cloud H5645 of dew H2919 in the heat H2527 of harvest H7105.
018:005 For afore H6440 the harvest H7105, when the bud H6525 is perfect H8552 (8800), and the sour grape H1155 is ripening H1580 (8802) in the flower H5328, he shall both cut off H3772 (8804) the sprigs H2150 with pruning hooks H4211, and take away H5493 (8689) [and] cut down H8456 (8689) the branches H5189.
018:006 They shall be left H5800 (8735) together H3162 unto the fowls H5861 of the mountains H2022, and to the beasts H0929 of the earth H0776: and the fowls H5861 shall summer H6972 (8804) upon them, and all the beasts H0929 of the earth H0776 shall winter H2778 (8799) upon them.
018:007 In that time H6256 shall the present H7862 be brought H2986 (8714) unto the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 of a people H5971 scattered H4900 (8794) and peeled H4178 (8794), and from a people H5971 terrible H3372 (8737) from their beginning hitherto H1973; a nation H1471 meted out H6978 and trodden under foot H4001, whose land H0776 the rivers H5104 have spoiled H0958 (8804), to the place H4725 of the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the mount H2022 Zion H6726.
019:001 ¶  The burden H4853 of Egypt H4714. Behold, the LORD H3068 rideth H7392 (8802) upon a swift H7031 cloud H5645, and shall come H0935 (8804) into Egypt H4714: and the idols H0457 of Egypt H4714 shall be moved H5128 (8804) at his presence H6440, and the heart H3824 of Egypt H4714 shall melt H4549 (8735) in the midst H7130 of it.
019:002 And I will set H5526 (8773) the Egyptians H4714 against the Egyptians H4714: and they shall fight H3898 (8738) every one H0376 against his brother H0251, and every one H0376 against his neighbour H7453; city H5892 against city H5892, [and] kingdom H4467 against kingdom H4467.
019:003 And the spirit H7307 of Egypt H4714 shall fail H1238 (8738) in the midst H7130 thereof; and I will destroy H1104 (8762) the counsel H6098 thereof: and they shall seek H1875 (8804) to the idols H0457, and to the charmers H0328, and to them that have familiar spirits H0178, and to the wizards H3049.
019:004 And H0853 the Egyptians H4714 will I give over H5534 (8765) into the hand H3027 of a cruel H7186 lord H0113; and a fierce H5794 king H4428 shall rule H4910 (8799) over them, saith H5002 (8803) the Lord H0113, the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
019:005 And the waters H4325 shall fail H5405 (8738) from the sea H3220, and the river H5104 shall be wasted H2717 (8799) and dried up H3001 (8804).
019:006 And they shall turn H2186 the rivers H5104 far away H2186 (8689); [and] the brooks H2975 of defence H4693 shall be emptied H1809 (8804) and dried up H2717 (8804): the reeds H7070 and flags H5488 shall wither H7060 (8804).
019:007 The paper reeds H6169 by the brooks H2975, by the mouth H6310 of the brooks H2975, and every thing sown H4218 by the brooks H2975, shall wither H3001 (8799), be driven away H5086 (8738), and be no [more].
019:008 The fishers H1771 also shall mourn H0578 (8804), and all they that cast H7993 (8688) angle H2443 into the brooks H2975 shall lament H0056 (8804), and they that spread H6566 (8802) nets H4365 upon H6440 the waters H4325 shall languish H0535 (8797).
019:009 Moreover they that work H5647 (8802) in fine H8305 flax H6593, and they that weave H0707 (8802) networks H2355, shall be confounded H0954 (8804).
019:010 And they shall be broken H1792 (8794) in the purposes H8356 thereof, all that make H6213 (8802) sluices H7938 [and] ponds H0099 for fish H5315.
019:011 Surely the princes H8269 of Zoan H6814 [are] fools H0191, the counsel H6098 of the wise H2450 counsellors H3289 (8802) of Pharaoh H6547 is become brutish H1197 (8737): how say H0559 (8799) ye unto Pharaoh H6547, I [am] the son H1121 of the wise H2450, the son H1121 of ancient H6924 kings H4428?
019:012 Where H0335 [are] they? where H0645 [are] thy wise H2450 [men]? and let them tell H5046 (8686) thee now, and let them know H3045 (8799) what the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 hath purposed H3289 (8804) upon Egypt H4714.
019:013 The princes H8269 of Zoan H6814 are become fools H2973 (8738), the princes H8269 of Noph H5297 are deceived H5377 (8738); they have also seduced H8582 (8689) Egypt H4714, [even they that are] the stay H6438 of the tribes H7626 thereof.
019:014 The LORD H3068 hath mingled H4537 (8804) a perverse H5773 spirit H7307 in the midst H7130 thereof: and they have caused Egypt H4714 to err H8582 (8689) in every work H4639 thereof, as a drunken H7910 [man] staggereth H8582 (8736) in his vomit H6892.
019:015 Neither shall there be [any] work H4639 for Egypt H4714, which the head H7218 or tail H2180, branch H3712 or rush H0100, may do H6213 (8799).
019:016 In that day H3117 shall Egypt H4714 be like unto women H0802: and it shall be afraid H2729 (8804) and fear H6342 (8804) because H6440 of the shaking H8573 of the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, which he shaketh H5130 (8688) over it.
019:017 And the land H0127 of Judah H3063 shall be a terror H2283 unto Egypt H4714, every one that maketh mention H2142 (8686) thereof shall be afraid H6342 (8799) in himself, because H6440 of the counsel H6098 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, which he hath determined H3289 (8802) against it.
019:018 In that day H3117 shall five H2568 cities H5892 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714 speak H1696 (8764) the language H8193 of Canaan H3667, and swear H7650 (8737) to the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; one H0259 shall be called H0559 (8735), The city H5892 of destruction H2041.
019:019 In that day H3117 shall there be an altar H4196 to the LORD H3068 in the midst H8432 of the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and a pillar H4676 at H0681 the border H1366 thereof to the LORD H3068.
019:020 And it shall be for a sign H0226 and for a witness H5707 unto the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714: for they shall cry H6817 (8799) unto the LORD H3068 because H6440 of the oppressors H3905 (8801), and he shall send H7971 (8799) them a saviour H3467 (8688), and a great one H7227, and he shall deliver H5337 (8689) them.
019:021 And the LORD H3068 shall be known H3045 (8738) to Egypt H4714, and the Egyptians H4714 shall know H3045 (8804) the LORD H3068 in that day H3117, and shall do H5647 (8804) sacrifice H2077 and oblation H4503; yea, they shall vow H5087 (8804) a vow H5088 unto the LORD H3068, and perform H7999 (8765) [it].
019:022 And the LORD H3068 shall smite H5062 (8804) Egypt H4714: he shall smite H5062 (8800) and heal H7495 (8800) [it]: and they shall return H7725 (8804) [even] to the LORD H3068, and he shall be intreated H6279 (8738) of them, and shall heal H7495 (8804) them.
019:023 In that day H3117 shall there be a highway H4546 out of Egypt H4714 to Assyria H0804, and the Assyrian H0804 shall come H0935 (8804) into Egypt H4714, and the Egyptian H4714 into Assyria H0804, and the Egyptians H4714 shall serve H5647 (8804) with the Assyrians H0804.
019:024 In that day H3117 shall Israel H3478 be the third H7992 with Egypt H4714 and with Assyria H0804, [even] a blessing H1293 in the midst H7130 of the land H0776:
019:025 Whom the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 shall bless H1288 (8765), saying H0559 (8800), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] Egypt H4714 my people H5971, and Assyria H0804 the work H4639 of my hands H3027, and Israel H3478 mine inheritance H5159.
020:001 ¶  In the year H8141 that Tartan H8661 came H0935 (8800) unto Ashdod H0795, (when Sargon H5623 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 sent H7971 (8800) him,) and fought H3898 (8735) against Ashdod H0795, and took H3920 (8799) it;
020:002 At the same time H6256 spake H1696 (8765) the LORD H3068 by H3027 Isaiah H3470 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531, saying H0559 (8800), Go H3212 (8798) and loose H6605 (8765) the sackcloth H8242 from off thy loins H4975, and put off H2502 (8799) thy shoe H5275 from thy foot H7272. And he did so H6213 (8799), walking H1980 (8800) naked H6174 and barefoot H3182.
020:003 And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799), Like as my servant H5650 Isaiah H3470 hath walked H1980 (8804) naked H6174 and barefoot H3182 three H7969 years H8141 [for] a sign H0226 and wonder H4159 upon Egypt H4714 and upon Ethiopia H3568;
020:004 So shall the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 lead away H5090 (8799) the Egyptians H4714 prisoners H7628, and the Ethiopians H3568 captives H1546, young H5288 and old H2205, naked H6174 and barefoot H3182, even with [their] buttocks H8357 uncovered H2834 (8803), to the shame H6172 of Egypt H4714.
020:005 And they shall be afraid H2865 (8804) and ashamed H0954 (8804) of Ethiopia H3568 their expectation H4007, and of Egypt H4714 their glory H8597.
020:006 And the inhabitant H3427 (8802) of this isle H0339 shall say H0559 (8804) in that day H3117, Behold, such H3541 [is] our expectation H4007, whither we flee H5127 (8804) for help H5833 to be delivered H5337 (8736) from H6440 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804: and how shall we escape H4422 (8735)?
021:001 ¶  The burden H4853 of the desert H4057 of the sea H3220. As whirlwinds H5492 in the south H5045 pass H2498 (8800) through; [so] it cometh H0935 (8802) from the desert H4057, from a terrible H3372 (8737) land H0776.
021:002 A grievous H7186 vision H2380 is declared H5046 (8717) unto me; the treacherous dealer H0898 (8802) dealeth treacherously H0898 (8802), and the spoiler H7703 (8802) spoileth H7703 (8802). Go up H5927 (8798), O Elam H5867: besiege H6696 (8798), O Media H4074; all the sighing H0585 thereof have I made to cease H7673 (8689).
021:003 Therefore are my loins H4975 filled H4390 (8804) with pain H2479: pangs H6735 have taken hold H0270 (8804) upon me, as the pangs H6735 of a woman that travaileth H3205 (8802): I was bowed down H5753 (8738) at the hearing H8085 (8800) [of it]; I was dismayed H0926 (8738) at the seeing H7200 (8800) [of it].
021:004 My heart H3824 panted H8582 (8804), fearfulness H6427 affrighted H1204 (8765) me: the night H5399 of my pleasure H2837 hath he turned H7760 (8804) into fear H2731 unto me.
021:005 Prepare H6186 (8800) the table H7979, watch H6822 (8800) in the watchtower H6844, eat H0398 (8800), drink H8354 (8800): arise H6965 (8798), ye princes H8269, [and] anoint H4886 (8798) the shield H4043.
021:006 For thus hath the Lord H0136 said H0559 (8804) unto me, Go H3212 (8798), set H5975 (8685) a watchman H6822 (8764), let him declare H5046 (8686) what he seeth H7200 (8799).
021:007 And he saw H7200 (8804) a chariot H7393 [with] a couple H6776 of horsemen H6571, a chariot H7393 of asses H2543, [and] a chariot H7393 of camels H1581; and he hearkened H7181 (8689) diligently H7182 with much H7227 heed H7182:
021:008 And he cried H7121 (8799), A lion H0738: My lord H0136, I stand H5975 (8802) continually H8548 upon the watchtower H4707 in the daytime H3119, and I am set H5324 (8737) in my ward H4931 whole nights H3915:
021:009 And, behold, here cometh H0935 (8802) a chariot H7393 of men H0376, [with] a couple H6776 of horsemen H6571. And he answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799), Babylon H0894 is fallen H5307 (8804), is fallen H5307 (8804); and all the graven images H6456 of her gods H0430 he hath broken H7665 (8765) unto the ground H0776.
021:010 O my threshing H4098, and the corn H1121 of my floor H1637: that which I have heard H8085 (8804) of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, the God H0430 of Israel H3478, have I declared H5046 (8689) unto you.
021:011 The burden H4853 of Dumah H1746. He calleth H7121 (8802) to me out of Seir H8165, Watchman H8104 (8802), what of the night H3915? Watchman H8104 (8802), what of the night H3915?
021:012 The watchman H8104 (8802) said H0559 (8804), The morning H1242 cometh H0857 (8804), and also the night H3915: if ye will enquire H1158 (8799), enquire H1158 (8798) ye: return H7725 (8798), come H0857 (8798).
021:013 The burden H4853 upon Arabia H6152. In the forest H3293 in Arabia H6152 shall ye lodge H3885 (8799), O ye travelling companies H0736 of Dedanim H1720.
021:014 The inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776 of Tema H8485 brought H0857 (8689) water H4325 to him H7125 (8800) that was thirsty H6771, they prevented H6923 (8765) with their bread H3899 him that fled H5074 (8802).
021:015 For they fled H5074 (8804) from H6440 the swords H2719, from H6440 the drawn H5203 (8803) sword H2719, and from H6440 the bent H1869 (8803) bow H7198, and from H6440 the grievousness H3514 of war H4421.
021:016 For thus hath the Lord H0136 said H0559 (8804) unto me, Within a year H8141, according to the years H8141 of an hireling H7916, and all the glory H3519 of Kedar H6938 shall fail H3615 (8804):
021:017 And the residue H7605 of the number H4557 of archers H7198, the mighty men H1368 of the children H1121 of Kedar H6938, shall be diminished H4591 (8799): for the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 hath spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
022:001 ¶  The burden H4853 of the valley H1516 of vision H2384. What aileth thee now H0645, that thou art wholly gone up H5927 (8804) to the housetops H1406?
022:002 Thou that art full H4392 of stirs H8663, a tumultuous H1993 (8802) city H5892, a joyous H5947 city H7151: thy slain H2491 [men are] not slain H2491 with the sword H2719, nor dead H4191 (8801) in battle H4421.
022:003 All thy rulers H7101 are fled H5074 (8804) together H3162, they are bound H0631 (8795) by the archers H7198: all that are found H4672 (8737) in thee are bound H0631 (8795) together H3162, [which] have fled H1272 (8804) from far H7350.
022:004 Therefore said H0559 (8804) I, Look away H8159 (8798) from me; I will weep H1065 bitterly H4843 (8762), labour H0213 (8686) not to comfort H5162 (8763) me, because of the spoiling H7701 of the daughter H1323 of my people H5971.
022:005 For [it is] a day H3117 of trouble H4103, and of treading down H4001, and of perplexity H3998 by the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635 in the valley H1516 of vision H2384, breaking H6979 (8772) down the walls H7023, and of crying H7771 to the mountains H2022.
022:006 And Elam H5867 bare H5375 (8804) the quiver H0827 with chariots H7393 of men H0120 [and] horsemen H6571, and Kir H7024 uncovered H6168 (8765) the shield H4043.
022:007 And it shall come to pass, [that] thy choicest H4005 valleys H6010 shall be full H4390 (8804) of chariots H7393, and the horsemen H6571 shall set H7896 (8804) themselves in array H7896 (8800) at the gate H8179.
022:008 And he discovered H1540 (8762) the covering H4539 of Judah H3063, and thou didst look H5027 (8686) in that day H3117 to the armour H5402 of the house H1004 of the forest H3293.
022:009 Ye have seen H7200 (8804) also the breaches H1233 of the city H5892 of David H1732, that they are many H7231 (8804): and ye gathered together H6908 (8762) the waters H4325 of the lower H8481 pool H1295.
022:010 And ye have numbered H5608 (8804) the houses H1004 of Jerusalem H3389, and the houses H1004 have ye broken down H5422 (8799) to fortify H1219 (8763) the wall H2346.
022:011 Ye made H6213 (8804) also a ditch H4724 between the two walls H2346 for the water H4325 of the old H3465 pool H1295: but ye have not looked H5027 (8689) unto the maker H6213 (8802) thereof, neither had respect H7200 (8804) unto him that fashioned H3335 (8802) it long ago H7350.
022:012 And in that day H3117 did the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635 call H7121 (8799) to weeping H1065, and to mourning H4553, and to baldness H7144, and to girding H2296 (8800) with sackcloth H8242:
022:013 And behold joy H8342 and gladness H8057, slaying H2026 (8800) oxen H1241, and killing H7819 (8800) sheep H6629, eating H0398 (8800) flesh H1320, and drinking H8354 (8800) wine H3196: let us eat H0398 (8800) and drink H8354 (8800); for to morrow H4279 we shall die H4191 (8799).
022:014 And it was revealed H1540 (8738) in mine ears H0241 by the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, Surely this iniquity H5771 shall not be purged H3722 (8792) from you till ye die H4191 (8799), saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635.
022:015 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635, Go H3212 (8798), get H0935 (8798) thee unto this treasurer H5532 (8802), [even] unto Shebna H7644, which [is] over the house H1004, [and say],
022:016 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out H2672 (8804) a sepulchre H6913 here H6311, [as] he that heweth him out H2672 (8802) a sepulchre H6913 on high H4791, [and] that graveth H2710 (8802) an habitation H4908 for himself in a rock H5553?
022:017 Behold, the LORD H3068 will carry thee away H2904 (8772) with a mighty H1397 captivity H2925, and will surely H5844 (8800) cover H5844 (8802) thee.
022:018 He will surely H6801 (8800) violently turn H6801 (8799) and toss H6802 thee [like] a ball H1754 into a large H7342 H3027 country H0776: there shalt thou die H4191 (8799), and there the chariots H4818 of thy glory H3519 [shall be] the shame H7036 of thy lord’s H0113 house H1004.
022:019 And I will drive H1920 (8804) thee from thy station H4673, and from thy state H4612 shall he pull thee down H2040 (8799).
022:020 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, that I will call H7121 (8804) my servant H5650 Eliakim H0471 the son H1121 of Hilkiah H2518:
022:021 And I will clothe H3847 (8689) him with thy robe H3801, and strengthen H2388 (8762) him with thy girdle H0073, and I will commit H5414 (8799) thy government H4475 into his hand H3027: and he shall be a father H0001 to the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jerusalem H3389, and to the house H1004 of Judah H3063.
022:022 And the key H4668 of the house H1004 of David H1732 will I lay H5414 (8804) upon his shoulder H7926; so he shall open H6605 (8804), and none shall shut H5462 (8802); and he shall shut H5462 (8804), and none shall open H6605 (8802).
022:023 And I will fasten H8628 (8804) him [as] a nail H3489 in a sure H0539 (8737) place H4725; and he shall be for a glorious H3519 throne H3678 to his father’s H0001 house H1004.
022:024 And they shall hang H8518 (8804) upon him all the glory H3519 of his father’s H0001 house H1004, the offspring H6631 and the issue H6849, all vessels H3627 of small H6996 quantity, from the vessels H3627 of cups H0101, even to all the vessels H3627 of flagons H5035.
022:025 In that day H3117, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, shall the nail H3489 that is fastened H8628 (8803) in the sure H0539 (8737) place H4725 be removed H4185 (8799), and be cut down H1438 (8738), and fall H5307 (8804); and the burden H4853 that [was] upon it shall be cut off H3772 (8738): for the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
023:001 ¶  The burden H4853 of Tyre H6865. Howl H3213 (8685), ye ships H0591 of Tarshish H8659; for it is laid waste H7703 (8795), so that there is no house H1004, no entering in H0935 (8800): from the land H0776 of Chittim H3794 it is revealed H1540 (8738) to them.
023:002 Be still H1826 (8798), ye inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the isle H0339; thou whom the merchants H5503 (8802) of Zidon H6721, that pass over H5674 (8802) the sea H3220, have replenished H4390 (8765).
023:003 And by great H7227 waters H4325 the seed H2233 of Sihor H7883, the harvest H7105 of the river H2975, [is] her revenue H8393; and she is a mart H5505 of nations H1471.
023:004 Be thou ashamed H0954 (8798), O Zidon H6721: for the sea H3220 hath spoken H0559 (8804), [even] the strength H4581 of the sea H3220, saying H0559 (8800), I travail H2342 (8804) not, nor bring forth children H3205 (8804), neither do I nourish up H1431 (8765) young men H0970, [nor] bring up H7311 (8790) virgins H1330.
023:005 As at the report H8088 concerning Egypt H4714, [so] shall they be sorely pained H2342 (8799) at the report H8088 of Tyre H6865.
023:006 Pass ye over H5674 (8798) to Tarshish H8659; howl H3213 (8685), ye inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the isle H0339.
023:007 [Is] this your joyous H5947 [city], whose antiquity H6927 [is] of ancient H6924 days H3117? her own feet H7272 shall carry H2986 (8686) her afar off H7350 to sojourn H1481 (8800).
023:008 Who hath taken this counsel H3289 (8804) against Tyre H6865, the crowning H5849 (8688) [city], whose merchants H5503 (8802) [are] princes H8269, whose traffickers H3667 [are] the honourable H3513 (8737) of the earth H0776?
023:009 The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 hath purposed H3289 (8804) it, to stain H2490 (8763) the pride H1347 of all glory H6643, [and] to bring into contempt H7043 (8687) all the honourable H3513 (8737) of the earth H0776.
023:010 Pass H5674 (8798) through thy land H0776 as a river H2975, O daughter H1323 of Tarshish H8659: [there is] no more strength H4206.
023:011 He stretched out H5186 (8804) his hand H3027 over the sea H3220, he shook H7264 (8689) the kingdoms H4467: the LORD H3068 hath given a commandment H6680 (8765) against the merchant H3667 [city], to destroy H8045 (8687) the strong H4581 holds H4581 thereof.
023:012 And he said H0559 (8799), Thou shalt no more H3254 (8686) rejoice H5937 (8800), O thou oppressed H6231 (8794) virgin H1330, daughter H1323 of Zidon H6721: arise H6965 (8798), pass over H5674 (8798) to Chittim H3794; there also shalt thou have no rest H5117 (8799).
023:013 Behold the land H0776 of the Chaldeans H3778; this people H5971 was not, [till] the Assyrian H0804 founded H3245 (8804) it for them that dwell in the wilderness H6728: they set up H6965 (8689) the towers H0971 thereof, they raised up H6209 (8782) the palaces H0759 thereof; [and] he brought H7760 (8804) it to ruin H4654.
023:014 Howl H3213 (8685), ye ships H0591 of Tarshish H8659: for your strength H4581 is laid waste H7703 (8795).
023:015 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, that Tyre H6865 shall be forgotten H7911 (8737) seventy H7657 years H8141, according to the days H3117 of one H0259 king H4428: after the end H7093 of seventy H7657 years H8141 shall Tyre H6865 sing H7892 as an harlot H2181 (8802).
023:016 Take H3947 (8798) an harp H3658, go about H5437 (8798) the city H5892, thou harlot H2181 (8802) that hast been forgotten H7911 (8737); make sweet H3190 (8685) melody H5059 (8763), sing many H7235 (8685) songs H7892, that thou mayest be remembered H2142 (8735).
023:017 And it shall come to pass after the end H7093 of seventy H7657 years H8141, that the LORD H3068 will visit H6485 (8799) Tyre H6865, and she shall turn H7725 (8804) to her hire H0868, and shall commit fornication H2181 (8804) with all the kingdoms H4467 of the world H0776 upon the face H6440 of the earth H0127.
023:018 And her merchandise H5504 and her hire H0868 shall be holiness H6944 to the LORD H3068: it shall not be treasured H0686 (8735) nor laid up H2630 (8735); for her merchandise H5504 shall be for them that dwell H3427 (8802) before H6440 the LORD H3068, to eat H0398 (8800) sufficiently H7654, and for durable H6266 clothing H4374.
024:001 ¶  Behold, the LORD H3068 maketh the earth H0776 empty H1238 (8802), and maketh it waste H1110 (8802), and turneth H5753 (8765) it upside down H6440, and scattereth abroad H6327 (8689) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof.
024:002 And it shall be, as with the people H5971, so with the priest H3548; as with the servant H5650, so with his master H0113; as with the maid H8198, so with her mistress H1404; as with the buyer H7069 (8802), so with the seller H4376 (8802); as with the lender H3867 (8688), so with the borrower H3867 (8801); as with the taker of usury H5383 (8802), so H0834 with the giver of usury H5378 (8801) to him.
024:003 The land H0776 shall be utterly H1238 (8736) emptied H1238 (8735), and utterly H0962 (8736) spoiled H0962 (8735): for the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) this word H1697.
024:004 The earth H0776 mourneth H0056 (8804) [and] fadeth away H5034 (8804), the world H8398 languisheth H0535 (8797) [and] fadeth away H5034 (8804), the haughty H4791 people H5971 of the earth H0776 do languish H0535 (8797).
024:005 The earth H0776 also is defiled H2610 (8804) under the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof; because they have transgressed H5674 (8804) the laws H8451, changed H2498 (8804) the ordinance H2706, broken H6565 (8689) the everlasting H5769 covenant H1285.
024:006 Therefore hath the curse H0423 devoured H0398 (8804) the earth H0776, and they that dwell H3427 (8802) therein are desolate H0816 (8799): therefore the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the earth H0776 are burned H2787 (8804), and few H4213 men H0582 left H7604 (8738).
024:007 The new wine H8492 mourneth H0056 (8804), the vine H1612 languisheth H0535 (8797), all the merryhearted H8056 H3820 do sigh H0584 (8738).
024:008 The mirth H4885 of tabrets H8596 ceaseth H7673 (8804), the noise H7588 of them that rejoice H5947 endeth H2308 (8804), the joy H4885 of the harp H3658 ceaseth H7673 (8804).
024:009 They shall not drink H8354 (8799) wine H3196 with a song H7892; strong drink H7941 shall be bitter H4843 (8799) to them that drink H8354 (8802) it.
024:010 The city H7151 of confusion H8414 is broken down H7665 (8738): every house H1004 is shut up H5462 (8795), that no man may come in H0935 (8800).
024:011 [There is] a crying H6682 for wine H3196 in the streets H2351; all joy H8057 is darkened H6150 (8804), the mirth H4885 of the land H0776 is gone H1540 (8804).
024:012 In the city H5892 is left H7604 (8738) desolation H8047, and the gate H8179 is smitten H3807 (8714) with destruction H7591.
024:013 When thus it shall be in the midst H7130 of the land H0776 among H8432 the people H5971, [there shall be] as the shaking H5363 of an olive tree H2132, [and] as the gleaning grapes H5955 when the vintage H1210 is done H3615 (8804).
024:014 They shall lift up H5375 (8799) their voice H6963, they shall sing H7442 (8799) for the majesty H1347 of the LORD H3068, they shall cry aloud H6670 (8804) from the sea H3220.
024:015 Wherefore glorify H3513 (8761) ye the LORD H3068 in the fires H0217, [even] the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 in the isles H0339 of the sea H3220.
024:016 From the uttermost part H3671 of the earth H0776 have we heard H8085 (8804) songs H2158, [even] glory H6643 to the righteous H6662. But I said H0559 (8799), My leanness H7334, my leanness H7334, woe H0188 unto me! the treacherous dealers H0898 (8802) have dealt treacherously H0898 (8804); yea, the treacherous dealers H0898 (8802) have dealt very H0899 treacherously H0898 (8804).
024:017 Fear H6343, and the pit H6354, and the snare H6341, [are] upon thee, O inhabitant H3427 (8802) of the earth H0776.
024:018 And it shall come to pass, [that] he who fleeth H5127 (8801) from the noise H6963 of the fear H6343 shall fall H5307 (8799) into the pit H6354; and he that cometh up H5927 (8802) out of the midst H8432 of the pit H6354 shall be taken H3920 (8735) in the snare H6341: for the windows H0699 from on high H4791 are open H6605 (8738), and the foundations H4146 of the earth H0776 do shake H7493 (8799).
024:019 The earth H0776 is utterly H7489 (8800) broken down H7489 (8712), the earth H0776 is clean H6565 (8800) dissolved H6565 (8707), the earth H0776 is moved H4131 (8694) exceedingly H4131 (8800).
024:020 The earth H0776 shall reel H5128 (8799) to and fro H5128 (8800) like a drunkard H7910, and shall be removed H5110 (8712) like a cottage H4412; and the transgression H6588 thereof shall be heavy H3513 (8804) upon it; and it shall fall H5307 (8804), and not rise H6965 (8800) again H3254 (8686).
024:021 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] the LORD H3068 shall punish H6485 (8799) the host H6635 of the high ones H4791 [that are] on high H4791, and the kings H4428 of the earth H0127 upon the earth H0127.
024:022 And they shall be gathered together H0622 (8795), [as] prisoners H0616 are gathered H0626 in the pit H0953, and shall be shut up H5462 (8795) in the prison H4525, and after many H7230 days H3117 shall they be visited H6485 (8735).
024:023 Then the moon H3842 shall be confounded H2659 (8804), and the sun H2535 ashamed H0954 (8804), when the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 shall reign H4427 (8804) in mount H2022 Zion H6726, and in Jerusalem H3389, and before his ancients H2205 gloriously H3519.
025:001 ¶  O LORD H3068, thou [art] my God H0430; I will exalt H7311 (8787) thee, I will praise H3034 (8686) thy name H8034; for thou hast done H6213 (8804) wonderful H6382 [things; thy] counsels H6098 of old H7350 [are] faithfulness H0530 [and] truth H0544.
025:002 For thou hast made H7760 (8804) of a city H5892 an heap H1530; [of] a defenced H1219 (8803) city H7151 a ruin H4654: a palace H0759 of strangers H2114 (8801) to be no city H5892; it shall never H5769 be built H1129 (8735).
025:003 Therefore shall the strong H5794 people H5971 glorify H3513 (8762) thee, the city H7151 of the terrible H6184 nations H1471 shall fear H3372 (8799) thee.
025:004 For thou hast been a strength H4581 to the poor H1800, a strength H4581 to the needy H0034 in his distress H6862, a refuge H4268 from the storm H2230, a shadow H6738 from the heat H2721, when the blast H7307 of the terrible ones H6184 [is] as a storm H2230 [against] the wall H7023.
025:005 Thou shalt bring down H3665 (8686) the noise H7588 of strangers H2114 (8801), as the heat H2721 in a dry place H6724; [even] the heat H2721 with the shadow H6738 of a cloud H5645: the branch H2159 of the terrible ones H6184 shall be brought low H6030 (8799).
025:006 And in this mountain H2022 shall the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 make H6213 (8804) unto all people H5971 a feast H4960 of fat things H8081, a feast H4960 of wines on the lees H8105, of fat things H8081 full of marrow H4229 (8794), of wines on the lees H8105 well refined H2212 (8794).
025:007 And he will destroy H1104 (8765) in this mountain H2022 the face H6440 of the covering H3875 cast over H3874 (8802) all people H5971, and the vail H4541 that is spread H5259 (8803) over all nations H1471.
025:008 He will swallow up H1104 (8765) death H4194 in victory H5331; and the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 will wipe away H4229 (8804) tears H1832 from off all faces H6440; and the rebuke H2781 of his people H5971 shall he take away H5493 (8686) from off all the earth H0776: for the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
025:009 And it shall be said H0559 (8804) in that day H3117, Lo, this [is] our God H0430; we have waited H6960 (8765) for him, and he will save H3467 (8686) us: this [is] the LORD H3068; we have waited H6960 (8765) for him, we will be glad H1523 (8799) and rejoice H8055 (8799) in his salvation H3444.
025:010 For in this mountain H2022 shall the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 rest H5117 (8799), and Moab H4124 shall be trodden down H1758 (8736) under him, even as straw H4963 is trodden down H1758 (8738) for the dunghill H1119 H4087 (8675) H4325.
025:011 And he shall spread forth H6566 (8765) his hands H3027 in the midst H7130 of them, as he that swimmeth H7811 (8802) spreadeth forth H6566 (8762) [his hands] to swim H7811 (8800): and he shall bring down H8213 (8689) their pride H1346 together with the spoils H0698 of their hands H3027.
025:012 And the fortress H4013 of the high fort H4869 of thy walls H2346 shall he bring down H7817 (8689), lay low H8213 (8689), [and] bring H5060 (8689) to the ground H0776, [even] to the dust H6083.
026:001 ¶  In that day H3117 shall this song H7892 be sung H7891 (8714) in the land H0776 of Judah H3063; We have a strong H5797 city H5892; salvation H3444 will [God] appoint H7896 (8799) [for] walls H2346 and bulwarks H2426.
026:002 Open H6605 (8798) ye the gates H8179, that the righteous H6662 nation H1471 which keepeth H8104 (8802) the truth H0529 may enter in H0935 (8799).
026:003 Thou wilt keep H5341 (8799) [him] in perfect H7965 peace H7965, [whose] mind H3336 [is] stayed H5564 (8803) [on thee]: because he trusteth H0982 (8803) in thee.
026:004 Trust H0982 (8798) ye in the LORD H3068 for ever H5703: for in the LORD H3050 JEHOVAH H3068 [is] everlasting H5769 strength H6697:
026:005 For he bringeth down H7817 (8689) them that dwell H3427 (8802) on high H4791; the lofty H7682 (8737) city H7151, he layeth it low H8213 (8686); he layeth it low H8213 (8686), [even] to the ground H0776; he bringeth H5060 (8686) it [even] to the dust H6083.
026:006 The foot H7272 shall tread it down H7429 (8799), [even] the feet H7272 of the poor H6041, [and] the steps H6471 of the needy H1800.
026:007 The way H0734 of the just H6662 [is] uprightness H4339: thou, most upright H3477, dost weigh H6424 (8762) the path H4570 of the just H6662.
026:008 Yea, in the way H0734 of thy judgments H4941, O LORD H3068, have we waited H6960 (8765) for thee; the desire H8378 of [our] soul H5315 [is] to thy name H8034, and to the remembrance H2143 of thee.
026:009 With my soul H5315 have I desired H0183 (8765) thee in the night H3915; yea, with my spirit H7307 within H7130 me will I seek thee early H7836 (8762): for when thy judgments H4941 [are] in the earth H0776, the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the world H8398 will learn H3925 (8804) righteousness H6664.
026:010 Let favour be shewed H2603 (8717) to the wicked H7563, [yet] will he not H1077 learn H3925 (8804) righteousness H6664: in the land H0776 of uprightness H5229 will he deal unjustly H5765 (8762), and will not H1077 behold H7200 (8799) the majesty H1348 of the LORD H3068.
026:011 LORD H3068, [when] thy hand H3027 is lifted up H7311 (8804), they will not see H2372 (8799): [but] they shall see H2372 (8799), and be ashamed H0954 (8799) for [their] envy H7068 at the people H5971; yea, the fire H0784 of thine enemies H6862 shall devour H0398 (8799) them.
026:012 LORD H3068, thou wilt ordain H8239 (8799) peace H7965 for us: for thou also hast wrought H6466 (8804) all our works H4639 in us.
026:013 O LORD H3068 our God H0430, [other] lords H0113 beside H2108 thee have had dominion H1166 (8804) over us: [but] by thee only will we make mention H2142 (8686) of thy name H8034.
026:014 [They are] dead H4191 (8801), they shall not live H2421 (8799); [they are] deceased H7496, they shall not rise H6965 (8799): therefore hast thou visited H6485 (8804) and destroyed H8045 (8686) them, and made all their memory H2143 to perish H0006 (8762).
026:015 Thou hast increased H3254 (8804) the nation H1471, O LORD H3068, thou hast increased H3254 (8804) the nation H1471: thou art glorified H3513 (8738): thou hadst removed [it] far H7368 (8765) [unto] all the ends H7099 of the earth H0776.
026:016 LORD H3068, in trouble H6862 have they visited H6485 (8804) thee, they poured out H6694 (8804) a prayer H3908 [when] thy chastening H4148 [was] upon them.
026:017 Like H3644 as a woman with child H2030, [that] draweth near H7126 (8686) the time of her delivery H3205 (8800), is in pain H2342 (8799), [and] crieth out H2199 (8799) in her pangs H2256; so have we been in thy sight H6440, O LORD H3068.
026:018 We have been with child H2029 (8804), we have been in pain H2342 (8804), we have as it were H3644 brought forth H3205 (8804) wind H7307; we have not wrought H6213 (8799) any deliverance H3444 in the earth H0776; neither H1077 have the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the world H8398 fallen H5307 (8799).
026:019 Thy dead H4191 (8801) [men] shall live H2421 (8799), [together with] my dead body H5038 shall they arise H6965 (8799). Awake H6974 (8685) and sing H7442 (8761), ye that dwell H7931 (8802) in dust H6083: for thy dew H2919 [is as] the dew H2919 of herbs H0219, and the earth H0776 shall cast out H5307 (8686) the dead H7496.
026:020 Come H3212 (8798), my people H5971, enter H0935 (8798) thou into thy chambers H2315, and shut H5462 (8798) thy doors H1817 about thee: hide H2247 (8798) thyself as it were for a little H4592 moment H7281, until the indignation H2195 be overpast H5674 (8799).
026:021 For, behold, the LORD H3068 cometh out H3318 (8802) of his place H4725 to punish H6485 (8800) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the earth H0776 for their iniquity H5771: the earth H0776 also shall disclose H1540 (8765) her blood H1818, and shall no more cover H3680 (8762) her slain H2026 (8803).
027:001 ¶  In that day H3117 the LORD H3068 with his sore H7186 and great H1419 and strong H2389 sword H2719 shall punish H6485 (8799) leviathan H3882 the piercing H1281 serpent H5175, even leviathan H3882 that crooked H6129 serpent H5175; and he shall slay H2026 (8804) the dragon H8577 that [is] in the sea H3220.
027:002 In that day H3117 sing H6031 (8761) ye unto her, A vineyard H3754 of red wine H2561 (8676) H2531.
027:003 I the LORD H3068 do keep H5341 (8802) it; I will water H8248 (8686) it every moment H7281: lest [any] hurt H6485 (8799) it, I will keep H5341 (8799) it night H3915 and day H3117.
027:004 Fury H2534 [is] not in me: who would set H5414 (8799) the briers H8068 [and] thorns H7898 against me in battle H4421? I would go H6585 (8799) through them, I would burn H6702 (8686) them together H3162.
027:005 Or let him take hold H2388 (8686) of my strength H4581, [that] he may make H6213 (8799) peace H7965 with me; [and] he shall make H6213 (8799) peace H7965 with me.
027:006 He shall cause them that come H0935 (8802) of Jacob H3290 to take root H8327 (8686): Israel H3478 shall blossom H6692 (8686) and bud H6524 (8804), and fill H4390 (8804) the face H6440 of the world H8398 with fruit H8570.
027:007 Hath he smitten H5221 (8689) him, as he smote H4347 those that smote H5221 (8688) him? [or] is he slain H2026 (8795) according to the slaughter H2027 of them that are slain H2026 (8803) by him?
027:008 In measure H5432, when it shooteth forth H7971 (8763), thou wilt debate H7378 (8799) with it: he stayeth H1898 (8804) his rough H7186 wind H7307 in the day H3117 of the east wind H6921.
027:009 By this H2063 therefore shall the iniquity H5771 of Jacob H3290 be purged H3722 (8792); and this [is] all the fruit H6529 to take away H5493 (8687) his sin H2403; when he maketh H7760 (8800) all the stones H0068 of the altar H4196 as chalkstones H1615 that are beaten in sunder H5310 (8794), the groves H0842 and images H2553 shall not stand up H6965 (8799).
027:010 Yet the defenced H1219 (8803) city H5892 [shall be] desolate H0910, [and] the habitation H5116 forsaken H7971 (8794), and left H5800 (8737) like a wilderness H4057: there shall the calf H5695 feed H7462 (8799), and there shall he lie down H7257 (8799), and consume H3615 (8765) the branches H5585 thereof.
027:011 When the boughs H7105 thereof are withered H3001 (8800), they shall be broken off H7665 (8735): the women H0802 come H0935 (8802), [and] set them on fire H0215 (8688): for it [is] a people H5971 of no understanding H0998: therefore he that made H6213 (8802) them will not have mercy H7355 (8762) on them, and he that formed H3335 (8802) them will shew them no favour H2603 (8799).
027:012 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] the LORD H3068 shall beat off H2251 (8799) from the channel H7641 of the river H5104 unto the stream H5158 of Egypt H4714, and ye shall be gathered H3950 (8792) one H0259 by one H0259, O ye children H1121 of Israel H3478.
027:013 And it shall come to pass in that day H3117, [that] the great H1419 trumpet H7782 shall be blown H8628 (8735), and they shall come H0935 (8804) which were ready to perish H0006 (8802) in the land H0776 of Assyria H0804, and the outcasts H5080 (8737) in the land H0776 of Egypt H4714, and shall worship H7812 (8694) the LORD H3068 in the holy H6944 mount H2022 at Jerusalem H3389.
028:001 ¶  Woe H1945 to the crown H5850 of pride H1348, to the drunkards H7910 of Ephraim H0669, whose glorious H6643 beauty H8597 [is] a fading H5034 (8802) flower H6731, which [are] on the head H7218 of the fat H8081 valleys H1516 of them that are overcome H1986 (8803) with wine H3196!
028:002 Behold, the Lord H0136 hath a mighty H2389 and strong one H0533, [which] as a tempest H2230 of hail H1259 [and] a destroying H6986 storm H8178, as a flood H2230 of mighty H3524 waters H4325 overflowing H7857 (8802), shall cast down H3240 (8689) to the earth H0776 with the hand H3027.
028:003 The crown H5850 of pride H1348, the drunkards H7910 of Ephraim H0669, shall be trodden H7429 (8735) under feet H7272:
028:004 And the glorious H6643 beauty H8597, which [is] on the head H7218 of the fat H8081 valley H1516, shall be a fading H5034 (8802) flower H6733, [and] as the hasty fruit H1061 before the summer H7019; which [when] he that looketh H7200 (8802) upon it seeth H7200 (8799), while it is yet in his hand H3709 he eateth it up H1104 (8799).
028:005 In that day H3117 shall the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 be for a crown H5850 of glory H6643, and for a diadem H6843 of beauty H8597, unto the residue H7605 of his people H5971,
028:006 And for a spirit H7307 of judgment H4941 to him that sitteth H3427 (8802) in judgment H4941, and for strength H1369 to them that turn H7725 (8688) the battle H4421 to the gate H8179.
028:007 But they H0428 also have erred H7686 (8804) through wine H3196, and through strong drink H7941 are out of the way H8582 (8804); the priest H3548 and the prophet H5030 have erred H7686 (8804) through strong drink H7941, they are swallowed up H1104 (8738) of H4480 wine H3196, they are out of the way H8582 (8804) through strong drink H7941; they err H7686 (8804) in vision H7203, they stumble H6328 (8804) [in] judgment H6417.
028:008 For all tables H7979 are full H4390 (8804) of vomit H6892 [and] filthiness H6675, [so that there is] no place H4725 [clean].
028:009 Whom shall he teach H3384 (8686) knowledge H1844? and whom shall he make to understand H0995 (8799) doctrine H8052? [them that are] weaned H1580 (8803) from the milk H2461, [and] drawn H6267 from the breasts H7699.
028:010 For precept H6673 [must be] upon precept H6673, precept H6673 upon precept H6673; line H6957 upon line H6957, line H6957 upon line H6957; here a little H2191, [and] there a little H2191:
028:011 For with stammering H3934 lips H8193 and another H0312 tongue H3956 will he speak H1696 (8762) to this people H5971.
028:012 To whom he said H0559 (8804), This [is] the rest H4496 [wherewith] ye may cause the weary H5889 to rest H5117 (8685); and this [is] the refreshing H4774: yet they would H0014 (8804) not hear H8085 (8800).
028:013 But the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 was unto them precept H6673 upon precept H6673, precept H6673 upon precept H6673; line H6957 upon line H6957, line H6957 upon line H6957; here a little H2191, [and] there a little H2191; that they might go H3212 (8799), and fall H3782 (8804) backward H0268, and be broken H7665 (8738), and snared H3369 (8738), and taken H3920 (8738).
028:014 Wherefore hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, ye scornful H3944 men H0582, that rule H4910 (8802) this people H5971 which [is] in Jerusalem H3389.
028:015 Because ye have said H0559 (8804), We have made H3772 (8804) a covenant H1285 with death H4194, and with hell H7585 are we H6213 (8804) at agreement H2374; when the overflowing H7857 (8802) scourge H7752 (8675) H7885 shall pass through H5674 (8799) (8675) H5674 (8804), it shall not come H0935 (8799) unto us: for we have made H7760 (8804) lies H3577 our refuge H4268, and under falsehood H8267 have we hid H5641 (8738) ourselves:
028:016 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, Behold, I lay H3245 (8765) in Zion H6726 for a foundation a stone H0068, a tried H0976 stone H0068, a precious H3368 corner H6438 [stone], a sure H3245 (8716) foundation H4143: he that believeth H0539 (8688) shall not make haste H2363 (8686).
028:017 Judgment H4941 also will I lay H7760 (8804) to the line H6957, and righteousness H6666 to the plummet H4949: and the hail H1259 shall sweep away H3261 (8804) the refuge H4268 of lies H3577, and the waters H4325 shall overflow H7857 (8799) the hiding place H5643.
028:018 And your covenant H1285 with death H4194 shall be disannulled H3722 (8795), and your agreement H2380 with hell H7585 shall not stand H6965 (8799); when the overflowing H7857 (8802) scourge H7752 shall pass through H5674 (8799), then ye shall be trodden down H4823 by it.
028:019 From the time H1767 that it goeth forth H5674 (8800) it shall take H3947 (8799) you: for morning H1242 by morning H1242 shall it pass over H5674 (8799), by day H3117 and by night H3915: and it shall be a vexation H2113 only [to] understand H0995 (8687) the report H8052.
028:020 For the bed H4702 is shorter H7114 (8804) than that [a man] can stretch H8311 (8692) himself [on it]: and the covering H4541 narrower H6887 (8804) than that he can wrap H3664 (8692) himself [in it].
028:021 For the LORD H3068 shall rise up H6965 (8799) as [in] mount H2022 Perazim H6559, he shall be wroth H7264 (8799) as [in] the valley H6010 of Gibeon H1391, that he may do H6213 (8800) his work H4639, his strange H2114 (8801) work H4639; and bring to pass H5647 (8800) his act H5656, his strange H5237 act H5656.
028:022 Now therefore be ye not mockers H3887 (8698), lest your bands H4147 be made strong H2388 (8799): for I have heard H8085 (8804) from the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 of hosts H6635 a consumption H3617, even determined H2782 (8737) upon the whole earth H0776.
028:023 Give ye ear H0238 (8685), and hear H8085 (8798) my voice H6963; hearken H7181 (8685), and hear H8085 (8798) my speech H0565.
028:024 Doth the plowman H2790 (8802) plow H2790 (8799) all day H3117 to sow H2232 (8800)? doth he open H6605 (8762) and break the clods H7702 (8762) of his ground H0127?
028:025 When he hath made plain H7737 (8765) the face H6440 thereof, doth he not cast abroad H6327 (8689) the fitches H7100, and scatter H2236 (8799) the cummin H3646, and cast H7760 (8804) in the principal H7795 wheat H2406 and the appointed H5567 (8737) barley H8184 and the rie H3698 in their place H1367?
028:026 For his God H0430 doth instruct H3256 (8765) him to discretion H4941, [and] doth teach H3384 (8686) him.
028:027 For the fitches H7100 are not threshed H1758 (8714) with a threshing instrument H2742, neither is a cart H5699 wheel H0212 turned about H5437 (8714) upon the cummin H3646; but the fitches H7100 are beaten out H2251 (8735) with a staff H4294, and the cummin H3646 with a rod H7626.
028:028 Bread H3899 [corn] is bruised H1854 (8714); because he will not ever H5331 be threshing H0156 (8800) H1758 (8799) it, nor break H2000 (8804) [it with] the wheel H1536 of his cart H5699, nor bruise H1854 (8799) it [with] his horsemen H6571.
028:029 This also cometh forth H3318 (8804) from the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, [which] is wonderful H6381 (8689) in counsel H6098, [and] excellent H1431 (8689) in working H8454.
029:001 ¶  Woe H1945 to Ariel H0740, to Ariel H0740, the city H7151 [where] David H1732 dwelt H2583 (8804)! add H5595 (8798) ye year H8141 to year H8141; let them kill H5362 (8799) sacrifices H2282.
029:002 Yet I will distress H6693 (8689) Ariel H0740, and there shall be heaviness H8386 and sorrow H0592: and it shall be unto me as Ariel H0740.
029:003 And I will camp H2583 (8804) against thee round about H1754, and will lay siege H6696 (8804) against thee with a mount H4674, and I will raise H6965 (8689) forts H4694 against thee.
029:004 And thou shalt be brought down H8213 (8804), [and] shalt speak H1696 (8762) out of the ground H0776, and thy speech H0565 shall be low H7817 (8735) out of the dust H6083, and thy voice H6963 shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit H0178, out of the ground H0776, and thy speech H0565 shall whisper H6850 (8770) out of the dust H6083.
029:005 Moreover the multitude H1995 of thy strangers H2114 (8801) shall be like small H1851 dust H0080, and the multitude H1995 of the terrible ones H6184 [shall be] as chaff H4671 that passeth away H5674 (8802): yea, it shall be at an instant H6621 suddenly H6597.
029:006 Thou shalt be visited H6485 (8735) of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 with thunder H7482, and with earthquake H7494, and great H1419 noise H6963, with storm H5492 and tempest H5591, and the flame H3851 of devouring H0398 (8802) fire H0784.
029:007 And the multitude H1995 of all the nations H1471 that fight H6633 (8802) against Ariel H0740, even all that fight H6638 (8802) against her and her munition H4685, and that distress H6693 (8688) her, shall be as a dream H2472 of a night H3915 vision H2377.
029:008 It shall even be as when an hungry H7457 [man] dreameth H2492 (8799), and, behold, he eateth H0398 (8802); but he awaketh H6974 (8689), and his soul H5315 is empty H7386: or as when H0834 a thirsty man H6771 dreameth H2492 (8799), and, behold, he drinketh H8354 (8802); but he awaketh H6974 (8689), and, behold, [he is] faint H5889, and his soul H5315 hath appetite H8264 (8802): so shall the multitude H1995 of all the nations H1471 be, that fight H6633 (8802) against mount H2022 Zion H6726.
029:009 Stay H4102 (8697) yourselves, and wonder H8539 (8798); cry ye out H8173 (8697), and cry H8173 (8798): they are drunken H7937 (8804), but not with wine H3196; they stagger H5128 (8804), but not with strong drink H7941.
029:010 For the LORD H3068 hath poured out H5258 (8804) upon you the spirit H7307 of deep sleep H8639, and hath closed H6105 (8762) your eyes H5869: the prophets H5030 and your rulers H7218, the seers H2374 hath he covered H3680 (8765).
029:011 And the vision H2380 of all is become unto you as the words H1697 of a book H5612 that is sealed H2856 (8803), which [men] deliver H5414 (8799) to one that is learned H3045 (8802), saying H0559 (8800), Read H7121 (8798) this, I pray thee: and he saith H0559 (8804), I cannot H3201 (8799); for it [is] sealed H2856 (8803):
029:012 And the book H5612 is delivered H5414 (8738) to him that is not learned H3045 (8804) H5612, saying H0559 (8800), Read H7121 (8798) this, I pray thee: and he saith H0559 (8804), I am not learned H3045 (8804).
029:013 Wherefore the Lord H0136 said H0559 (8799), Forasmuch H3282 as this people H5971 draw near H5066 (8738) [me] with their mouth H6310, and with their lips H8193 do honour H3513 (8765) me, but have removed H7368 their heart H3820 far H7368 (8765) from me, and their fear H3374 toward me is taught H3925 (8794) by the precept H4687 of men H0582:
029:014 Therefore, behold, I will proceed H3254 (8802) to do a marvellous work H6381 (8687) among this people H5971, [even] a marvellous work H6381 (8687) and a wonder H6382: for the wisdom H2451 of their wise H2450 [men] shall perish H0006 (8804), and the understanding H0998 of their prudent H0995 (8737) [men] shall be hid H5641 (8691).
029:015 Woe H1945 unto them that seek deep H6009 (8688) to hide H5641 (8687) their counsel H6098 from the LORD H3068, and their works H4639 are in the dark H4285, and they say H0559 (8799), Who seeth H7200 (8802) us? and who knoweth H3045 (8802) us?
029:016 Surely your turning of things upside down H2017 (8800) shall be esteemed H2803 (8735) as the potter’s H3335 (8802) clay H2563: for shall the work H4639 say H0559 (8799) of him that made H6213 (8802) it, He made H6213 (8804) me not? or shall the thing framed H3336 say H0559 (8804) of him that framed H3335 (8802) it, He had no understanding H0995 (8689)?
029:017 [Is] it not yet a very H4213 little while H4592, and Lebanon H3844 shall be turned H7725 (8804) into a fruitful field H3759, and the fruitful field H3759 shall be esteemed H2803 (8735) as a forest H3293?
029:018 And in that day H3117 shall the deaf H2795 hear H8085 (8804) the words H1697 of the book H5612, and the eyes H5869 of the blind H5787 shall see H7200 (8799) out of obscurity H0652, and out of darkness H2822.
029:019 The meek H6035 also shall increase H3254 (8804) [their] joy H8057 in the LORD H3068, and the poor H0034 among men H0120 shall rejoice H1523 (8799) in the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
029:020 For the terrible one H6184 is brought to nought H0656 (8804), and the scorner H3887 (8801) is consumed H3615 (8804), and all that watch H8245 (8802) for iniquity H0205 are cut off H3772 (8738):
029:021 That make a man H0120 an offender H2398 (8688) for a word H1697, and lay a snare H6983 (8799) for him that reproveth H3198 (8688) in the gate H8179, and turn aside H5186 (8686) the just H6662 for a thing of nought H8414.
029:022 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, who redeemed H6299 (8804) Abraham H0085, concerning the house H1004 of Jacob H3290, Jacob H3290 shall not now be ashamed H0954 (8799), neither shall his face H6440 now wax pale H2357 (8799).
029:023 But when he seeth H7200 (8800) his children H3206, the work H4639 of mine hands H3027, in the midst H7130 of him, they shall sanctify H6942 (8686) my name H8034, and sanctify H6942 (8689) the Holy One H6918 of Jacob H3290, and shall fear H6206 (8686) the God H0430 of Israel H3478.
029:024 They also that erred H8582 (8802) in spirit H7307 shall come H3045 (8804) to understanding H0998, and they that murmured H7279 (8803) shall learn H3925 (8799) doctrine H3948.
030:001 ¶  Woe H1945 to the rebellious H5637 (8802) children H1121, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that take H6213 (8800) counsel H6098, but not of me; and that cover H5258 (8800) with a covering H4541, but not of my spirit H7307, that they may add H5595 (8800) sin H2403 to sin H2403:
030:002 That walk H1980 (8802) to go down H3381 (8800) into Egypt H4714, and have not asked H7592 (8804) at my mouth H6310; to strengthen H5810 (8800) themselves in the strength H4581 of Pharaoh H6547, and to trust H2620 (8800) in the shadow H6738 of Egypt H4714!
030:003 Therefore shall the strength H4581 of Pharaoh H6547 be your shame H1322, and the trust H2622 in the shadow H6738 of Egypt H4714 [your] confusion H3639.
030:004 For his princes H8269 were at Zoan H6814, and his ambassadors H4397 came H5060 (8686) to Hanes H2609.
030:005 They were all ashamed H3001 (8689) of a people H5971 [that] could not profit H3276 (8686) them, nor be an help H5828 nor profit H3276 (8687), but a shame H1322, and also a reproach H2781.
030:006 The burden H4853 of the beasts H0929 of the south H5045: into the land H0776 of trouble H6869 and anguish H6695, from whence [come] the young H3833 and old lion H3918, the viper H0660 and fiery H8314 flying H5774 (8789) serpent H8314, they will carry H5375 (8799) their riches H2428 upon the shoulders H3802 of young asses H5895, and their treasures H0214 upon the bunches H1707 of camels H1581, to a people H5971 [that] shall not profit H3276 (8686) [them].
030:007 For the Egyptians H4714 shall help H5826 (8799) in vain H1892, and to no purpose H7385: therefore have I cried H7121 (8804) concerning this H2063, Their H1992 strength H7293 [is] to sit still H7674.
030:008 Now go H0935 (8798), write H3789 (8798) it before them in a table H3871, and note H2710 (8798) it in a book H5612, that it may be for the time H3117 to come H0314 for H5704 ever H5703 and ever H5769:
030:009 That this [is] a rebellious H4805 people H5971, lying H3586 children H1121, children H1121 [that] will H0014 (8804) not hear H8085 (8800) the law H8451 of the LORD H3068:
030:010 Which say H0559 (8804) to the seers H7200 (8802), See H7200 (8799) not; and to the prophets H2374, Prophesy H2372 (8799) not unto us right things H5229, speak H1696 (8761) unto us smooth things H2513, prophesy H2372 (8798) deceits H4123:
030:011 Get you out H5493 (8798) of the way H1870, turn aside H5186 (8685) out of the path H0734, cause the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478 to cease H7673 (8685) from before H6440 us.
030:012 Wherefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478, Because ye despise H3988 (8800) this word H1697, and trust H0982 (8799) in oppression H6233 and perverseness H3868 (8737), and stay H8172 (8735) thereon:
030:013 Therefore this iniquity H5771 shall be to you as a breach H6556 ready to fall H5307 (8802), swelling out H1158 (8737) in a high H7682 (8737) wall H2346, whose breaking H7667 cometh H0935 (8799) suddenly H6597 at an instant H6621.
030:014 And he shall break H7665 (8804) it as the breaking H7667 of the potters H3335 (8802) ’ vessel H5035 that is broken in pieces H3807 (8800); he shall not spare H2550 (8799): so that there shall not be found H4672 (8735) in the bursting H4386 of it a sherd H2789 to take H2846 (8800) fire H0784 from the hearth H3344 (8803), or to take H2834 (8800) water H4325 [withal] out of the pit H1360.
030:015 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478; In returning H7729 and rest H5183 shall ye be saved H3467 (8735); in quietness H8252 (8687) and in confidence H0985 shall be your strength H1369: and ye would H0014 (8804) not.
030:016 But ye said H0559 (8799), No; for we will flee H5127 (8799) upon horses H5483; therefore shall ye flee H5127 (8799): and, We will ride H7392 (8799) upon the swift H7031; therefore shall they that pursue H7291 (8802) you be swift H7043 (8735).
030:017 One H0259 thousand H0505 [shall flee] at H6440 the rebuke H1606 of one H0259; at H6440 the rebuke H1606 of five H2568 shall ye flee H5127 (8799): till ye be left H3498 (8738) as a beacon H8650 upon the top H7218 of a mountain H2022, and as an ensign H5251 on an hill H1389.
030:018 And therefore will the LORD H3068 wait H2442 (8762), that he may be gracious H2603 (8800) unto you, and therefore will he be exalted H7311 (8799), that he may have mercy H7355 (8763) upon you: for the LORD H3068 [is] a God H0430 of judgment H4941: blessed H0835 [are] all they that wait H2442 (8802) for him.
030:019 For the people H5971 shall dwell H3427 (8799) in Zion H6726 at Jerusalem H3389: thou shalt weep H1058 (8799) no more H1058 (8800): he will be very H2603 (8800) gracious H2603 (8799) unto thee at the voice H6963 of thy cry H2199 (8800); when he shall hear H8085 (8800) it, he will answer H6030 (8804) thee.
030:020 And [though] the Lord H0136 give H5414 (8804) you the bread H3899 of adversity H6862, and the water H4325 of affliction H3906, yet shall not thy teachers H3384 (8688) be removed into a corner H3670 (8735) any more, but thine eyes H5869 shall see H7200 (8802) thy teachers H3384 (8688):
030:021 And thine ears H0241 shall hear H8085 (8799) a word H1697 behind H0310 thee, saying H0559 (8800), This [is] the way H1870, walk ye in it H3212 (8798), when ye turn to the right hand H0541 (8686), and when ye turn to the left H8041 (8686).
030:022 Ye shall defile H2930 (8765) also the covering H6826 of thy graven images H6456 of silver H3701, and the ornament H0642 of thy molten images H4541 of gold H2091: thou shalt cast them away H2219 (8799) as a menstruous cloth H1739; thou shalt say H0559 (8799) unto it, Get thee hence H3318 (8798).
030:023 Then shall he give H5414 (8804) the rain H4306 of thy seed H2233, that thou shalt sow H2232 (8799) the ground H0127 withal; and bread H3899 of the increase H8393 of the earth H0127, and it shall be fat H1879 and plenteous H8082: in that day H3117 shall thy cattle H4735 feed H7462 (8799) in large H7337 (8737) pastures H3733.
030:024 The oxen H0504 likewise and the young asses H5895 that ear H5647 (8802) the ground H0127 shall eat H0398 (8799) clean H2548 provender H1098, which hath been winnowed H2219 (8802) with the shovel H7371 and with the fan H4214.
030:025 And there shall be upon every high H1364 mountain H2022, and upon every high H5375 (8737) hill H1389, rivers H6388 [and] streams H2988 of waters H4325 in the day H3117 of the great H7227 slaughter H2027, when the towers H4026 fall H5307 (8800).
030:026 Moreover the light H0216 of the moon H3842 shall be as the light H0216 of the sun H2535, and the light H0216 of the sun H2535 shall be sevenfold H7659, as the light H0216 of seven H7651 days H3117, in the day H3117 that the LORD H3068 bindeth up H2280 (8800) the breach H7667 of his people H5971, and healeth H7495 (8799) the stroke H4273 of their wound H4347.
030:027 Behold, the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 cometh H0935 (8804) from far H4801, burning H1197 (8802) [with] his anger H0639, and the burden H4858 [thereof is] heavy H3514: his lips H8193 are full H4390 (8804) of indignation H2195, and his tongue H3956 as a devouring H0398 (8802) fire H0784:
030:028 And his breath H7307, as an overflowing H7857 (8802) stream H5158, shall reach to the midst H2673 (8799) of the neck H6677, to sift H5130 (8687) the nations H1471 with the sieve H5299 of vanity H7723: and [there shall be] a bridle H7448 in the jaws H3895 of the people H5971, causing [them] to err H8582 (8688).
030:029 Ye shall have a song H7892, as in the night H3915 [when] a holy H6942 solemnity H2282 is kept H6942 (8692); and gladness H8057 of heart H3824, as when one goeth H1980 (8802) with a pipe H2485 to come H0935 (8800) into the mountain H2022 of the LORD H3068, to the mighty One H6697 of Israel H3478.
030:030 And the LORD H3068 shall cause his glorious H1935 voice H6963 to be heard H8085 (8689), and shall shew H7200 (8686) the lighting down H5183 of his arm H2220, with the indignation H2197 of [his] anger H0639, and [with] the flame H3851 of a devouring H0398 (8802) fire H0784, [with] scattering H5311, and tempest H2230, and hailstones H0068 H1259.
030:031 For through the voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 shall the Assyrian H0804 be beaten down H2865 (8735), [which] smote H5221 (8686) with a rod H7626.
030:032 And [in] every place H3605 where the grounded H4145 staff H4294 shall pass H4569, which the LORD H3068 shall lay H5117 (8686) upon him, [it] shall be with tabrets H8596 and harps H3658: and in battles H4421 of shaking H8573 will he fight H3898 (8738) with it.
030:033 For Tophet H8613 [is] ordained H6186 (8803) of old H0865; yea, for the king H4428 it is prepared H3559 (8717); he hath made [it] deep H6009 (8689) [and] large H7337 (8689): the pile H4071 thereof [is] fire H0784 and much H7235 (8687) wood H6086; the breath H5397 of the LORD H3068, like a stream H5158 of brimstone H1614, doth kindle H1197 (8802) it.
031:001 ¶  Woe H1945 to them that go down H3381 (8802) to Egypt H4714 for help H5833; and stay H8172 (8735) on horses H5483, and trust H0982 (8799) in chariots H7393, because [they are] many H7227; and in horsemen H6571, because they are very H3966 strong H6105 (8804); but they look H8159 (8804) not unto the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478, neither seek H1875 (8804) the LORD H3068!
031:002 Yet he also [is] wise H2450, and will bring H0935 (8686) evil H7451, and will not call back H5493 (8689) his words H1697: but will arise H6965 (8804) against the house H1004 of the evildoers H7489 (8688), and against the help H5833 of them that work H6466 (8802) iniquity H0205.
031:003 Now the Egyptians H4714 [are] men H0120, and not God H0410; and their horses H5483 flesh H1320, and not spirit H7307. When the LORD H3068 shall stretch out H5186 (8686) his hand H3027, both he that helpeth H5826 (8802) shall fall H3782 (8804), and he that is holpen H5826 (8803) shall fall down H5307 (8804), and they all shall fail H3615 (8799) together H3162.
031:004 For thus hath the LORD H3068 spoken H0559 (8804) unto me, Like as the lion H0738 and the young lion H3715 roaring H1897 (8799) on his prey H2964, when a multitude H4393 of shepherds H7462 (8802) is called forth H7121 (8735) against him, [he] will not be afraid H2865 (8735) of their voice H6963, nor abase H6031 (8799) himself for the noise H1995 of them: so shall the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 come down H3381 (8799) to fight H6633 (8800) for mount H2022 Zion H6726, and for the hill H1389 thereof.
031:005 As birds H6833 flying H5774 (8802), so will the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 defend H1598 (8686) Jerusalem H3389; defending H1598 (8800) also he will deliver H5337 (8689) [it; and] passing over H6452 (8800) he will preserve H4422 (8689) it.
031:006 Turn H7725 (8798) ye unto [him from] whom the children H1121 of Israel H3478 have deeply H6009 (8689) revolted H5627.
031:007 For in that day H3117 every man H0376 shall cast away H3988 (8799) his idols H0457 of silver H3701, and his idols H0457 of gold H2091, which your own hands H3027 have made H6213 (8804) unto you [for] a sin H2399.
031:008 Then shall the Assyrian H0804 fall H5307 (8804) with the sword H2719, not of a mighty man H0376; and the sword H2719, not of a mean man H0120, shall devour H0398 (8799) him: but he shall flee H5127 (8804) from H6440 the sword H2719, and his young men H0970 shall be discomfited H4522.
031:009 And he shall pass over H5674 (8799) to his strong hold H5553 for fear H4032, and his princes H8269 shall be afraid H2865 (8804) of the ensign H5251, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, whose fire H0217 [is] in Zion H6726, and his furnace H8574 in Jerusalem H3389.
032:001 ¶  Behold, a king H4428 shall reign H4427 (8799) in righteousness H6664, and princes H8269 shall rule H8323 (8799) in judgment H4941.
032:002 And a man H0376 shall be as an hiding place H4224 from the wind H7307, and a covert H5643 from the tempest H2230; as rivers H6388 of water H4325 in a dry place H6724, as the shadow H6738 of a great H3515 rock H5553 in a weary H5889 land H0776.
032:003 And the eyes H5869 of them that see H7200 (8802) shall not be dim H8159 (8799), and the ears H0241 of them that hear H8085 (8802) shall hearken H7181 (8799).
032:004 The heart H3824 also of the rash H4116 (8737) shall understand H0995 (8799) knowledge H1847, and the tongue H3956 of the stammerers H5926 shall be ready H4116 (8762) to speak H1696 (8763) plainly H6703.
032:005 The vile person H5036 shall be no more called H7121 (8735) liberal H5081, nor the churl H3596 said H0559 (8735) [to be] bountiful H7771.
032:006 For the vile person H5036 will speak H1696 (8762) villany H5039, and his heart H3820 will work H6213 (8799) iniquity H0205, to practise H6213 (8800) hypocrisy H2612, and to utter H1696 (8763) error H8442 against the LORD H3068, to make empty H7324 (8687) the soul H5315 of the hungry H7457, and he will cause the drink H4945 of the thirsty H6771 to fail H2637 (8686).
032:007 The instruments H3627 also of the churl H3596 [are] evil H7451: he deviseth H3289 (8804) wicked devices H2154 to destroy H2254 (8763) the poor H6041 (8675) H6035 with lying H8267 words H0561, even when the needy H0034 speaketh H1696 (8763) right H4941.
032:008 But the liberal H5081 deviseth H3289 (8804) liberal things H5081; and by liberal things H5081 shall he stand H6965 (8799).
032:009 Rise up H6965 (8798), ye women H0802 that are at ease H7600; hear H8085 (8798) my voice H6963, ye careless H0982 (8802) daughters H1323; give ear H0238 (8685) unto my speech H0565.
032:010 Many days H3117 and years H8141 shall ye be troubled H7264 (8799), ye careless women H0982 (8802): for the vintage H1210 shall fail H3615 (8804), the gathering H0625 shall not come H0935 (8799).
032:011 Tremble H2729 (8798), ye women that are at ease H7600; be troubled H7264 (8798), ye careless ones H0982 (8802): strip H6584 (8800) you, and make you bare H6209 (8798), and gird H2290 [sackcloth] upon [your] loins H2504.
032:012 They shall lament H5594 (8802) for the teats H7699, for the pleasant H2531 fields H7704, for the fruitful H6509 (8802) vine H1612.
032:013 Upon the land H0127 of my people H5971 shall come up H5927 (8799) thorns H6975 [and] briers H8068; yea, upon all the houses H1004 of joy H4885 [in] the joyous H5947 city H7151:
032:014 Because the palaces H0759 shall be forsaken H5203 (8795); the multitude H1995 of the city H5892 shall be left H5800 (8795); the forts H6076 and towers H0975 shall be for dens H4631 for H5704 ever H5769, a joy H4885 of wild asses H6501, a pasture H4829 of flocks H5739;
032:015 Until the spirit H7307 be poured H6168 (8735) upon us from on high H4791, and the wilderness H4057 be a fruitful field H3759, and the fruitful field H3759 be counted H2803 (8735) for a forest H3293.
032:016 Then judgment H4941 shall dwell H7931 (8804) in the wilderness H4057, and righteousness H6666 remain H3427 (8799) in the fruitful field H3759.
032:017 And the work H4639 of righteousness H6666 shall be peace H7965; and the effect H5656 of righteousness H6666 quietness H8252 (8687) and assurance H0983 for H5704 ever H5769.
032:018 And my people H5971 shall dwell H3427 (8804) in a peaceable H7965 habitation H5116, and in sure H4009 dwellings H4908, and in quiet H7600 resting places H4496;
032:019 When it shall hail H1258 (8804), coming down H3381 (8800) on the forest H3293; and the city H5892 shall be low H8213 (8799) in a low place H8218.
032:020 Blessed H0835 [are] ye that sow H2232 (8802) beside all waters H4325, that send forth H7971 (8764) [thither] the feet H7272 of the ox H7794 and the ass H2543.
033:001 ¶  Woe H1945 to thee that spoilest H7703 (8802), and thou [wast] not spoiled H7703 (8803); and dealest treacherously H0898 (8802), and they dealt not treacherously H0898 (8804) with thee! when thou shalt cease H8552 (8687) to spoil H7703 (8802), thou shalt be spoiled H7703 (8714); [and] when thou shalt make an end H5239 (8687) to deal treacherously H0898 (8800), they shall deal treacherously H0898 (8799) with thee.
033:002 O LORD H3068, be gracious H2603 (8798) unto us; we have waited H6960 (8765) for thee: be thou their arm H2220 every morning H1242, our salvation H3444 also in the time H6256 of trouble H6869.
033:003 At the noise H6963 of the tumult H1995 the people H5971 fled H5074 (8804); at the lifting up H7427 of thyself the nations H1471 were scattered H5310 (8804).
033:004 And your spoil H7998 shall be gathered H0622 (8795) [like] the gathering H0625 of the caterpiller H2625: as the running to and fro H4944 of locusts H1357 shall he run H8264 (8802) upon them.
033:005 The LORD H3068 is exalted H7682 (8737); for he dwelleth H7931 (8802) on high H4791: he hath filled H4390 (8765) Zion H6726 with judgment H4941 and righteousness H6666.
033:006 And wisdom H2451 and knowledge H1847 shall be the stability H0530 of thy times H6256, [and] strength H2633 of salvation H3444: the fear H3374 of the LORD H3068 [is] his treasure H0214.
033:007 Behold, their valiant ones H0691 shall cry H6817 (8804) without H2351: the ambassadors H4397 of peace H7965 shall weep H1058 (8799) bitterly H4751.
033:008 The highways H4546 lie waste H8074 (8738), the wayfaring man H5674 (8802) H0734 ceaseth H7673 (8804): he hath broken H6565 (8689) the covenant H1285, he hath despised H3988 (8804) the cities H5892, he regardeth H2803 (8804) no man H0582.
033:009 The earth H0776 mourneth H0056 (8804) [and] languisheth H0535 (8797): Lebanon H3844 is ashamed H2659 (8689) [and] hewn down H7060 (8804): Sharon H8289 is like a wilderness H6160; and Bashan H1316 and Carmel H3760 shake off H5287 (8802) [their fruits].
033:010 Now will I rise H6965 (8799), saith H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068; now will I be exalted H7426 (8735); now will I lift up H5375 (8735) myself.
033:011 Ye shall conceive H2029 (8799) chaff H2842, ye shall bring forth H3205 (8799) stubble H7179: your breath H7307, [as] fire H0784, shall devour H0398 (8799) you.
033:012 And the people H5971 shall be [as] the burnings H4955 of lime H7875: [as] thorns H6975 cut up H3683 (8803) shall they be burned H3341 (8799) in the fire H0784.
033:013 Hear H8085 (8798), ye [that are] far off H7350, what I have done H6213 (8804); and, ye [that are] near H7138, acknowledge H3045 (8798) my might H1369.
033:014 The sinners H2400 in Zion H6726 are afraid H6342 (8804); fearfulness H7461 hath surprised H0270 (8804) the hypocrites H2611. Who among us shall dwell H1481 (8799) with the devouring H0398 (8802) fire H0784? who among us shall dwell H1481 (8799) with everlasting H5769 burnings H4168?
033:015 He that walketh H1980 (8802) righteously H6666, and speaketh H1696 (8802) uprightly H4339; he that despiseth H3988 (8802) the gain H1215 of oppressions H4642, that shaketh H5287 (8802) his hands H3709 from holding H8551 (8800) of bribes H7810, that stoppeth H0331 (8801) his ears H0241 from hearing H8085 (8800) of blood H1818, and shutteth H6105 (8802) his eyes H5869 from seeing H7200 (8800) evil H7451;
033:016 He shall dwell H7931 (8799) on high H4791: his place of defence H4869 [shall be] the munitions H4679 of rocks H5553: bread H3899 shall be given H5414 (8737) him; his waters H4325 [shall be] sure H0539 (8737).
033:017 Thine eyes H5869 shall see H2372 (8799) the king H4428 in his beauty H3308: they shall behold H7200 (8799) the land H0776 that is very far off H4801.
033:018 Thine heart H3820 shall meditate H1897 (8799) terror H0367. Where [is] the scribe H5608 (8802)? where [is] the receiver H8254 (8802)? where [is] he that counted H5608 (8802) the towers H4026?
033:019 Thou shalt not see H7200 (8799) a fierce H3267 (8737) people H5971, a people H5971 of a deeper H6012 speech H8193 than thou canst perceive H8085 (8800); of a stammering H3932 (8737) tongue H3956, [that thou canst] not understand H0998.
033:020 Look H2372 (8798) upon Zion H6726, the city H7151 of our solemnities H4150: thine eyes H5869 shall see H7200 (8799) Jerusalem H3389 a quiet H7600 habitation H5116, a tabernacle H0168 [that] shall not be taken down H6813 (8799); not one of the stakes H3489 thereof shall ever H5331 be removed H5265 (8799), neither shall any of the cords H2256 thereof be broken H5423 (8735).
033:021 But there the glorious H0117 LORD H3068 [will be] unto us a place H4725 of broad H7342 H3027 rivers H5104 [and] streams H2975; wherein shall go H3212 (8799) no H1077 galley H0590 with oars H7885, neither shall gallant H0117 ship H6716 pass H5674 (8799) thereby.
033:022 For the LORD H3068 [is] our judge H8199 (8802), the LORD H3068 [is] our lawgiver H2710 (8781), the LORD H3068 [is] our king H4428; he will save H3467 (8686) us.
033:023 Thy tacklings H2256 are loosed H5203 (8738); they could not well H3653 strengthen H2388 (8762) their mast H8650, they could not spread H6566 (8804) the sail H5251: then is the prey H5706 of a great H4766 spoil H7998 divided H2505 (8795); the lame H6455 take H0962 (8804) the prey H0957.
033:024 And the inhabitant H7934 shall not say H0559 (8799), I am sick H2470 (8804): the people H5971 that dwell H3427 (8802) therein [shall be] forgiven H5375 (8803) [their] iniquity H5771.
034:001 ¶  Come near H7126 (8798), ye nations H1471, to hear H8085 (8800); and hearken H7181 (8685), ye people H3816: let the earth H0776 hear H8085 (8799), and all that is therein H4393; the world H8398, and all things that come forth H6631 of it.
034:002 For the indignation H7110 of the LORD H3068 [is] upon all nations H1471, and [his] fury H2534 upon all their armies H6635: he hath utterly destroyed H2763 (8689) them, he hath delivered H5414 (8804) them to the slaughter H2874.
034:003 Their slain H2491 also shall be cast out H7993 (8714), and their stink H0889 shall come up H5927 (8799) out of their carcases H6297, and the mountains H2022 shall be melted H4549 (8738) with their blood H1818.
034:004 And all the host H6635 of heaven H8064 shall be dissolved H4743 (8738), and the heavens H8064 shall be rolled together H1556 (8738) as a scroll H5612: and all their host H6635 shall fall down H5034 (8799), as the leaf H5929 falleth off H5034 (8800) from the vine H1612, and as a falling H5034 (8802) [fig] from the fig tree H8384.
034:005 For my sword H2719 shall be bathed H7301 (8765) in heaven H8064: behold, it shall come down H3381 (8799) upon Idumea H0123, and upon the people H5971 of my curse H2764, to judgment H4941.
034:006 The sword H2719 of the LORD H3068 is filled H4390 (8804) with blood H1818, it is made fat H1878 (8719) with fatness H2459, [and] with the blood H1818 of lambs H3733 and goats H6260, with the fat H2459 of the kidneys H3629 of rams H0352: for the LORD H3068 hath a sacrifice H2077 in Bozrah H1224, and a great H1419 slaughter H2874 in the land H0776 of Idumea H0123.
034:007 And the unicorns H7214 shall come down H3381 (8804) with them, and the bullocks H6499 with the bulls H0047; and their land H0776 shall be soaked H7301 (8765) with blood H1818, and their dust H6083 made fat H1878 (8792) with fatness H2459.
034:008 For [it is] the day H3117 of the LORD’S H3068 vengeance H5359, [and] the year H8141 of recompences H7966 for the controversy H7379 of Zion H6726.
034:009 And the streams H5158 thereof shall be turned H2015 (8738) into pitch H2203, and the dust H6083 thereof into brimstone H1614, and the land H0776 thereof shall become burning H1197 (8802) pitch H2203.
034:010 It shall not be quenched H3518 (8799) night H3915 nor day H3119; the smoke H6227 thereof shall go up H5927 (8799) for ever H5769: from generation H1755 to generation H1755 it shall lie waste H2717 (8799); none shall pass through H5674 (8802) it for ever H5331 and ever H5331.
034:011 But the cormorant H6893 and the bittern H7090 shall possess H3423 (8804) it; the owl H3244 also and the raven H6158 shall dwell H7931 (8799) in it: and he shall stretch out H5186 (8804) upon it the line H6957 of confusion H8414, and the stones H0068 of emptiness H0922.
034:012 They shall call H7121 (8799) the nobles H2715 thereof to the kingdom H4410, but none [shall be] there, and all her princes H8269 shall be nothing H0657.
034:013 And thorns H5518 shall come up H5927 (8804) in her palaces H0759, nettles H7057 and brambles H2336 in the fortresses H4013 thereof: and it shall be an habitation H5116 of dragons H8577, [and] a court H2681 for owls H1323 H3284.
034:014 The wild beasts of the desert H6728 shall also meet H6298 (8804) with the wild beasts of the island H0338, and the satyr H8163 shall cry H7121 (8799) to his fellow H7453; the screech owl H3917 also shall rest H7280 (8689) there, and find H4672 (8804) for herself a place of rest H4494.
034:015 There shall the great owl H7091 make her nest H7077 (8765), and lay H4422 (8762), and hatch H1234 (8804), and gather H1716 (8804) under her shadow H6738: there shall the vultures H1772 also be gathered H6908 (8738), every one H0802 with her mate H7468.
034:016 Seek ye out H1875 (8798) of the book H5612 of the LORD H3068, and read H7121 (8798): no one H0259 of these H2007 shall fail H5737 (8738), none H0802 shall want H6485 (8804) her mate H7468: for my mouth H6310 it hath commanded H6680 (8765), and his spirit H7307 it hath gathered H6908 (8765) them.
034:017 And he hath cast H5307 (8689) the lot H1486 for them, and his hand H3027 hath divided H2505 (8765) it unto them by line H6957: they shall possess H3423 (8799) it for H5704 ever H5769, from generation H1755 to generation H1755 shall they dwell H7931 (8799) therein.
035:001 ¶  The wilderness H4057 and the solitary place H6723 shall be glad H7797 (8799) for them; and the desert H6160 shall rejoice H1523 (8799), and blossom H6524 (8799) as the rose H2261.
035:002 It shall blossom H6524 (8799) abundantly H6524 (8800), and rejoice H1523 (8799) even with joy H1525 and singing H7444 (8763): the glory H3519 of Lebanon H3844 shall be given H5414 (8738) unto it, the excellency H1926 of Carmel H3760 and Sharon H8289, they shall see H7200 (8799) the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068, [and] the excellency H1926 of our God H0430.
035:003 Strengthen H2388 (8761) ye the weak H7504 hands H3027, and confirm H0553 (8761) the feeble H3782 (8802) knees H1290.
035:004 Say H0559 (8798) to them [that are] of a fearful H4116 (8737) heart H3820, Be strong H2388 (8798), fear H3372 (8799) not: behold, your God H0430 will come H0935 (8799) [with] vengeance H5359, [even] God H0430 [with] a recompence H1576; he will come H0935 (8799) and save H3467 (8686) you.
035:005 Then the eyes H5869 of the blind H5787 shall be opened H6491 (8735), and the ears H0241 of the deaf H2795 shall be unstopped H6605 (8735).
035:006 Then shall the lame H6455 [man] leap H1801 (8762) as an hart H0354, and the tongue H3956 of the dumb H0483 sing H7442 (8799): for in the wilderness H4057 shall waters H4325 break out H1234 (8738), and streams H5158 in the desert H6160.
035:007 And the parched ground H8273 shall become a pool H0098, and the thirsty land H6774 springs H4002 of water H4325: in the habitation H5116 of dragons H8577, where each lay H7258, [shall be] grass H2682 with reeds H7070 and rushes H1573.
035:008 And an highway H4547 shall be there, and a way H1870, and it shall be called H7121 (8735) The way H1870 of holiness H6944; the unclean H2931 shall not pass over H5674 (8799) it; but it [shall be] for those: the wayfaring men H1980 (8802), though fools H0191, shall not err H8582 (8799) [therein].
035:009 No lion H0738 shall be there, nor [any] ravenous H6530 beast H2416 shall go up H5927 (8799) thereon, it shall not be found H4672 (8735) there; but the redeemed H1350 (8803) shall walk H1980 (8804) [there]:
035:010 And the ransomed H6299 (8803) of the LORD H3068 shall return H7725 (8799), and come H0935 (8804) to Zion H6726 with songs H7440 and everlasting H5769 joy H8057 upon their heads H7218: they shall obtain H5381 (8686) joy H8057 and gladness H8342, and sorrow H3015 and sighing H0585 shall flee away H5127 (8804).
036:001 ¶  Now it came to pass in the fourteenth H0702 H6240 year H8141 of king H4428 Hezekiah H2396, [that] Sennacherib H5576 king H4428 of Assyria H0804 came up H5927 (8804) against all the defenced H1219 (8803) cities H5892 of Judah H3063, and took H8610 (8799) them.
036:002 And the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 sent H7971 (8799) Rabshakeh H7262 from Lachish H3923 to Jerusalem H3389 unto king H4428 Hezekiah H2396 with a great H3515 army H2426. And he stood H5975 (8799) by the conduit H8585 of the upper H5945 pool H1295 in the highway H4546 of the fuller’s H3526 (8801) field H7704.
036:003 Then came forth H3318 (8799) unto him Eliakim H0471, Hilkiah’s H2518 son H1121, which was over the house H1004, and Shebna H7644 the scribe H5608 (8802), and Joah H3098, Asaph’s H0623 son H1121, the recorder H2142 (8688).
036:004 And Rabshakeh H7262 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Say H0559 (8798) ye now to Hezekiah H2396, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the great H1419 king H4428, the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, What confidence H0986 [is] this wherein thou trustest H0982 (8804)?
036:005 I say H0559 (8804), [sayest thou], (but [they are but] vain H8193 words H1697 ) [I have] counsel H6098 and strength H1369 for war H4421: now on whom dost thou trust H0982 (8804), that thou rebellest H4775 (8804) against me?
036:006 Lo, thou trustest H0982 (8804) in the staff H4938 of this broken H7533 (8803) reed H7070, on Egypt H4714; whereon if a man H0376 lean H5564 (8735), it will go H0935 (8804) into his hand H3709, and pierce H5344 (8804) it: so [is] Pharaoh H6547 king H4428 of Egypt H4714 to all that trust H0982 (8802) in him.
036:007 But if thou say H0559 (8799) to me, We trust H0982 (8804) in the LORD H3068 our God H0430: [is it] not he, whose high places H1116 and whose altars H4196 Hezekiah H2396 hath taken away H5493 (8689), and said H0559 (8799) to Judah H3063 and to Jerusalem H3389, Ye shall worship H7812 (8691) before H6440 this altar H4196?
036:008 Now therefore give pledges H6148 (8690), I pray thee, to my master H0113 the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, and I will give H5414 (8799) thee two thousand H0505 horses H5483, if thou be able H3201 (8799) on thy part to set H5414 (8800) riders H7392 (8802) upon them.
036:009 How then wilt thou turn away H7725 (8686) the face H6440 of one H0259 captain H6346 of the least H6996 of my master’s H0113 servants H5650, and put thy trust H0982 (8799) on Egypt H4714 for chariots H7393 and for horsemen H6571?
036:010 And am I now come up H5927 (8804) without H1107 the LORD H3068 against this land H0776 to destroy H7843 (8687) it? the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8804) unto me, Go up H5927 (8798) against this land H0776, and destroy H7843 (8685) it.
036:011 Then said H0559 (8799) Eliakim H0471 and Shebna H7644 and Joah H3098 unto Rabshakeh H7262, Speak H1696 (8761), I pray thee, unto thy servants H5650 in the Syrian language H0762; for we understand H8085 (8802) [it]: and speak H1696 (8762) not to us in the Jews’ language H3066, in the ears H0241 of the people H5971 that [are] on the wall H2346.
036:012 But Rabshakeh H7262 said H0559 (8799), Hath my master H0113 sent H7971 (8804) me to thy master H0113 and to thee to speak H1696 (8763) these words H1697? [hath he] not [sent me] to the men H0582 that sit H3427 (8802) upon the wall H2346, that they may eat H0398 (8800) their own dung H2716 (8676) H6675, and drink H8354 (8800) their own piss H4325 H7272 (8675) H7890 with you?
036:013 Then Rabshakeh H7262 stood H5975 (8799), and cried H7121 (8799) with a loud H1419 voice H6963 in the Jews’ language H3066, and said H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798) ye the words H1697 of the great H1419 king H4428, the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
036:014 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the king H4428, Let not Hezekiah H2396 deceive H5377 (8686) you: for he shall not be able H3201 (8799) to deliver H5337 (8687) you.
036:015 Neither let Hezekiah H2396 make you trust H0982 (8686) in the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 will surely H5337 (8687) deliver H5337 (8686) us: this city H5892 shall not be delivered H5414 (8735) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
036:016 Hearken H8085 (8799) not to Hezekiah H2396: for thus saith H0559 (8804) the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, Make H6213 (8798) [an agreement] with me [by] a present H1293, and come out H3318 (8798) to me: and eat H0398 (8798) ye every one H0376 of his vine H1612, and every one H0376 of his fig tree H8384, and drink H8354 (8798) ye every one H0376 the waters H4325 of his own cistern H0953;
036:017 Until I come H0935 (8800) and take you away H3947 (8804) to a land H0776 like your own land H0776, a land H0776 of corn H1715 and wine H8492, a land H0776 of bread H3899 and vineyards H3754.
036:018 [Beware] lest Hezekiah H2396 persuade H5496 (8686) you, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 will deliver H5337 (8686) us. Hath any H0376 of the gods H0430 of the nations H1471 delivered H5337 (8689) his land H0776 out of the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804?
036:019 Where [are] the gods H0430 of Hamath H2574 and Arphad H0774? where [are] the gods H0430 of Sepharvaim H5617? and have they delivered H5337 (8689) Samaria H8111 out of my hand H3027?
036:020 Who [are they] among all the gods H0430 of these lands H0776, that have delivered H5337 (8689) their land H0776 out of my hand H3027, that the LORD H3068 should deliver H5337 (8686) Jerusalem H3389 out of my hand H3027?
036:021 But they held their peace H2790 (8686), and answered H6030 (8804) him not a word H1697: for the king’s H4428 commandment H4687 was, saying H0559 (8800), Answer H6030 (8799) him not.
036:022 Then came H0935 (8799) Eliakim H0471, the son H1121 of Hilkiah H2518, that [was] over the household H1004, and Shebna H7644 the scribe H5608 (8802), and Joah H3098, the son H1121 of Asaph H0623, the recorder H2142 (8688), to Hezekiah H2396 with [their] clothes H0899 rent H7167 (8803), and told H5046 (8686) him the words H1697 of Rabshakeh H7262.
037:001 ¶  And it came to pass, when king H4428 Hezekiah H2396 heard H8085 (8800) [it], that he rent H7167 (8799) his clothes H0899, and covered H3680 (8691) himself with sackcloth H8242, and went H0935 (8799) into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
037:002 And he sent H7971 (8799) Eliakim H0471, who [was] over the household H1004, and Shebna H7644 the scribe H5608 (8802), and the elders H2205 of the priests H3548 covered H3680 (8693) with sackcloth H8242, unto Isaiah H3470 the prophet H5030 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531.
037:003 And they said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) Hezekiah H2396, This day H3117 [is] a day H3117 of trouble H6869, and of rebuke H8433, and of blasphemy H5007: for the children H1121 are come H0935 (8804) to the birth H4866, and [there is] not strength H3581 to bring forth H3205 (8800).
037:004 It may be the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will hear H8085 (8799) the words H1697 of Rabshakeh H7262, whom the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 his master H0113 hath sent H7971 (8804) to reproach H2778 (8763) the living H2416 God H0430, and will reprove H3198 (8689) the words H1697 which the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 hath heard H8085 (8804): wherefore lift up H5375 (8804) [thy] prayer H8605 for the remnant H7611 that is left H4672 (8737).
037:005 So the servants H5650 of king H4428 Hezekiah H2396 came H0935 (8799) to Isaiah H3470.
037:006 And Isaiah H3470 said H0559 (8799) unto them, Thus shall ye say H0559 (8799) unto your master H0113, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Be not afraid H3372 (8799) of H6440 the words H1697 that thou hast heard H8085 (8804), wherewith the servants H5288 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 have blasphemed H1442 (8765) me.
037:007 Behold, I will send H5414 (8802) a blast H7307 upon him, and he shall hear H8085 (8804) a rumour H8052, and return H7725 (8804) to his own land H0776; and I will cause him to fall H5307 (8689) by the sword H2719 in his own land H0776.
037:008 So Rabshakeh H7262 returned H7725 (8799), and found H4672 (8799) the king H4428 of Assyria H0804 warring H3898 (8737) against Libnah H3841: for he had heard H8085 (8804) that he was departed H5265 (8804) from Lachish H3923.
037:009 And he heard H8085 (8799) say H0559 (8800) concerning Tirhakah H8640 king H4428 of Ethiopia H3568, He is come forth H3318 (8804) to make war H3898 (8736) with thee. And when he heard H8085 (8799) [it], he sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to Hezekiah H2396, saying H0559 (8800),
037:010 Thus shall ye speak H0559 (8799) to Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063, saying H0559 (8800), Let not thy God H0430, in whom thou trustest H0982 (8802), deceive H5377 (8686) thee, saying H0559 (8800), Jerusalem H3389 shall not be given H5414 (8735) into the hand H3027 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804.
037:011 Behold, thou hast heard H8085 (8804) what the kings H4428 of Assyria H0804 have done H6213 (8804) to all lands H0776 by destroying them utterly H2763 (8687); and shalt thou be delivered H5337 (8735)?
037:012 Have the gods H0430 of the nations H1471 delivered H5337 (8689) them which my fathers H0001 have destroyed H7843 (8689), [as] Gozan H1470, and Haran H2771, and Rezeph H7530, and the children H1121 of Eden H5729 which [were] in Telassar H8515?
037:013 Where [is] the king H4428 of Hamath H2574, and the king H4428 of Arphad H0774, and the king H4428 of the city H5892 of Sepharvaim H5617, Hena H2012, and Ivah H5755?
037:014 And Hezekiah H2396 received H3947 (8799) the letter H5612 from the hand H3027 of the messengers H4397, and read H7121 (8799) it: and Hezekiah H2396 went up H5927 (8799) unto the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and spread H6566 (8799) it before H6440 the LORD H3068.
037:015 And Hezekiah H2396 prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068, saying H0559 (8800),
037:016 O LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, God H0430 of Israel H3478, that dwellest H3427 (8802) [between] the cherubims H3742, thou [art] the God H0430, [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776: thou hast made H6213 (8804) heaven H8064 and earth H0776.
037:017 Incline H5186 (8685) thine ear H0241, O LORD H3068, and hear H8085 (8798); open H6491 (8798) thine eyes H5869, O LORD H3068, and see H7200 (8798): and hear H8085 (8798) all the words H1697 of Sennacherib H5576, which hath sent H7971 (8804) to reproach H2778 (8763) the living H2416 God H0430.
037:018 Of a truth H0551, LORD H3068, the kings H4428 of Assyria H0804 have laid waste H2717 (8689) all the nations H0776, and their countries H0776,
037:019 And have cast H5414 (8800) their gods H0430 into the fire H0784: for they [were] no gods H0430, but the work H4639 of men’s H0120 hands H3027, wood H6086 and stone H0068: therefore they have destroyed H0006 (8762) them.
037:020 Now therefore, O LORD H3068 our God H0430, save H3467 (8685) us from his hand H3027, that all the kingdoms H4467 of the earth H0776 may know H3045 (8799) that thou [art] the LORD H3068, [even] thou only.
037:021 Then Isaiah H3470 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531 sent H7971 (8799) unto Hezekiah H2396, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478, Whereas thou hast prayed H6419 (8694) to me against Sennacherib H5576 king H4428 of Assyria H0804:
037:022 This [is] the word H1697 which the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) concerning him; The virgin H1330, the daughter H1323 of Zion H6726, hath despised H0959 (8804) thee, [and] laughed thee to scorn; H3932 (8804) the daughter H1323 of Jerusalem H3389 hath shaken H5128 (8689) her head H7218 at thee H0310.
037:023 Whom hast thou reproached H2778 (8765) and blasphemed H1442 (8765)? and against whom hast thou exalted H7311 (8689) [thy] voice H6963, and lifted up H5375 (8799) thine eyes H5869 on high H4791? [even] against the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
037:024 By H3027 thy servants H5650 hast thou reproached H2778 (8765) the Lord H0136, and hast said H0559 (8799), By the multitude H7230 of my chariots H7393 am I come up H5927 (8804) to the height H4791 of the mountains H2022, to the sides H3411 of Lebanon H3844; and I will cut down H3772 (8799) the tall H6967 cedars H0730 thereof, [and] the choice H4005 fir trees H1265 thereof: and I will enter H0935 (8799) into the height H4791 of his border H7093, [and] the forest H3293 of his Carmel H3760.
037:025 I have digged H6979 (8804), and drunk H8354 (8804) water H4325; and with the sole H3709 of my feet H6471 have I dried up H2717 (8686) all the rivers H2975 of the besieged places H4693.
037:026 Hast thou not heard H8085 (8804) long ago H7350, [how] I have done H6213 (8804) it; [and] of ancient H6924 times H3117, that I have formed H3335 (8804) it? now have I brought H0935 (8689) it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste H7582 (8687) defenced H1219 (8803) cities H5892 [into] ruinous H5327 (8737) heaps H1530.
037:027 Therefore their inhabitants H3427 (8802) [were] of small H7116 power H3027, they were dismayed H2865 (8804) and confounded H0954 (8804): they were [as] the grass H6212 of the field H7704, and [as] the green H3419 herb H1877, [as] the grass H2682 on the housetops H1406, and [as corn] blasted H7709 before H6440 it be grown up H7054.
037:028 But I know H3045 (8804) thy abode H3427 (8800), and thy going out H3318 (8800), and thy coming in H0935 (8800), and thy rage H7264 (8692) against me.
037:029 Because thy rage H7264 (8692) against me, and thy tumult H7600, is come up H5927 (8804) into mine ears H0241, therefore will I put H7760 (8804) my hook H2397 in thy nose H0639, and my bridle H4964 in thy lips H8193, and I will turn thee back H7725 (8689) by the way H1870 by which thou camest H0935 (8804).
037:030 And this [shall be] a sign H0226 unto thee, Ye shall eat H0398 (8800) [this] year H8141 such as groweth H5599 of itself; and the second H8145 year H8141 that which springeth H7823 of the same: and in the third H7992 year H8141 sow H2232 (8798) ye, and reap H7114 (8798), and plant H5193 (8798) vineyards H3754, and eat H0398 (8798) the fruit H6529 thereof.
037:031 And the remnant H7604 (8737) that is escaped H6413 of the house H1004 of Judah H3063 shall again H3254 (8804) take root H8328 downward H4295, and bear H6213 (8804) fruit H6529 upward H4605:
037:032 For out of Jerusalem H3389 shall go forth H3318 (8799) a remnant H7611, and they that escape H6413 out of mount H2022 Zion H6726: the zeal H7068 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 shall do H6213 (8799) this.
037:033 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 concerning the king H4428 of Assyria H0804, He shall not come H0935 (8799) into this city H5892, nor shoot H3384 (8686) an arrow H2671 there, nor come before H6923 (8762) it with shields H4043, nor cast H8210 (8799) a bank H5550 against it.
037:034 By the way H1870 that he came H0935 (8804), by the same shall he return H7725 (8799), and shall not come H0935 (8799) into this city H5892, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
037:035 For I will defend H1598 (8804) this city H5892 to save H3467 (8687) it for mine own sake, and for my servant H5650 David’s H1732 sake.
037:036 Then the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 went forth H3318 (8799), and smote H5221 (8686) in the camp H4264 of the Assyrians H0804 a hundred H3967 and fourscore H8084 and five H2568 thousand H0505: and when they arose early H7925 (8686) in the morning H1242, behold, they [were] all dead H4191 (8801) corpses H6297.
037:037 So Sennacherib H5576 king H4428 of Assyria H0804 departed H5265 (8799), and went H3212 (8799) and returned H7725 (8799), and dwelt H3427 (8799) at Nineveh H5210.
037:038 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping H7812 (8693) in the house H1004 of Nisroch H5268 his god H0430, that Adrammelech H0152 and Sharezer H8272 his sons H1121 smote H5221 (8689) him with the sword H2719; and they escaped H4422 (8738) into the land H0776 of Armenia H0780: and Esarhaddon H0634 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
038:001 ¶  In those days H3117 was Hezekiah H2396 sick H2470 (8804) unto death H4191 (8800). And Isaiah H3470 the prophet H5030 the son H1121 of Amoz H0531 came H0935 (8799) unto him, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Set thine house H1004 in order H6680 (8761): for thou shalt die H4191 (8801), and not live H2421 (8799).
038:002 Then Hezekiah H2396 turned H5437 (8686) his face H6440 toward the wall H7023, and prayed H6419 (8691) unto the LORD H3068,
038:003 And said H0559 (8799), Remember H2142 (8798) now, O LORD H3068, I beseech H0577 thee, how I have walked H1980 (8694) before H6440 thee in truth H0571 and with a perfect H8003 heart H3820, and have done H6213 (8804) [that which is] good H2896 in thy sight H5869. And Hezekiah H2396 wept H1058 (8799) H1065 sore H1419.
038:004 Then came the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 to Isaiah H3470, saying H0559 (8800),
038:005 Go H1980 (8800), and say H0559 (8804) to Hezekiah H2396, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the God H0430 of David H1732 thy father H0001, I have heard H8085 (8804) thy prayer H8605, I have seen H7200 (8804) thy tears H1832: behold, I will add H3254 (8802) unto thy days H3117 fifteen H2568 H6240 years H8141.
038:006 And I will deliver H5337 (8686) thee and this city H5892 out of the hand H3709 of the king H4428 of Assyria H0804: and I will defend H1598 (8804) this city H5892.
038:007 And this [shall be] a sign H0226 unto thee from the LORD H3068, that the LORD H3068 will do H6213 (8799) this thing H1697 that he hath spoken H1696 (8765);
038:008 Behold, I will bring again H7725 (8688) the shadow H6738 of the degrees H4609, which is gone down H3381 (8804) in the sun H8121 dial H4609 of Ahaz H0271, ten H6235 degrees H4609 backward H0322. So the sun H8121 returned H7725 (8799) ten H6235 degrees H4609, by which degrees H4609 it was gone down H3381 (8804).
038:009 The writing H4385 of Hezekiah H2396 king H4428 of Judah H3063, when he had been sick H2470 (8800), and was recovered H2421 (8799) of his sickness H2483:
038:010 I said H0559 (8804) in the cutting off H1824 of my days H3117, I shall go H3212 (8799) to the gates H8179 of the grave H7585: I am deprived H6485 (8795) of the residue H3499 of my years H8141.
038:011 I said H0559 (8804), I shall not see H7200 (8799) the LORD H3050, [even] the LORD H3050, in the land H0776 of the living H2416: I shall behold H5027 (8686) man H0120 no more with the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the world H2309.
038:012 Mine age H1755 is departed H5265 (8738), and is removed H1540 (8738) from me as a shepherd’s H7473 tent H0168: I have cut off H7088 (8765) like a weaver H0707 (8802) my life H2416: he will cut me off H1214 (8762) with pining sickness H1803: from day H3117 [even] to night H3915 wilt thou make an end H7999 (8686) of me.
038:013 I reckoned H7737 (8765) till morning H1242, [that], as a lion H0738, so will he break H7665 (8762) all my bones H6106: from day H3117 [even] to night H3915 wilt thou make an end H7999 (8686) of me.
038:014 Like a crane H5483 [or] a swallow H5693, so did I chatter H6850 (8770): I did mourn H1897 (8799) as a dove H3123: mine eyes H5869 fail H1809 (8804) [with looking] upward H4791: O LORD H3068, I am oppressed H6234; undertake H6148 (8798) for me.
038:015 What shall I say H1696 (8762)? he hath both spoken H0559 (8804) unto me, and himself hath done H6213 (8804) [it]: I shall go softly H1718 (8691) all my years H8141 in the bitterness H4751 of my soul H5315.
038:016 O Lord H0136, by these [things men] live H2421 (8799), and in all these [things is] the life H2416 of my spirit H7307: so wilt thou recover H2492 (8686) me, and make me to live H2421 (8685).
038:017 Behold, for peace H7965 I had great bitterness H4751 H4843 (8804): but thou hast in love H2836 (8804) to my soul H5315 [delivered it] from the pit H7845 of corruption H1097: for thou hast cast H7993 (8689) all my sins H2399 behind H0310 thy back H1460.
038:018 For the grave H7585 cannot praise H3034 (8686) thee, death H4194 can [not] celebrate H1984 (8762) thee: they that go down H3381 (8802) into the pit H0953 cannot hope H7663 (8762) for thy truth H0571.
038:019 The living H2416, the living H2416, he shall praise H3034 (8686) thee, as I [do] this day H3117: the father H0001 to the children H1121 shall make known H3045 (8686) thy truth H0571.
038:020 The LORD H3068 [was ready] to save H3467 (8687) me: therefore we will sing my songs H5058 to the stringed instruments H5059 (8762) all the days H3117 of our life H2416 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
038:021 For Isaiah H3470 had said H0559 (8799), Let them take H5375 (8799) a lump H1690 of figs H8384, and lay [it] for a plaister H4799 (8799) upon the boil H7822, and he shall recover H2421 (8799).
038:022 Hezekiah H2396 also had said H0559 (8799), What [is] the sign H0226 that I shall go up H5927 (8799) to the house H1004 of the LORD H3068?
039:001 ¶  At that time H6256 Merodachbaladan H4757, the son H1121 of Baladan H1081, king H4428 of Babylon H0894, sent H7971 (8804) letters H5612 and a present H4503 to Hezekiah H2396: for he had heard H8085 (8799) that he had been sick H2470 (8804), and was recovered H2388 (8799).
039:002 And Hezekiah H2396 was glad H8055 (8799) of them, and shewed H7200 (8686) them the house H1004 of his precious things H5238, the silver H3701, and the gold H2091, and the spices H1314, and the precious H2896 ointment H8081, and all the house H1004 of his armour H3627, and all that was found H4672 (8738) in his treasures H0214: there was nothing H1697 in his house H1004, nor in all his dominion H4475, that Hezekiah H2396 shewed H7200 (8689) them not.
039:003 Then came H0935 (8799) Isaiah H3470 the prophet H5030 unto king H4428 Hezekiah H2396, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, What said H0559 (8804) these men H0582? and from whence H0370 came H0935 (8799) they unto thee? And Hezekiah H2396 said H0559 (8799), They are come H0935 (8804) from a far H7350 country H0776 unto me, [even] from Babylon H0894.
039:004 Then said H0559 (8799) he, What have they seen H7200 (8804) in thine house H1004? And Hezekiah H2396 answered H0559 (8799), All that [is] in mine house H1004 have they seen H7200 (8804): there is nothing H1697 among my treasures H0214 that I have not shewed H7200 (8689) them.
039:005 Then said H0559 (8799) Isaiah H3470 to Hezekiah H2396, Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635:
039:006 Behold, the days H3117 come H0935 (8802), that all that [is] in thine house H1004, and [that] which thy fathers H0001 have laid up in store H0686 (8804) until this day H3117, shall be carried H5375 (8738) to Babylon H0894: nothing H1697 shall be left H3498 (8735), saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
039:007 And of thy sons H1121 that shall issue H3318 (8799) from thee, which thou shalt beget H3205 (8686), shall they take away H3947 (8799); and they shall be eunuchs H5631 in the palace H1964 of the king H4428 of Babylon H0894.
039:008 Then said H0559 (8799) Hezekiah H2396 to Isaiah H3470, Good H2896 [is] the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 which thou hast spoken H1696 (8765). He said H0559 (8799) moreover, For there shall be peace H7965 and truth H0571 in my days H3117.
040:001 ¶  Comfort H5162 (8761) ye, comfort H5162 (8761) ye my people H5971, saith H0559 (8799) your God H0430.
040:002 Speak H1696 (8761) ye comfortably H3820 to Jerusalem H3389, and cry H7121 (8798) unto her, that her warfare H6635 is accomplished H4390 (8804), that her iniquity H5771 is pardoned H7521 (8738): for she hath received H3947 (8804) of the LORD’S H3068 hand H3027 double H3718 for all her sins H2403.
040:003 The voice H6963 of him that crieth H7121 (8802) in the wilderness H4057, Prepare H6437 (8761) ye the way H1870 of the LORD H3068, make straight H3474 (8761) in the desert H6160 a highway H4546 for our God H0430.
040:004 Every valley H1516 shall be exalted H5375 (8735), and every mountain H2022 and hill H1389 shall be made low H8213 (8799): and the crooked H6121 shall be made straight H4334, and the rough places H7406 plain H1237:
040:005 And the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 shall be revealed H1540 (8738), and all flesh H1320 shall see H7200 (8804) [it] together H3162: for the mouth H6310 of the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
040:006 The voice H6963 said H0559 (8802), Cry H7121 (8798). And he said H0559 (8804), What shall I cry H7121 (8799)? All flesh H1320 [is] grass H2682, and all the goodliness H2617 thereof [is] as the flower H6731 of the field H7704:
040:007 The grass H2682 withereth H3001 (8804), the flower H6731 fadeth H5034 (8804): because the spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 bloweth H5380 (8804) upon it: surely H0403 the people H5971 [is] grass H2682.
040:008 The grass H2682 withereth H3001 (8804), the flower H6731 fadeth H5034 (8804): but the word H1697 of our God H0430 shall stand H6965 (8799) for ever H5769.
040:009 O Zion H6726, that bringest good tidings H1319 (8764), get thee up H5927 (8798) into the high H1364 mountain H2022; O Jerusalem H3389, that bringest good tidings H1319 (8764), lift up H7311 (8685) thy voice H6963 with strength H3581; lift [it] up H7311 (8685), be not afraid H3372 (8799); say H0559 (8798) unto the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, Behold your God H0430!
040:010 Behold, the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 will come H0935 (8799) with strong H2389 [hand], and his arm H2220 shall rule H4910 (8802) for him: behold, his reward H7939 [is] with him, and his work H6468 before H6440 him.
040:011 He shall feed H7462 (8799) his flock H5739 like a shepherd H7462 (8802): he shall gather H6908 (8762) the lambs H2922 with his arm H2220, and carry H5375 (8799) [them] in his bosom H2436, [and] shall gently lead H5095 (8762) those that are with young H5763 (8802).
040:012 Who hath measured H4058 (8804) the waters H4325 in the hollow of his hand H8168, and meted out H8505 (8765) heaven H8064 with the span H2239, and comprehended H3557 (8804) the dust H6083 of the earth H0776 in a measure H7991, and weighed H8254 (8804) the mountains H2022 in scales H6425, and the hills H1389 in a balance H3976?
040:013 Who hath directed H8505 (8765) the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068, or [being] his counsellor H0376 H6098 hath taught H3045 (8686) him?
040:014 With whom took he counsel H3289 (8738), and [who] instructed H0995 (8799) him, and taught H3925 (8762) him in the path H0734 of judgment H4941, and taught H3925 (8762) him knowledge H1847, and shewed H3045 (8686) to him the way H1870 of understanding H8394?
040:015 Behold, the nations H1471 [are] as a drop H4752 of a bucket H1805, and are counted H2803 (8738) as the small dust H7834 of the balance H3976: behold, he taketh up H5190 (8799) the isles H0339 as a very little thing H1851.
040:016 And Lebanon H3844 [is] not H0369 sufficient H1767 to burn H1197 (8763), nor the beasts H2416 thereof sufficient H1767 for a burnt offering H5930.
040:017 All nations H1471 before him [are] as nothing; and they are counted H2803 (8738) to him less than nothing H0657, and vanity H8414.
040:018 To whom then will ye liken H1819 (8762) God H0410? or what likeness H1823 will ye compare H6186 (8799) unto him?
040:019 The workman H2796 melteth H5258 (8804) a graven image H6459, and the goldsmith H6884 (8802) spreadeth H7554 (8762) it over with gold H2091, and casteth H6884 (8802) silver H3701 chains H7577.
040:020 He that [is] so impoverished H5533 (8794) (8676) H5534 (8765) that he hath no oblation H8641 chooseth H0977 (8799) a tree H6086 [that] will not rot H7537 (8799); he seeketh H1245 (8762) unto him a cunning H2450 workman H2796 to prepare H3559 (8687) a graven image H6459, [that] shall not be moved H4131 (8735).
040:021 Have ye not known H3045 (8799)? have ye not heard H8085 (8799)? hath it not been told H5046 (8717) you from the beginning H7218? have ye not understood H0995 (8689) from the foundations H4146 of the earth H0776?
040:022 [It is] he that sitteth H3427 (8802) upon the circle H2329 of the earth H0776, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof [are] as grasshoppers H2284; that stretcheth out H5186 (8802) the heavens H8064 as a curtain H1852, and spreadeth them out H4969 (8799) as a tent H0168 to dwell in H3427 (8800):
040:023 That bringeth H5414 (8802) the princes H7336 (8802) to nothing; he maketh H6213 (8804) the judges H8199 (8802) of the earth H0776 as vanity H8414.
040:024 Yea, they shall not be planted H5193 (8738); yea, they shall not be sown H2232 (8795): yea, their stock H1503 shall not take root H8327 (8782) in the earth H0776: and he shall also blow H5398 (8804) upon them, and they shall wither H3001 (8799), and the whirlwind H5591 shall take H5375 (8799) them away as stubble H7179.
040:025 To whom then will ye liken H1819 (8762) me, or shall I be equal H7737 (8799)? saith H0559 (8799) the Holy One H6918.
040:026 Lift up H5375 (8798) your eyes H5869 on high H4791, and behold H7200 (8798) who hath created H1254 (8804) these [things], that bringeth out H3318 (8688) their host H6635 by number H4557: he calleth H7121 (8799) them all by names H8034 by the greatness H7230 of his might H0202, for that [he is] strong H0533 in power H3581; not one H0376 faileth H5737 (8738).
040:027 Why sayest H0559 (8799) thou, O Jacob H3290, and speakest H1696 (8762), O Israel H3478, My way H1870 is hid H5641 (8738) from the LORD H3068, and my judgment H4941 is passed over H5674 (8799) from my God H0430?
040:028 Hast thou not known H3045 (8804)? hast thou not heard H8085 (8804), [that] the everlasting H5769 God H0430, the LORD H3068, the Creator H1254 (8802) of the ends H7098 of the earth H0776, fainteth H3286 (8799) not, neither is weary H3021 (8799)? [there is] no searching H2714 of his understanding H8394.
040:029 He giveth H5414 (8802) power H3581 to the faint H3287; and to [them that have] no might H0202 he increaseth H7235 (8686) strength H6109.
040:030 Even the youths H5288 shall faint H3286 (8799) and be weary H3021 (8799), and the young men H0970 shall utterly H3782 (8800) fall H3782 (8735):
040:031 But they that wait H6960 (8802) upon the LORD H3068 shall renew H2498 (8686) [their] strength H3581; they shall mount up H5927 (8799) with wings H0083 as eagles H5404; they shall run H7323 (8799), and not be weary H3021 (8799); [and] they shall walk H3212 (8799), and not faint H3286 (8799).
041:001 ¶  Keep silence H2790 (8685) before me, O islands H0339; and let the people H3816 renew H2498 (8686) [their] strength H3581: let them come near H5066 (8799); then let them speak H1696 (8762): let us come near H7126 (8799) together H3162 to judgment H4941.
041:002 Who raised up H5782 (8689) the righteous H6664 [man] from the east H4217, called H7121 (8799) him to his foot H7272, gave H5414 (8799) the nations H1471 before H6440 him, and made [him] rule H7287 (8686) over kings H4428? he gave H5414 (8799) [them] as the dust H6083 to his sword H2719, [and] as driven H5086 (8737) stubble H7179 to his bow H7198.
041:003 He pursued H7291 (8799) them, [and] passed H5674 (8799) safely H7965; [even] by the way H0734 [that] he had not gone H0935 (8799) with his feet H7272.
041:004 Who hath wrought H6466 (8804) and done H6213 (8804) [it], calling H7121 (8802) the generations H1755 from the beginning H7218? I the LORD H3068, the first H7223, and with the last H0314; I [am] he.
041:005 The isles H0339 saw H7200 (8804) [it], and feared H3372 (8799); the ends H7098 of the earth H0776 were afraid H2729 (8799), drew near H7126 (8804), and came H0857 (8799).
041:006 They helped H5826 (8799) every one H0376 his neighbour H7453; and [every one] said H0559 (8799) to his brother H0251, Be of good courage H2388 (8798).
041:007 So the carpenter H2796 encouraged H2388 (8762) the goldsmith H6884 (8802), [and] he that smootheth H2505 (8688) [with] the hammer H6360 him that smote H1986 (8802) the anvil H6471, saying H0559 (8802), It [is] ready H2896 for the sodering H1694: and he fastened H2388 (8762) it with nails H4548, [that] it should not be moved H4131 (8735).
041:008 But thou, Israel H3478, [art] my servant H5650, Jacob H3290 whom I have chosen H0977 (8804), the seed H2233 of Abraham H0085 my friend H0157 (8802).
041:009 [Thou] whom I have taken H2388 (8689) from the ends H7098 of the earth H0776, and called H7121 (8804) thee from the chief men H0678 thereof, and said H0559 (8799) unto thee, Thou [art] my servant H5650; I have chosen H0977 (8804) thee, and not cast thee away H3988 (8804).
041:010 Fear H3372 (8799) thou not; for I [am] with thee: be not dismayed H8159 (8691); for I [am] thy God H0430: I will strengthen H0553 (8765) thee; yea, I will help H5826 (8804) thee; yea, I will uphold H8551 (8804) thee with the right hand H3225 of my righteousness H6664.
041:011 Behold, all they that were incensed H2734 (8737) against thee shall be ashamed H0954 (8799) and confounded H3637 (8735): they shall be as nothing; and they H0582 that strive H7379 with thee shall perish H0006 (8799).
041:012 Thou shalt seek H1245 (8762) them, and shalt not find H4672 (8799) them, [even] them H0582 that contended H4695 with thee: they that war H4421 against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought H0657.
041:013 For I the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 will hold H2388 (8688) thy right hand H3225, saying H0559 (8802) unto thee, Fear H3372 (8799) not; I will help H5826 (8804) thee.
041:014 Fear H3372 (8799) not, thou worm H8438 Jacob H3290, [and] ye men H4962 of Israel H3478; I will help H5826 (8804) thee, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and thy redeemer H1350 (8802), the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
041:015 Behold, I will make H7760 (8804) thee a new H2319 sharp H2742 threshing H4173 instrument having H1167 teeth H6374: thou shalt thresh H1758 (8799) the mountains H2022, and beat [them] small H1854 (8799), and shalt make H7760 (8799) the hills H1389 as chaff H4671.
041:016 Thou shalt fan H2219 (8799) them, and the wind H7307 shall carry them away H5375 (8799), and the whirlwind H5591 shall scatter H6327 (8686) them: and thou shalt rejoice H1523 (8799) in the LORD H3068, [and] shalt glory H1984 (8691) in the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
041:017 [When] the poor H6041 and needy H0034 seek H1245 (8764) water H4325, and [there is] none, [and] their tongue H3956 faileth H5405 (8804) for thirst H6772, I the LORD H3068 will hear H6030 (8799) them, I the God H0430 of Israel H3478 will not forsake H5800 (8799) them.
041:018 I will open H6605 (8799) rivers H5104 in high places H8205, and fountains H4599 in the midst H8432 of the valleys H1237: I will make H7760 (8799) the wilderness H4057 a pool H0098 of water H4325, and the dry H6723 land H0776 springs H4161 of water H4325.
041:019 I will plant H5414 (8799) in the wilderness H4057 the cedar H0730, the shittah tree H7848, and the myrtle H1918, and the oil H8081 tree H6086; I will set H7760 (8799) in the desert H6160 the fir tree H1265, [and] the pine H8410, and the box tree H8391 together H3162:
041:020 That they may see H7200 (8799), and know H3045 (8799), and consider H7760 (8799), and understand H7919 (8686) together H3162, that the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 hath done H6213 (8804) this, and the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478 hath created H1254 (8804) it.
041:021 Produce H7126 (8761) your cause H7379, saith H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068; bring forth H5066 (8685) your strong H6110 [reasons], saith H0559 (8799) the King H4428 of Jacob H3290.
041:022 Let them bring [them] forth H5066 (8686), and shew H5046 (8686) us what shall happen H7136 (8799): let them shew H5046 (8685) the former things H7223, what they [be], that we may consider H7760 (8799) H3820 them, and know H3045 (8799) the latter end H0319 of them; or declare H8085 (8685) us things for to come H0935 (8802).
041:023 Shew H5046 (8685) the things that are to come H0857 (8802) hereafter H0268, that we may know H3045 (8799) that ye [are] gods H0430: yea, do good H3190 (8686), or do evil H7489 (8686), that we may be dismayed H8159 (8691), and behold H7200 (8799) [it] together H3162.
041:024 Behold, ye [are] of nothing H0369, and your work H6467 of nought H0659: an abomination H8441 [is he that] chooseth H0977 (8799) you.
041:025 I have raised up H5782 (8689) [one] from the north H6828, and he shall come H0857 (8799): from the rising H4217 of the sun H8121 shall he call H7121 (8799) upon my name H8034: and he shall come H0935 (8799) upon princes H5461 as [upon] morter H2563, and as the potter H3335 (8802) treadeth H7429 (8799) clay H2916.
041:026 Who hath declared H5046 (8689) from the beginning H7218, that we may know H3045 (8799)? and beforetime H6440, that we may say H0559 (8799), [He is] righteous H6662? yea, [there is] none that sheweth H5046 (8688), yea, [there is] none that declareth H8085 (8688), yea, [there is] none that heareth H8085 (8802) your words H0561.
041:027 The first H7223 [shall say] to Zion H6726, Behold H2009, behold H2009 them: and I will give H5414 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389 one that bringeth good tidings H1319 (8764).
041:028 For I beheld H7200 (8799), and [there was] no man H0376; even among them, and [there was] no counsellor H3289 (8802), that, when I asked H7592 (8799) of them, could answer H7725 (8686) a word H1697.
041:029 Behold, they [are] all vanity H0205; their works H4639 [are] nothing H0657: their molten images H5262 [are] wind H7307 and confusion H8414.
042:001 ¶  Behold my servant H5650, whom I uphold H8551 (8799); mine elect H0972, [in whom] my soul H5315 delighteth H7521 (8804); I have put H5414 (8804) my spirit H7307 upon him: he shall bring forth H3318 (8686) judgment H4941 to the Gentiles H1471.
042:002 He shall not cry H6817 (8799), nor lift up H5375 (8799), nor cause his voice H6963 to be heard H8085 (8686) in the street H2351.
042:003 A bruised H7533 (8803) reed H7070 shall he not break H7665 (8799), and the smoking H3544 flax H6594 shall he not quench H3518 (8762): he shall bring forth H3318 (8686) judgment H4941 unto truth H0571.
042:004 He shall not fail H3543 (8799) nor be discouraged H7533 (8799), till he have set H7760 (8799) judgment H4941 in the earth H0776: and the isles H0339 shall wait H3176 (8762) for his law H8451.
042:005 Thus saith H0559 (8804) God H0410 the LORD H3068, he that created H1254 (8802) the heavens H8064, and stretched them out H5186 (8802); he that spread forth H7554 (8802) the earth H0776, and that which cometh out H6631 of it; he that giveth H5414 (8802) breath H5397 unto the people H5971 upon it, and spirit H7307 to them that walk H1980 (8802) therein:
042:006 I the LORD H3068 have called H7121 (8804) thee in righteousness H6664, and will hold H2388 (8686) thine hand H3027, and will keep H5341 (8799) thee, and give H5414 (8799) thee for a covenant H1285 of the people H5971, for a light H0216 of the Gentiles H1471;
042:007 To open H6491 (8800) the blind H5787 eyes H5869, to bring out H3318 (8687) the prisoners H0616 from the prison H4525, [and] them that sit H3427 (8802) in darkness H2822 out of the prison H3608 house H1004.
042:008 I [am] the LORD H3068: that [is] my name H8034: and my glory H3519 will I not give H5414 (8799) to another H0312, neither my praise H8416 to graven images H6456.
042:009 Behold, the former things H7223 are come to pass H0935 (8804), and new things H2319 do I declare H5046 (8688): before they spring forth H6779 (8799) I tell H8085 (8686) you of them.
042:010 Sing H7891 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 a new H2319 song H7892, [and] his praise H8416 from the end H7097 of the earth H0776, ye that go down H3381 (8802) to the sea H3220, and all that is therein H4393; the isles H0339, and the inhabitants H3427 (8802) thereof.
042:011 Let the wilderness H4057 and the cities H5892 thereof lift up H5375 (8799) [their voice], the villages H2691 [that] Kedar H6938 doth inhabit H3427 (8799): let the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the rock H5553 sing H7442 (8799), let them shout H6681 (8799) from the top H7218 of the mountains H2022.
042:012 Let them give H7760 (8799) glory H3519 unto the LORD H3068, and declare H5046 (8686) his praise H8416 in the islands H0339.
042:013 The LORD H3068 shall go forth H3318 (8799) as a mighty man H1368, he shall stir up H5782 (8686) jealousy H7068 like a man H0376 of war H4421: he shall cry H7321 (8686), yea, roar H6873 (8686); he shall prevail H1396 (8691) against his enemies H0341 (8802).
042:014 I have long time H5769 holden my peace H2814 (8689); I have been still H2790 (8686), [and] refrained H0662 (8691) myself: [now] will I cry H6463 (8799) like a travailing woman H3205 (8802); I will destroy H5395 (8799) (8676) H8074 (8799) and devour H7602 (8799) at once H3162.
042:015 I will make waste H2717 (8686) mountains H2022 and hills H1389, and dry up H3001 (8686) all their herbs H6212; and I will make H7760 (8804) the rivers H5104 islands H0339, and I will dry up H3001 (8686) the pools H0098.
042:016 And I will bring H3212 (8689) the blind H5787 by a way H1870 [that] they knew H3045 (8804) not; I will lead H1869 (8686) them in paths H5410 [that] they have not known H3045 (8804): I will make H7760 (8799) darkness H4285 light H0216 before H6440 them, and crooked things H4625 straight H4334. These things H1697 will I do H6213 (8804) unto them, and not forsake H5800 (8804) them.
042:017 They shall be turned H5472 (8738) back H0268, they shall be greatly H1322 ashamed H0954 (8799), that trust H0982 (8802) in graven images H6459, that say H0559 (8802) to the molten images H4541, Ye [are] our gods H0430.
042:018 Hear H8085 (8798), ye deaf H2795; and look H5027 (8685), ye blind H5787, that ye may see H7200 (8800).
042:019 Who [is] blind H5787, but my servant H5650? or deaf H2795, as my messenger H4397 [that] I sent H7971 (8799)? who [is] blind H5787 as [he that is] perfect H7999 (8794), and blind H5787 as the LORD’S H3068 servant H5650?
042:020 Seeing H7200 (8800) (8675) H7200 (8804) many things H7227, but thou observest H8104 (8799) not; opening H6491 (8800) the ears H0241, but he heareth H8085 (8799) not.
042:021 The LORD H3068 is well pleased H2654 (8804) for his righteousness H6664 ’ sake; he will magnify H1431 (8686) the law H8451, and make [it] honourable H0142 (8686).
042:022 But this [is] a people H5971 robbed H0962 (8803) and spoiled H8154 (8803); [they are] all of them snared H6351 (8687) in holes H2352 (8676) H0970, and they are hid H2244 (8717) in prison H3608 houses H1004: they are for a prey H0957, and none delivereth H5337 (8688); for a spoil H4933, and none saith H0559 (8802), Restore H7725 (8685).
042:023 Who among you will give ear H0238 (8686) to this? [who] will hearken H7181 (8686) and hear H8085 (8799) for the time to come H0268?
042:024 Who gave H5414 (8804) Jacob H3290 for a spoil H4933 (8675) H4882, and Israel H3478 to the robbers H0962 (8802)? did not the LORD H3068, he against whom H2098 we have sinned H2398 (8804)? for they would H0014 (8804) not walk H1980 (8800) in his ways H1870, neither were they obedient H8085 (8804) unto his law H8451.
042:025 Therefore he hath poured H8210 (8799) upon him the fury H2534 of his anger H0639, and the strength H5807 of battle H4421: and it hath set him on fire H3857 (8762) round about H5439, yet he knew H3045 (8804) not; and it burned H1197 (8799) him, yet he laid H7760 (8799) [it] not to heart H3820.
043:001 ¶  But now thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 that created H1254 (8802) thee, O Jacob H3290, and he that formed H3335 (8802) thee, O Israel H3478, Fear H3372 (8799) not: for I have redeemed H1350 (8804) thee, I have called H7121 (8804) [thee] by thy name H8034; thou [art] mine.
043:002 When thou passest through H5674 (8799) the waters H4325, I [will be] with thee; and through the rivers H5104, they shall not overflow H7857 (8799) thee: when thou walkest H3212 (8799) through H1119 the fire H0784, thou shalt not be burned H3554 (8735); neither shall the flame H3852 kindle H1197 (8799) upon thee.
043:003 For I [am] the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478, thy Saviour H3467 (8688): I gave H5414 (8804) Egypt H4714 [for] thy ransom H3724, Ethiopia H3568 and Seba H5434 for thee.
043:004 Since thou wast precious H3365 (8804) in my sight H5869, thou hast been honourable H3513 (8738), and I have loved H0157 (8804) thee: therefore will I give H5414 (8799) men H0120 for thee, and people H3816 for thy life H5315.
043:005 Fear H3372 (8799) not: for I [am] with thee: I will bring H0935 (8686) thy seed H2233 from the east H4217, and gather H6908 (8762) thee from the west H4628;
043:006 I will say H0559 (8799) to the north H6828, Give up H5414 (8798); and to the south H8486, Keep not back H3607 (8799): bring H0935 (8685) my sons H1121 from far H7350, and my daughters H1323 from the ends H7097 of the earth H0776;
043:007 [Even] every one H3605 that is called H7121 (8737) by my name H8034: for I have created H1254 (8804) him for my glory H3519, I have formed H3335 (8804) him; yea, I have made H6213 (8804) him.
043:008 Bring forth H3318 (8685) the blind H5787 people H5971 that have H3426 eyes H5869, and the deaf H2795 that have ears H0241.
043:009 Let all the nations H1471 be gathered H6908 (8738) together H3162, and let the people H3816 be assembled H0622 (8735): who among them can declare H5046 (8686) this, and shew H8085 (8686) us former things H7223? let them bring forth H5414 (8799) their witnesses H5707, that they may be justified H6663 (8799): or let them hear H8085 (8799), and say H0559 (8799), [It is] truth H0571.
043:010 Ye [are] my witnesses H5707, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, and my servant H5650 whom I have chosen H0977 (8804): that ye may know H3045 (8799) and believe H0539 (8686) me, and understand H0995 (8799) that I [am] he: before H6440 me there was no God H0410 formed H3335 (8738), neither shall there be after H0310 me.
043:011 I, [even] I, [am] the LORD H3068; and beside H1107 me [there is] no saviour H3467 (8688).
043:012 I have declared H5046 (8689), and have saved H3467 (8689), and I have shewed H8085 (8689), when [there was] no strange H2114 (8801) [god] among you: therefore ye [are] my witnesses H5707, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that I [am] God H0410.
043:013 Yea, before the day H3117 [was] I [am] he; and [there is] none that can deliver H5337 (8688) out of my hand H3027: I will work H6466 (8799), and who shall let H7725 (8686) it?
043:014 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, your redeemer H1350 (8802), the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478; For your sake I have sent H7971 (8765) to Babylon H0894, and have brought down H3381 (8689) all their nobles H1281, and the Chaldeans H3778, whose cry H7440 [is] in the ships H0591.
043:015 I [am] the LORD H3068, your Holy One H6918, the creator H1254 (8802) of Israel H3478, your King H4428.
043:016 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, which maketh H5414 (8802) a way H1870 in the sea H3220, and a path H5410 in the mighty H5794 waters H4325;
043:017 Which bringeth forth H3318 (8688) the chariot H7393 and horse H5483, the army H2428 and the power H5808; they shall lie down H7901 (8799) together H3162, they shall not rise H6965 (8799): they are extinct H1846 (8804), they are quenched H3518 (8804) as tow H6594.
043:018 Remember H2142 (8799) ye not the former things H7223, neither consider H0995 (8709) the things of old H6931.
043:019 Behold, I will do H6213 (8802) a new thing H2319; now it shall spring forth H6779 (8799); shall ye not know H3045 (8799) it? I will even make H7760 (8799) a way H1870 in the wilderness H4057, [and] rivers H5104 in the desert H3452.
043:020 The beast H2416 of the field H7704 shall honour H3513 (8762) me, the dragons H8577 and the owls H1323 H3284: because I give H5414 (8804) waters H4325 in the wilderness H4057, [and] rivers H5104 in the desert H3452, to give drink H8248 (8687) to my people H5971, my chosen H0972.
043:021 This H2098 people H5971 have I formed H3335 (8804) for myself; they shall shew forth H5608 (8762) my praise H8416.
043:022 But thou hast not called H7121 (8804) upon me, O Jacob H3290; but thou hast been weary H3021 (8804) of me, O Israel H3478.
043:023 Thou hast not brought H0935 (8689) me the small cattle H7716 of thy burnt offerings H5930; neither hast thou honoured H3513 (8765) me with thy sacrifices H2077. I have not caused thee to serve H5647 (8689) with an offering H4503, nor wearied H3021 (8689) thee with incense H3828.
043:024 Thou hast bought H7069 (8804) me no sweet cane H7070 with money H3701, neither hast thou filled H7301 (8689) me with the fat H2459 of thy sacrifices H2077: but thou hast made me to serve H5647 (8689) with thy sins H2403, thou hast wearied H3021 (8689) me with thine iniquities H5771.
043:025 I, [even] I, [am] he that blotteth out H4229 (8802) thy transgressions H6588 for mine own sake, and will not remember H2142 (8799) thy sins H2403.
043:026 Put me in remembrance H2142 (8685): let us plead H8199 (8735) together H3162: declare H5608 (8761) thou, that thou mayest be justified H6663 (8799).
043:027 Thy first H7223 father H0001 hath sinned H2398 (8804), and thy teachers H3887 (8688) have transgressed H6586 (8804) against me.
043:028 Therefore I have profaned H2490 (8762) the princes H8269 of the sanctuary H6944, and have given H5414 (8799) Jacob H3290 to the curse H2764, and Israel H3478 to reproaches H1421.
044:001 ¶  Yet now hear H8085 (8798), O Jacob H3290 my servant H5650; and Israel H3478, whom I have chosen H0977 (8804):
044:002 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 that made H6213 (8802) thee, and formed H3335 (8802) thee from the womb H0990, [which] will help H5826 (8799) thee; Fear H3372 (8799) not, O Jacob H3290, my servant H5650; and thou, Jesurun H3484, whom I have chosen H0977 (8804).
044:003 For I will pour H3332 (8799) water H4325 upon him that is thirsty H6771, and floods H5140 (8802) upon the dry ground H3004: I will pour H3332 (8799) my spirit H7307 upon thy seed H2233, and my blessing H1293 upon thine offspring H6631:
044:004 And they shall spring up H6779 (8804) [as] among H0996 the grass H2682, as willows H6155 by the water H4325 courses H2988.
044:005 One shall say H0559 (8799), I [am] the LORD’S H3068; and another shall call H7121 (8799) [himself] by the name H8034 of Jacob H3290; and another shall subscribe H3789 (8799) [with] his hand H3027 unto the LORD H3068, and surname H3655 (8762) [himself] by the name H8034 of Israel H3478.
044:006 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 the King H4428 of Israel H3478, and his redeemer H1350 (8802) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635; I [am] the first H7223, and I [am] the last H0314; and beside H1107 me [there is] no God H0430.
044:007 And who, as I, shall call H7121 (8799), and shall declare H5046 (8686) it, and set it in order H6186 (8799) for me, since I appointed H7760 (8800) the ancient H5769 people H5971? and the things that are coming H0857 (8802), and shall come H0935 (8799), let them shew H5046 (8686) unto them.
044:008 Fear H6342 (8799) ye not, neither be afraid H7297 (8799) (8676) H7297 (8804): have not I told H8085 (8689) thee from that time H0227, and have declared H5046 (8689) [it]? ye [are] even my witnesses H5707. Is there H3426 a God H0433 beside H1107 me? yea, [there is] no God H6697; I know H3045 (8804) not [any].
044:009 They that make H3335 (8802) a graven image H6459 [are] all of them vanity H8414; and their delectable things H2530 (8803) shall not profit H3276 (8686); and they [are] their own witnesses H5707; they see H7200 (8799) not, nor know H3045 (8799); that they may be ashamed H0954 (8799).
044:010 Who hath formed H3335 (8804) a god H0410, or molten H5258 (8804) a graven image H6459 [that] is profitable H3276 (8687) for nothing H1115?
044:011 Behold, all his fellows H2270 shall be ashamed H0954 (8799): and the workmen H2796, they [are] of men H0120: let them all be gathered together H6908 (8691), let them stand up H5975 (8799); [yet] they shall fear H6342 (8799), [and] they shall be ashamed H0954 (8799) together H3162.
044:012 The smith H1270 H2796 with the tongs H4621 both worketh H6466 (8804) in the coals H6352, and fashioneth H3335 (8799) it with hammers H4717, and worketh H6466 (8799) it with the strength H3581 of his arms H2220: yea, he is hungry H7457, and his strength H3581 faileth H0369: he drinketh H8354 (8804) no water H4325, and is faint H3286 (8799).
044:013 The carpenter H2796 H6086 stretcheth out H5186 (8804) [his] rule H6957; he marketh it out H8388 (8762) with a line H8279; he fitteth H6213 (8799) it with planes H4741, and he marketh it out H8388 (8762) with the compass H4230, and maketh H6213 (8799) it after the figure H8403 of a man H0376, according to the beauty H8597 of a man H0120; that it may remain H3427 (8800) in the house H1004.
044:014 He heweth him down H3772 (8800) cedars H0730, and taketh H3947 (8799) the cypress H8645 and the oak H0437, which he strengtheneth H0553 (8762) for himself among the trees H6086 of the forest H3293: he planteth H5193 (8804) an ash H0766, and the rain H1653 doth nourish H1431 (8762) [it].
044:015 Then shall it be for a man H0120 to burn H1197 (8763): for he will take H3947 (8799) thereof, and warm H2552 (8799) himself; yea, he kindleth H5400 (8686) [it], and baketh H0644 (8804) bread H3899; yea, he maketh H6466 (8799) a god H0410, and worshippeth H7812 (8691) [it]; he maketh H6213 (8804) it a graven image H6459, and falleth down H5456 (8799) thereto.
044:016 He burneth H8313 (8804) part H2677 thereof in H1119 the fire H0784; with part H2677 thereof he eateth H0398 (8799) flesh H1320; he roasteth H6740 (8799) roast H6748, and is satisfied H7646 (8799): yea, he warmeth H2552 (8799) [himself], and saith H0559 (8799), Aha H1889, I am warm H2552 (8804), I have seen H7200 (8804) the fire H0217:
044:017 And the residue H7611 thereof he maketh H6213 (8804) a god H0410, [even] his graven image H6459: he falleth down H5456 (8799) unto it, and worshippeth H7812 (8691) [it], and prayeth H6419 (8691) unto it, and saith H0559 (8799), Deliver H5337 (8685) me; for thou [art] my god H0410.
044:018 They have not known H3045 (8804) nor understood H0995 (8799): for he hath shut H2902 (8804) their eyes H5869, that they cannot see H7200 (8800); [and] their hearts H3826, that they cannot understand H7919 (8687).
044:019 And none considereth H7725 (8686) in his heart H3820, neither [is there] knowledge H1847 nor understanding H8394 to say H0559 (8800), I have burned H8313 (8804) part H2677 of it in H1119 the fire H0784; yea, also I have baked H0644 (8804) bread H3899 upon the coals H1513 thereof; I have roasted H6740 (8799) flesh H1320, and eaten H0398 (8799) [it]: and shall I make H6213 (8799) the residue H3499 thereof an abomination H8441? shall I fall down H5456 (8799) to the stock H0944 of a tree H6086?
044:020 He feedeth H7462 (8802) on ashes H0665: a deceived H2048 (8795) heart H3820 hath turned him aside H5186 (8689), that he cannot deliver H5337 (8686) his soul H5315, nor say H0559 (8799), [Is there] not a lie H8267 in my right hand H3225?
044:021 Remember H2142 (8798) these, O Jacob H3290 and Israel H3478; for thou [art] my servant H5650: I have formed H3335 (8804) thee; thou [art] my servant H5650: O Israel H3478, thou shalt not be forgotten H5382 (8735) of me.
044:022 I have blotted out H4229 (8804), as a thick cloud H5645, thy transgressions H6588, and, as a cloud H6051, thy sins H2403: return H7725 (8798) unto me; for I have redeemed H1350 (8804) thee.
044:023 Sing H7442 (8798), O ye heavens H8064; for the LORD H3068 hath done H6213 (8804) [it]: shout H7321 (8685), ye lower parts H8482 of the earth H0776: break forth H6476 (8798) into singing H7440, ye mountains H2022, O forest H3293, and every tree H6086 therein: for the LORD H3068 hath redeemed H1350 (8804) Jacob H3290, and glorified H6286 (8691) himself in Israel H3478.
044:024 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, thy redeemer H1350 (8802), and he that formed H3335 (8802) thee from the womb H0990, I [am] the LORD H3068 that maketh H6213 (8802) all [things]; that stretcheth forth H5186 (8802) the heavens H8064 alone; that spreadeth abroad H7554 (8802) the earth H0776 by myself;
044:025 That frustrateth H6565 (8688) the tokens H0226 of the liars H0907, and maketh diviners H7080 (8802) mad H1984 (8779); that turneth H7725 (8688) wise H2450 [men] backward H0268, and maketh their knowledge H1847 foolish H5528 (8762);
044:026 That confirmeth H6965 (8688) the word H1697 of his servant H5650, and performeth H7999 (8686) the counsel H6098 of his messengers H4397; that saith H0559 (8802) to Jerusalem H3389, Thou shalt be inhabited H3427 (8714); and to the cities H5892 of Judah H3063, Ye shall be built H1129 (8735), and I will raise up H6965 (8787) the decayed places H2723 thereof:
044:027 That saith H0559 (8802) to the deep H6683, Be dry H2717 (8798), and I will dry up H3001 (8686) thy rivers H5104:
044:028 That saith H0559 (8802) of Cyrus H3566, [He is] my shepherd H7462 (8802), and shall perform H7999 (8686) all my pleasure H2656: even saying H0559 (8800) to Jerusalem H3389, Thou shalt be built H1129 (8735); and to the temple H1964, Thy foundation shall be laid H3245 (8735).
045:001 ¶  Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 to his anointed H4899, to Cyrus H3566, whose right hand H3225 I have holden H2388 (8689), to subdue H7286 (8800) nations H1471 before H6440 him; and I will loose H6605 (8762) the loins H4975 of kings H4428, to open H6605 (8800) before H6440 him the two leaved gates H1817; and the gates H8179 shall not be shut H5462 (8735);
045:002 I will go H3212 (8799) before H6440 thee, and make H3474 the crooked places H1921 (8803) straight H3474 (8762) (8675) H3474 (8686): I will break in pieces H7665 (8762) the gates H1817 of brass H5154, and cut in sunder H1438 (8762) the bars H1280 of iron H1270:
045:003 And I will give H5414 (8804) thee the treasures H0214 of darkness H2822, and hidden riches H4301 of secret places H4565, that thou mayest know H3045 (8799) that I, the LORD H3068, which call H7121 (8802) [thee] by thy name H8034, [am] the God H0430 of Israel H3478.
045:004 For Jacob H3290 my servant’s H5650 sake, and Israel H3478 mine elect H0972, I have even called H7121 (8799) thee by thy name H8034: I have surnamed H3655 (8762) thee, though thou hast not known H3045 (8804) me.
045:005 I [am] the LORD H3068, and [there is] none else, [there is] no God H0430 beside H2108 me: I girded H0247 (8762) thee, though thou hast not known H3045 (8804) me:
045:006 That they may know H3045 (8799) from the rising H4217 of the sun H8121, and from the west H4628, that [there is] none H0657 beside H1107 me. I [am] the LORD H3068, and [there is] none else.
045:007 I form H3335 (8802) the light H0216, and create H1254 (8802) darkness H2822: I make H6213 (8802) peace H7965, and create H1254 (8802) evil H7451: I the LORD H3068 do H6213 (8802) all these [things].
045:008 Drop down H7491 (8685), ye heavens H8064, from above H4605, and let the skies H7834 pour down H5140 (8799) righteousness H6664: let the earth H0776 open H6605 (8799), and let them bring forth H6509 (8799) salvation H3468, and let righteousness H6666 spring up H6779 (8686) together H3162; I the LORD H3068 have created H1254 (8804) it.
045:009 Woe H1945 unto him that striveth H7378 (8801) with his Maker H3335 (8802)! [Let] the potsherd H2789 [strive] with the potsherds H2789 of the earth H0127. Shall the clay H2563 say H0559 (8799) to him that fashioneth H3335 (8802) it, What makest H6213 (8799) thou? or thy work H6467, He hath no hands H3027?
045:010 Woe H1945 unto him that saith H0559 (8802) unto [his] father H0001, What begettest H3205 (8686) thou? or to the woman H0802, What hast thou brought forth H2342 (8799)?
045:011 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478, and his Maker H3335 (8802), Ask H7592 (8798) me of things to come H0857 (8802) concerning my sons H1121, and concerning the work H6467 of my hands H3027 command H6680 (8762) ye me.
045:012 I have made H6213 (8804) the earth H0776, and created H1254 (8804) man H0120 upon it: I, [even] my hands H3027, have stretched out H5186 (8804) the heavens H8064, and all their host H6635 have I commanded H6680 (8765).
045:013 I have raised him up H5782 (8689) in righteousness H6664, and I will direct H3474 (8762) all his ways H1870: he shall build H1129 (8799) my city H5892, and he shall let go H7971 (8762) my captives H1546, not for price H4242 nor reward H7810, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635.
045:014 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, The labour H3018 of Egypt H4714, and merchandise H5505 of Ethiopia H3568 and of the Sabeans H5436, men H0582 of stature H4060, shall come over H5674 (8799) unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come H3212 (8799) after H0310 thee; in chains H2131 they shall come over H5674 (8799), and they shall fall down H7812 (8691) unto thee, they shall make supplication H6419 (8691) unto thee, [saying], Surely God H0410 [is] in thee; and [there is] none else, [there is] no H0657 God H0430.
045:015 Verily H0403 thou [art] a God H0410 that hidest H5641 (8693) thyself, O God H0430 of Israel H3478, the Saviour H3467 (8688).
045:016 They shall be ashamed H0954 (8804), and also confounded H3637 (8738), all of them: they shall go H1980 (8804) to confusion H3639 together H3162 [that are] makers H2796 of idols H6736.
045:017 [But] Israel H3478 shall be saved H3467 (8738) in the LORD H3068 with an everlasting H5769 salvation H8668: ye shall not be ashamed H0954 (8799) nor confounded H3637 (8735) world H5769 without end H5703.
045:018 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 that created H1254 (8802) the heavens H8064; God H0430 himself that formed H3335 (8802) the earth H0776 and made H6213 (8802) it; he hath established H3559 (8790) it, he created H1254 (8804) it not in vain H8414, he formed H3335 (8804) it to be inhabited H3427 (8800): I [am] the LORD H3068; and [there is] none else.
045:019 I have not spoken H1696 (8765) in secret H5643, in a dark H2822 place H4725 of the earth H0776: I said H0559 (8804) not unto the seed H2233 of Jacob H3290, Seek H1245 (8761) ye me in vain H8414: I the LORD H3068 speak H1696 (8802) righteousness H6664, I declare H5046 (8688) things that are right H4339.
045:020 Assemble H6908 (8734) yourselves and come H0935 (8798); draw near H5066 (8690) together H3162, ye [that are] escaped H6412 of the nations H1471: they have no knowledge H3045 (8804) that set up H5375 (8802) the wood H6086 of their graven image H6459, and pray H6419 (8693) unto a god H0410 [that] cannot save H3467 (8686).
045:021 Tell H5046 (8685) ye, and bring [them] near H5066 (8685); yea, let them take counsel H3289 (8735) together H3162: who hath declared H8085 (8689) this from ancient time H6924? [who] hath told H5046 (8689) it from that time? [have] not I the LORD H3068? and [there is] no God H0430 else beside H1107 me; a just H6662 God H0410 and a Saviour H3467 (8688); [there is] none H0369 beside H2108 me.
045:022 Look H6437 (8798) unto me, and be ye saved H3467 (8734), all the ends H0657 of the earth H0776: for I [am] God H0410, and [there is] none else.
045:023 I have sworn H7650 (8738) by myself, the word H1697 is gone out H3318 (8804) of my mouth H6310 [in] righteousness H6666, and shall not return H7725 (8799), That unto me every knee H1290 shall bow H3766 (8799), every tongue H3956 shall swear H7650 (8735).
045:024 Surely, shall [one] say H0559 (8804), in the LORD H3068 have I righteousness H6666 and strength H5797: [even] to him shall [men] come H0935 (8799); and all that are incensed H2734 (8737) against him shall be ashamed H0954 (8799).
045:025 In the LORD H3068 shall all the seed H2233 of Israel H3478 be justified H6663 (8799), and shall glory H1984 (8691).
046:001 ¶  Bel H1078 boweth down H3766 (8804), Nebo H5015 stoopeth H7164 (8802), their idols H6091 were upon the beasts H2416, and upon the cattle H0929: your carriages H5385 [were] heavy loaden H6006 (8803); [they are] a burden H4853 to the weary H5889 [beast].
046:002 They stoop H7164 (8804), they bow down H3766 (8804) together H3162; they could H3201 (8804) not deliver H4422 (8763) the burden H4853, but themselves H5315 are gone H1980 (8804) into captivity H7628.
046:003 Hearken H8085 (8798) unto me, O house H1004 of Jacob H3290, and all the remnant H7611 of the house H1004 of Israel H3478, which are borne H6006 (8803) [by me] from the belly H0990, which are carried H5375 (8803) from the womb H7356:
046:004 And [even] to [your] old age H2209 I [am] he; and [even] to hoar hairs H7872 will I carry H5445 (8799) [you]: I have made H6213 (8804), and I will bear H5375 (8799); even I will carry H5445 (8799), and will deliver H4422 (8762) [you].
046:005 To whom will ye liken H1819 (8762) me, and make [me] equal H7737 (8686), and compare H4911 (8686) me, that we may be like H1819 (8799)?
046:006 They lavish H2107 (8801) gold H2091 out of the bag H3599, and weigh H8254 (8799) silver H3701 in the balance H7070, [and] hire H7936 (8799) a goldsmith H6884 (8802); and he maketh H6213 (8799) it a god H0410: they fall down H5456 (8799), yea, they worship H7812 (8691).
046:007 They bear H5375 (8799) him upon the shoulder H3802, they carry H5445 (8799) him, and set him in his place H3240 (8686), and he standeth H5975 (8799); from his place H4725 shall he not remove H4185 (8686): yea, [one] shall cry H6817 (8799) unto him, yet can he not answer H6030 (8799), nor save H3467 (8686) him out of his trouble H6869.
046:008 Remember H2142 (8798) this, and shew yourselves men H0377 (8695): bring [it] again H7725 (8685) to mind H3820, O ye transgressors H6586 (8802).
046:009 Remember H2142 (8798) the former things H7223 of old H5769: for I [am] God H0410, and [there is] none else; [I am] God H0430, and [there is] none H0657 like H3644 me,
046:010 Declaring H5046 (8688) the end H0319 from the beginning H7225, and from ancient times H6924 [the things] that are not [yet] done H6213 (8738), saying H0559 (8802), My counsel H6098 shall stand H6965 (8799), and I will do H6213 (8799) all my pleasure H2656:
046:011 Calling H7121 (8802) a ravenous bird H5861 from the east H4217, the man H0376 that executeth my counsel H6098 from a far H4801 country H0776: yea, I have spoken H1696 (8765) [it], I will also bring H0935 (8686) it to pass; I have purposed H3335 (8804) [it], I will also do H6213 (8799) it.
046:012 Hearken H8085 (8798) unto me, ye stouthearted H0047 H3820, that [are] far from H7350 righteousness H6666:
046:013 I bring near H7126 (8765) my righteousness H6666; it shall not be far off H7368 (8799), and my salvation H8668 shall not tarry H0309 (8762): and I will place H5414 (8804) salvation H8668 in Zion H6726 for Israel H3478 my glory H8597.
047:001 ¶  Come down H3381 (8798), and sit H3427 (8798) in the dust H6083, O virgin H1330 daughter H1323 of Babylon H0894, sit H3427 (8798) on the ground H0776: [there is] no throne H3678, O daughter H1323 of the Chaldeans H3778: for thou shalt no more H3254 (8686) be called H7121 (8799) tender H7390 and delicate H6028.
047:002 Take H3947 (8798) the millstones H7347, and grind H2912 (8798) meal H7058: uncover H1540 (8761) thy locks H6777, make bare H2834 (8798) the leg H7640, uncover H1540 (8761) the thigh H7785, pass over H5674 (8798) the rivers H5104.
047:003 Thy nakedness H6172 shall be uncovered H1540 (8735), yea, thy shame H2781 shall be seen H7200 (8735): I will take H3947 (8799) vengeance H5359, and I will not meet H6293 (8799) [thee as] a man H0120.
047:004 [As for] our redeemer H1350 (8802), the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] his name H8034, the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
047:005 Sit H3427 (8798) thou silent H1748, and get H0935 (8798) thee into darkness H2822, O daughter H1323 of the Chaldeans H3778: for thou shalt no more H3254 (8686) be called H7121 (8799), The lady H1404 of kingdoms H4467.
047:006 I was wroth H7107 (8804) with my people H5971, I have polluted H2490 (8765) mine inheritance H5159, and given H5414 (8799) them into thine hand H3027: thou didst shew H7760 (8804) them no mercy H7356; upon the ancient H2205 hast thou very H3966 heavily H3513 (8689) laid thy yoke H5923.
047:007 And thou saidst H0559 (8799), I shall be a lady H1404 for ever H5769: [so] that thou didst not lay H7760 (8804) these [things] to thy heart H3820, neither didst remember H2142 (8804) the latter end H0319 of it.
047:008 Therefore hear H8085 (8798) now this, [thou that art] given to pleasures H5719, that dwellest H3427 (8802) carelessly H0983, that sayest H0559 (8802) in thine heart H3824, I [am], and none else H0657 beside me; I shall not sit H3427 (8799) [as] a widow H0490, neither shall I know H3045 (8799) the loss of children H7908:
047:009 But these two H8147 [things] shall come H0935 (8799) to thee in a moment H7281 in one H0259 day H3117, the loss of children H7908, and widowhood H0489: they shall come H0935 (8804) upon thee in their perfection H8537 for the multitude H7230 of thy sorceries H3785, [and] for the great H3966 abundance H6109 of thine enchantments H2267.
047:010 For thou hast trusted H0982 (8799) in thy wickedness H7451: thou hast said H0559 (8804), None seeth H7200 (8802) me. Thy wisdom H2451 and thy knowledge H1847, it hath perverted H7725 (8790) thee; and thou hast said H0559 (8799) in thine heart H3820, I [am], and none else H0657 beside me.
047:011 Therefore shall evil H7451 come H0935 (8804) upon thee; thou shalt not know H3045 (8799) from whence it riseth H7837: and mischief H1943 shall fall H5307 (8799) upon thee; thou shalt not be able H3201 (8799) to put it off H3722 (8763): and desolation H7722 shall come H0935 (8799) upon thee suddenly H6597, [which] thou shalt not know H3045 (8799).
047:012 Stand H5975 (8798) now with thine enchantments H2267, and with the multitude H7230 of thy sorceries H3785, wherein H0834 thou hast laboured H3021 (8804) from thy youth H5271; if so be thou shalt be able H3201 (8799) to profit H3276 (8687), if so be thou mayest prevail H6206 (8799).
047:013 Thou art wearied H3811 (8738) in the multitude H7230 of thy counsels H6098. Let now the astrologers H1895 (8802) H8064, the stargazers H2374 H3556, the monthly H2320 prognosticators H3045 (8688), stand up H5975 (8799), and save H3467 (8686) thee from [these things] that shall come H0935 (8799) upon thee.
047:014 Behold, they shall be as stubble H7179; the fire H0784 shall burn H8313 (8804) them; they shall not deliver H5337 (8686) themselves H5315 from the power H3027 of the flame H3852: [there shall] not [be] a coal H1513 to warm H2552 (8800) at, [nor] fire H0217 to sit H3427 (8800) before it.
047:015 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured H3021 (8804), [even] thy merchants H5503 (8802), from thy youth H5271: they shall wander H8582 (8804) every one H0376 to his quarter H5676; none shall save H3467 (8688) thee.
048:001 ¶  Hear H8085 (8798) ye this, O house H1004 of Jacob H3290, which are called H7121 (8737) by the name H8034 of Israel H3478, and are come forth H3318 (8804) out of the waters H4325 of Judah H3063, which swear H7650 (8737) by the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, and make mention H2142 (8686) of the God H0430 of Israel H3478, [but] not in truth H0571, nor in righteousness H6666.
048:002 For they call H7121 (8738) themselves of the holy H6944 city H5892, and stay H5564 (8738) themselves upon the God H0430 of Israel H3478; The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] his name H8034.
048:003 I have declared H5046 (8689) the former things H7223 from the beginning H0227; and they went forth H3318 (8804) out of my mouth H6310, and I shewed H8085 (8686) them; I did H6213 (8804) [them] suddenly H6597, and they came to pass H0935 (8799).
048:004 Because I knew H1847 that thou [art] obstinate H7186, and thy neck H6203 [is] an iron H1270 sinew H1517, and thy brow H4696 brass H5154;
048:005 I have even from the beginning H0227 declared H5046 (8686) [it] to thee; before it came to pass H0935 (8799) I shewed H8085 (8689) [it] thee: lest thou shouldest say H0559 (8799), Mine idol H6090 hath done H6213 (8804) them, and my graven image H6459, and my molten image H5262, hath commanded H6680 (8765) them.
048:006 Thou hast heard H8085 (8804), see H2372 (8798) all this; and will not ye declare H5046 (8686) [it]? I have shewed H8085 (8689) thee new things H2319 from this time H6258, even hidden things H5341 (8803), and thou didst not know H3045 (8804) them.
048:007 They are created H1254 (8738) now, and not from the beginning; even before H6440 the day H3117 when thou heardest H8085 (8804) them not; lest thou shouldest say H0559 (8799), Behold, I knew H3045 (8804) them.
048:008 Yea, thou heardest H8085 (8804) not; yea, thou knewest H3045 (8804) not; yea, from that time [that] thine ear H0241 was not opened H6605 (8765): for I knew H3045 (8804) that thou wouldest deal very H0898 (8800) treacherously H0898 (8799), and wast called H7121 (8795) a transgressor H6586 (8802) from the womb H0990.
048:009 For my name’s H8034 sake will I defer H0748 (8686) mine anger H0639, and for my praise H8416 will I refrain H2413 (8799) for thee, that I cut thee not off H3772 (8687).
048:010 Behold, I have refined H6884 (8804) thee, but not with silver H3701; I have chosen H0977 (8804) thee in the furnace H3564 of affliction H6040.
048:011 For mine own sake, [even] for mine own sake, will I do H6213 (8799) [it]: for how should [my name] be polluted H2490 (8735)? and I will not give H5414 (8799) my glory H3519 unto another H0312.
048:012 Hearken H8085 (8798) unto me, O Jacob H3290 and Israel H3478, my called H7121 (8794); I [am] he; I [am] the first H7223, I also [am] the last H0314.
048:013 Mine hand H3027 also hath laid the foundation H3245 (8804) of the earth H0776, and my right hand H3225 hath spanned H2946 (8765) the heavens H8064: [when] I call H7121 (8802) unto them, they stand up H5975 (8799) together H3162.
048:014 All ye, assemble H6908 (8734) yourselves, and hear H8085 (8798); which among them hath declared H5046 (8689) these [things]? The LORD H3068 hath loved H0157 (8804) him: he will do H6213 (8799) his pleasure H2656 on Babylon H0894, and his arm H2220 [shall be on] the Chaldeans H3778.
048:015 I, [even] I, have spoken H1696 (8765); yea, I have called H7121 (8804) him: I have brought H0935 (8689) him, and he shall make his way H1870 prosperous H6743 (8689).
048:016 Come H7126 (8798) ye near H7126 (8798) unto me, hear H8085 (8798) ye this; I have not spoken H1696 (8765) in secret H5643 from the beginning H7218; from the time H6256 that it was, there [am] I: and now the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, and his Spirit H7307, hath sent H7971 (8804) me.
048:017 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, thy Redeemer H1350 (8802), the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478; I [am] the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 which teacheth H3925 (8764) thee to profit H3276 (8687), which leadeth H1869 (8688) thee by the way H1870 [that] thou shouldest go H3212 (8799).
048:018 O that H3863 thou hadst hearkened H7181 (8689) to my commandments H4687! then had thy peace H7965 been as a river H5104, and thy righteousness H6666 as the waves H1530 of the sea H3220:
048:019 Thy seed H2233 also had been as the sand H2344, and the offspring H6631 of thy bowels H4578 like the gravel H4579 thereof; his name H8034 should not have been cut off H3772 (8735) nor destroyed H8045 (8735) from before H6440 me.
048:020 Go ye forth H3318 (8798) of Babylon H0894, flee H1272 (8798) ye from the Chaldeans H3778, with a voice H6963 of singing H7440 declare H5046 (8685) ye, tell H8085 (8685) this, utter H3318 (8685) it [even] to the end H7097 of the earth H0776; say H0559 (8798) ye, The LORD H3068 hath redeemed H1350 (8804) his servant H5650 Jacob H3290.
048:021 And they thirsted H6770 (8804) not [when] he led H3212 (8689) them through the deserts H2723: he caused the waters H4325 to flow H5140 (8689) out of the rock H6697 for them: he clave H1234 (8799) the rock H6697 also, and the waters H4325 gushed out H2100 (8799).
048:022 [There is] no peace H7965, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, unto the wicked H7563.
049:001 ¶  Listen H8085 (8798), O isles H0339, unto me; and hearken H7181 (8685), ye people H3816, from far H7350; The LORD H3068 hath called H7121 (8804) me from the womb H0990; from the bowels H4578 of my mother H0517 hath he made mention H2142 (8689) of my name H8034.
049:002 And he hath made H7760 (8799) my mouth H6310 like a sharp H2299 sword H2719; in the shadow H6738 of his hand H3027 hath he hid H2244 (8689) me, and made H7760 (8799) me a polished H1305 (8803) shaft H2671; in his quiver H0827 hath he hid H5641 (8689) me;
049:003 And said H0559 (8799) unto me, Thou [art] my servant H5650, O Israel H3478, in whom I will be glorified H6286 (8691).
049:004 Then I said H0559 (8804), I have laboured H3021 (8804) in vain H7385, I have spent H3615 (8765) my strength H3581 for nought H8414, and in vain H1892: [yet] surely H0403 my judgment H4941 [is] with the LORD H3068, and my work H6468 with my God H0430.
049:005 And now, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 that formed H3335 (8802) me from the womb H0990 [to be] his servant H5650, to bring H7725 Jacob H3290 again H7725 (8788) to him, Though Israel H3478 be not gathered H0622 (8735), yet shall I be glorious H3513 (8735) in the eyes H5869 of the LORD H3068, and my God H0430 shall be my strength H5797.
049:006 And he said H0559 (8799), It is a light thing H7043 (8738) that thou shouldest be my servant H5650 to raise up H6965 (8687) the tribes H7626 of Jacob H3290, and to restore H7725 (8687) the preserved H5341 (8803) (8675) H5336 of Israel H3478: I will also give H5414 (8804) thee for a light H0216 to the Gentiles H1471, that thou mayest be my salvation H3444 unto the end H7097 of the earth H0776.
049:007 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, the Redeemer H1350 (8802) of Israel H3478, [and] his Holy One H6918, to him whom man H5315 despiseth H0960, to him whom the nation H1471 abhorreth H8581 (8764), to a servant H5650 of rulers H4910 (8802), Kings H4428 shall see H7200 (8799) and arise H6965 (8804), princes H8269 also shall worship H7812 (8691), because of the LORD H3068 that is faithful H0539 (8737), [and] the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478, and he shall choose H0977 (8799) thee.
049:008 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, In an acceptable H7522 time H6256 have I heard H6030 (8804) thee, and in a day H3117 of salvation H3444 have I helped H5826 (8804) thee: and I will preserve H5341 (8799) thee, and give H5414 (8799) thee for a covenant H1285 of the people H5971, to establish H6965 (8687) the earth H0776, to cause to inherit H5157 (8687) the desolate H8074 (8802) heritages H5159;
049:009 That thou mayest say H0559 (8800) to the prisoners H0631 (8803), Go forth H3318 (8798); to them that [are] in darkness H2822, Shew H1540 (8734) yourselves. They shall feed H7462 (8799) in the ways H1870, and their pastures H4830 [shall be] in all high places H8205.
049:010 They shall not hunger H7456 (8799) nor thirst H6770 (8799); neither shall the heat H8273 nor sun H8121 smite H5221 (8686) them: for he that hath mercy H7355 (8764) on them shall lead H5090 (8762) them, even by the springs H4002 of water H4325 shall he guide H5095 (8762) them.
049:011 And I will make H7760 (8804) all my mountains H2022 a way H1870, and my highways H4546 shall be exalted H7311 (8799).
049:012 Behold, these shall come H0935 (8799) from far H7350: and, lo, these from the north H6828 and from the west H3220; and these from the land H0776 of Sinim H5515.
049:013 Sing H7442 (8798), O heavens H8064; and be joyful H1523 (8798), O earth H0776; and break forth H6476 (8798) into singing H7440, O mountains H2022: for the LORD H3068 hath comforted H5162 (8765) his people H5971, and will have mercy H7355 (8762) upon his afflicted H6041.
049:014 But Zion H6726 said H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 hath forsaken H5800 (8804) me, and my Lord H0136 hath forgotten H7911 (8804) me.
049:015 Can a woman H0802 forget H7911 (8799) her sucking child H5764, that she should not have compassion H7355 (8763) on the son H1121 of her womb H0990? yea, they may forget H7911 (8799), yet will I not forget H7911 (8799) thee.
049:016 Behold, I have graven H2710 (8804) thee upon the palms of [my] hands H3709; thy walls H2346 [are] continually H8548 before me.
049:017 Thy children H1121 shall make haste H4116 (8765); thy destroyers H2040 (8764) and they that made thee waste H2717 (8688) shall go forth H3318 (8799) of thee.
049:018 Lift up H5375 (8798) thine eyes H5869 round about H5439, and behold H7200 (8798): all these gather themselves together H6908 (8738), [and] come H0935 (8804) to thee. [As] I live H2416, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, thou shalt surely clothe H3847 (8799) thee with them all, as with an ornament H5716, and bind H7194 (8762) them [on thee], as a bride H3618 [doeth].
049:019 For thy waste H2723 and thy desolate places H8074 (8802), and the land H0776 of thy destruction H2035, shall even now be too narrow H3334 (8799) by reason of the inhabitants H3427 (8802), and they that swallowed thee up H1104 (8764) shall be far away H7368 (8804).
049:020 The children H1121 which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost H7923 the other, shall say H0559 (8799) again in thine ears H0241, The place H4725 [is] too strait H6862 for me: give H5066 (8798) place H4725 to me that I may dwell H3427 (8799).
049:021 Then shalt thou say H0559 (8804) in thine heart H3824, Who hath begotten H3205 (8804) me these, seeing I have lost my children H7921 (8803), and am desolate H1565, a captive H1540 (8802), and removing to and fro H5493 (8803)? and who hath brought up H1431 (8765) these? Behold, I was left H7604 (8738) alone; these, where H0375 [had] they [been]?
049:022 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, Behold, I will lift up H5375 (8799) mine hand H3027 to the Gentiles H1471, and set up H7311 (8686) my standard H5251 to the people H5971: and they shall bring H0935 (8689) thy sons H1121 in [their] arms H2684, and thy daughters H1323 shall be carried H5375 (8735) upon [their] shoulders H3802.
049:023 And kings H4428 shall be thy nursing fathers H0539 (8802), and their queens H8282 thy nursing mothers H3243 (8688): they shall bow down H7812 (8691) to thee with [their] face H0639 toward the earth H0776, and lick up H3897 (8762) the dust H6083 of thy feet H7272; and thou shalt know H3045 (8804) that I [am] the LORD H3068: for they shall not be ashamed H0954 (8799) that wait H6960 (8802) for me.
049:024 Shall the prey H4455 be taken H3947 (8714) from the mighty H1368, or the lawful H6662 captive H7628 delivered H4422 (8735)?
049:025 But thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Even the captives H7628 of the mighty H1368 shall be taken away H3947 (8714), and the prey H4455 of the terrible H6184 shall be delivered H4422 (8735): for I will contend H7378 (8799) with him that contendeth H3401 with thee, and I will save H3467 (8686) thy children H1121.
049:026 And I will feed H0398 (8689) them that oppress H3238 (8688) thee with their own flesh H1320; and they shall be drunken H7937 (8799) with their own blood H1818, as with sweet wine H6071: and all flesh H1320 shall know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 [am] thy Saviour H3467 (8688) and thy Redeemer H1350 (8802), the mighty One H0046 of Jacob H3290.
050:001 ¶  Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Where [is] the bill H5612 of your mother’s H0517 divorcement H3748, whom I have put away H7971 (8765)? or which of my creditors H5383 (8802) [is it] to whom I have sold H4376 (8804) you? Behold, for your iniquities H5771 have ye sold H4376 (8738) yourselves, and for your transgressions H6588 is your mother H0517 put away H7971 (8795).
050:002 Wherefore, when I came H0935 (8804), [was there] no man H0376? when I called H7121 (8804), [was there] none to answer H6030 (8802)? Is my hand H3027 shortened H7114 (8804) at all H7114 (8800), that it cannot redeem H6304? or have I no power H3581 to deliver H5337 (8687)? behold, at my rebuke H1606 I dry up H2717 (8686) the sea H3220, I make H7760 (8799) the rivers H5104 a wilderness H4057: their fish H1710 stinketh H0887 (8799), because [there is] no water H4325, and dieth H4191 (8799) for thirst H6772.
050:003 I clothe H3847 (8686) the heavens H8064 with blackness H6940, and I make H7760 (8799) sackcloth H8242 their covering H3682.
050:004 The Lord H0136 GOD H3069 hath given H5414 (8804) me the tongue H3956 of the learned H3928, that I should know H3045 (8800) how to speak H5790 (8800) a word H1697 in season to [him that is] weary H3287: he wakeneth H5782 (8686) morning H1242 by morning H1242, he wakeneth H5782 (8686) mine ear H0241 to hear H8085 (8800) as the learned H3928.
050:005 The Lord H0136 GOD H3069 hath opened H6605 (8804) mine ear H0241, and I was not rebellious H4784 (8804), neither turned away H5472 (8738) back H0268.
050:006 I gave H5414 (8804) my back H1460 to the smiters H5221 (8688), and my cheeks H3895 to them that plucked off H4803 (8802) the hair: I hid H5641 (8689) not my face H6440 from shame H3639 and spitting H7536.
050:007 For the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 will help H5826 (8799) me; therefore shall I not be confounded H3637 (8738): therefore have I set H7760 (8804) my face H6440 like a flint H2496, and I know H3045 (8799) that I shall not be ashamed H0954 (8799).
050:008 [He is] near H7138 that justifieth H6663 (8688) me; who will contend H7378 (8799) with me? let us stand H5975 (8799) together H3162: who [is] mine adversary H1167 H4941? let him come near H5066 (8799) to me.
050:009 Behold, the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 will help H5826 (8799) me; who [is] he [that] shall condemn H7561 (8686) me? lo, they all shall wax old H1086 (8799) as a garment H0899; the moth H6211 shall eat them up H0398 (8799).
050:010 Who [is] among you that feareth H3373 the LORD H3068, that obeyeth H8085 (8802) the voice H6963 of his servant H5650, that walketh H1980 (8804) [in] darkness H2825, and hath no light H5051? let him trust H0982 (8799) in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, and stay H8172 (8735) upon his God H0430.
050:011 Behold, all ye that kindle H6919 (8802) a fire H0784, that compass [yourselves] about H0247 (8764) with sparks H2131: walk H3212 (8798) in the light H0217 of your fire H0784, and in the sparks H2131 [that] ye have kindled H1197 (8765). This shall ye have of mine hand H3027; ye shall lie down H7901 (8799) in sorrow H4620.
051:001 ¶  Hearken H8085 (8798) to me, ye that follow after H7291 (8802) righteousness H6664, ye that seek H1245 (8764) the LORD H3068: look H5027 (8685) unto the rock H6697 [whence] ye are hewn H2672 (8795), and to the hole H4718 of the pit H0953 [whence] ye are digged H5365 (8795).
051:002 Look H5027 (8685) unto Abraham H0085 your father H0001, and unto Sarah H8283 [that] bare H2342 (8787) you: for I called H7121 (8804) him alone H0259, and blessed H1288 (8762) him, and increased H7235 (8686) him.
051:003 For the LORD H3068 shall comfort H5162 (8765) Zion H6726: he will comfort H5162 (8765) all her waste places H2723; and he will make H7760 (8799) her wilderness H4057 like Eden H5731, and her desert H6160 like the garden H1588 of the LORD H3068; joy H8342 and gladness H8057 shall be found H4672 (8735) therein, thanksgiving H8426, and the voice H6963 of melody H2172.
051:004 Hearken H7181 (8685) unto me, my people H5971; and give ear H0238 (8685) unto me, O my nation H3816: for a law H8451 shall proceed H3318 (8799) from me, and I will make my judgment H4941 to rest H7280 (8686) for a light H0216 of the people H5971.
051:005 My righteousness H6664 [is] near H7138; my salvation H3468 is gone forth H3318 (8804), and mine arms H2220 shall judge H8199 (8799) the people H5971; the isles H0339 shall wait H6960 (8762) upon me, and on mine arm H2220 shall they trust H3176 (8762).
051:006 Lift up H5375 (8798) your eyes H5869 to the heavens H8064, and look H5027 (8685) upon the earth H0776 beneath: for the heavens H8064 shall vanish away H4414 (8738) like smoke H6227, and the earth H0776 shall wax old H1086 (8799) like a garment H0899, and they that dwell H3427 (8802) therein shall die H4191 (8799) in like H3644 manner H3654: but my salvation H3444 shall be for ever H5769, and my righteousness H6666 shall not be abolished H2865 (8735).
051:007 Hearken H8085 (8798) unto me, ye that know H3045 (8802) righteousness H6664, the people H5971 in whose heart H3820 [is] my law H8451; fear H3372 (8799) ye not the reproach H2781 of men H0582, neither be ye afraid H2865 (8735) of their revilings H1421.
051:008 For the moth H6211 shall eat them up H0398 (8799) like a garment H0899, and the worm H5580 shall eat H0398 (8799) them like wool H6785: but my righteousness H6666 shall be for ever H5769, and my salvation H3444 from generation H1755 to generation H1755.
051:009 Awake H5782 (8798), awake H5782 (8798), put on H3847 (8798) strength H5797, O arm H2220 of the LORD H3068; awake H5782 (8798), as in the ancient H6924 days H3117, in the generations H1755 of old H5769. [Art] thou not it that hath cut H2672 (8688) Rahab H7294, [and] wounded H2490 (8781) the dragon H8577?
051:010 [Art] thou not it which hath dried H2717 (8688) the sea H3220, the waters H4325 of the great H7227 deep H8415; that hath made H7760 (8804) the depths H4615 of the sea H3220 a way H1870 for the ransomed H1350 (8803) to pass over H5674 (8800)?
051:011 Therefore the redeemed H6299 (8803) of the LORD H3068 shall return H7725 (8799), and come H0935 (8804) with singing H7440 unto Zion H6726; and everlasting H5769 joy H8057 [shall be] upon their head H7218: they shall obtain H5381 (8686) gladness H8342 and joy H8057; [and] sorrow H3015 and mourning H0585 shall flee away H5127 (8804).
051:012 I, [even] I, [am] he that comforteth H5162 (8764) you: who [art] thou, that thou shouldest be afraid H3372 (8799) of a man H0582 [that] shall die H4191 (8799), and of the son H1121 of man H0120 [which] shall be made H5414 (8735) [as] grass H2682;
051:013 And forgettest H7911 (8799) the LORD H3068 thy maker H6213 (8802), that hath stretched forth H5186 (8802) the heavens H8064, and laid the foundations H3245 (8801) of the earth H0776; and hast feared H6342 (8762) continually H8548 every day H3117 because H6440 of the fury H2534 of the oppressor H6693 (8688), as if H0834 he were ready H3559 (8790) to destroy H7843 (8687)? and where [is] the fury H2534 of the oppressor H6693 (8688)?
051:014 The captive exile H6808 (8802) hasteneth H4116 (8765) that he may be loosed H6605 (8736), and that he should not die H4191 (8799) in the pit H7845, nor that his bread H3899 should fail H2637 (8799).
051:015 But I [am] the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, that divided H7280 (8802) the sea H3220, whose waves H1530 roared H1993 (8799): The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] his name H8034.
051:016 And I have put H7760 (8799) my words H1697 in thy mouth H6310, and I have covered H3680 (8765) thee in the shadow H6738 of mine hand H3027, that I may plant H5193 (8800) the heavens H8064, and lay the foundations H3245 (8800) of the earth H0776, and say H0559 (8800) unto Zion H6726, Thou [art] my people H5971.
051:017 Awake H5782 (8708), awake H5782 (8708), stand up H6965 (8798), O Jerusalem H3389, which hast drunk H8354 (8804) at the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 the cup H3563 of his fury H2534; thou hast drunken H8354 (8804) the dregs H6907 of the cup H3563 of trembling H8653, [and] wrung [them] out H4680 (8804).
051:018 [There is] none to guide H5095 (8764) her among all the sons H1121 [whom] she hath brought forth H3205 (8804); neither [is there any] that taketh H2388 (8688) her by the hand H3027 of all the sons H1121 [that] she hath brought up H1431 (8765).
051:019 These two H8147 [things] are come H7122 (8802) unto thee; who shall be sorry H5110 (8799) for thee? desolation H7701, and destruction H7667, and the famine H7458, and the sword H2719: by whom shall I comfort H5162 (8762) thee?
051:020 Thy sons H1121 have fainted H5968 (8795), they lie H7901 (8804) at the head H7218 of all the streets H2351, as a wild bull H8377 in a net H4364: they are full H4392 of the fury H2534 of the LORD H3068, the rebuke H1606 of thy God H0430.
051:021 Therefore hear H8085 (8798) now this, thou afflicted H6041, and drunken H7937 (8803), but not with wine H3196:
051:022 Thus saith H0559 (8804) thy Lord H0113 the LORD H3068, and thy God H0430 [that] pleadeth H7378 (8799) the cause of his people H5971, Behold, I have taken out H3947 (8804) of thine hand H3027 the cup H3563 of trembling H8653, [even] the dregs H6907 of the cup H3563 of my fury H2534; thou shalt no more H3254 (8686) drink it again H8354 (8800):
051:023 But I will put H7760 (8804) it into the hand H3027 of them that afflict H3013 (8688) thee; which have said H0559 (8804) to thy soul H5315, Bow down H7812 (8798), that we may go over H5674 (8799): and thou hast laid H7760 (8799) thy body H1460 as the ground H0776, and as the street H2351, to them that went over H5674 (8802).
052:001 ¶  Awake H5782 (8798), awake H5782 (8798); put on H3847 (8798) thy strength H5797, O Zion H6726; put on H3847 (8798) thy beautiful H8597 garments H0899, O Jerusalem H3389, the holy H6944 city H5892: for henceforth there shall no more H3254 (8686) come H0935 (8799) into thee the uncircumcised H6189 and the unclean H2931.
052:002 Shake H5287 (8690) thyself from the dust H6083; arise H6965 (8798), [and] sit down H3427 (8798), O Jerusalem H3389: loose H6605 (8690) thyself from the bands H4147 of thy neck H6677, O captive H7628 daughter H1323 of Zion H6726.
052:003 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Ye have sold H4376 (8738) yourselves for nought H2600; and ye shall be redeemed H1350 (8735) without money H3701.
052:004 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, My people H5971 went down H3381 (8804) aforetime H7223 into Egypt H4714 to sojourn H1481 (8800) there; and the Assyrian H0804 oppressed H6231 (8804) them without cause H0657.
052:005 Now therefore, what have I here, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, that my people H5971 is taken away H3947 (8795) for nought H2600? they that rule H4910 (8802) over them make them to howl H3213 (8686), saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068; and my name H8034 continually H8548 every day H3117 [is] blasphemed H5006 (8711).
052:006 Therefore my people H5971 shall know H3045 (8799) my name H8034: therefore [they shall know] in that day H3117 that I [am] he that doth speak H1696 (8764): behold, [it is] I.
052:007 How beautiful H4998 (8773) upon the mountains H2022 are the feet H7272 of him that bringeth good tidings H1319 (8764), that publisheth H8085 (8688) peace H7965; that bringeth good tidings H1319 (8764) of good H2896, that publisheth H8085 (8688) salvation H3444; that saith H0559 (8802) unto Zion H6726, Thy God H0430 reigneth H4427 (8804)!
052:008 Thy watchmen H6822 (8802) shall lift up H5375 (8804) the voice H6963; with the voice H6963 together H3162 shall they sing H7442 (8762): for they shall see H7200 (8799) eye H5869 to eye H5869, when the LORD H3068 shall bring again H7725 (8800) Zion H6726.
052:009 Break forth into joy H6476 (8798), sing H7442 (8761) together H3162, ye waste places H2723 of Jerusalem H3389: for the LORD H3068 hath comforted H5162 (8765) his people H5971, he hath redeemed H1350 (8804) Jerusalem H3389.
052:010 The LORD H3068 hath made bare H2834 (8804) his holy H6944 arm H2220 in the eyes H5869 of all the nations H1471; and all the ends H0657 of the earth H0776 shall see H7200 (8804) the salvation H3444 of our God H0430.
052:011 Depart H5493 (8798) ye, depart H5493 (8798) ye, go ye out H3318 (8798) from thence, touch H5060 (8799) no unclean H2931 [thing]; go ye out H3318 (8798) of the midst H8432 of her; be ye clean H1305 (8734), that bear H5375 (8802) the vessels H3627 of the LORD H3068.
052:012 For ye shall not go out H3318 (8799) with haste H2649, nor go H3212 (8799) by flight H4499: for the LORD H3068 will go H1980 (8802) before H6440 you; and the God H0430 of Israel H3478 [will be] your rereward H0622 (8764).
052:013 Behold, my servant H5650 shall deal prudently H7919 (8686), he shall be exalted H7311 (8799) and extolled H5375 (8738), and be very H3966 high H1361 (8804).
052:014 As many H7227 were astonied H8074 (8804) at thee; his visage H4758 was so marred H4893 more than any man H0376, and his form H8389 more than the sons H1121 of men H0120:
052:015 So shall he sprinkle H5137 (8686) many H7227 nations H1471; the kings H4428 shall shut H7092 (8799) their mouths H6310 at him: for [that] which had not been told H5608 (8795) them shall they see H7200 (8804); and [that] which they had not heard H8085 (8804) shall they consider H0995 (8712).
053:001 ¶  Who hath believed H0539 (8689) our report H8052? and to whom is the arm H2220 of the LORD H3068 revealed H1540 (8738)?
053:002 For he shall grow up H5927 (8799) before H6440 him as a tender plant H3126, and as a root H8328 out of a dry H6723 ground H0776: he hath no form H8389 nor comeliness H1926; and when we shall see H7200 (8799) him, [there is] no beauty H4758 that we should desire H2530 (8799) him.
053:003 He is despised H0959 (8737) and rejected H2310 of men H0376; a man H0376 of sorrows H4341, and acquainted H3045 (8803) with grief H2483: and we hid as it were H4564 (8688) [our] faces H6440 from him; he was despised H0959 (8737), and we esteemed H2803 (8804) him not.
053:004 Surely H0403 he hath borne H5375 (8804) our griefs H2483, and carried H5445 (8804) our sorrows H4341: yet we did esteem H2803 (8804) him stricken H5060 (8803), smitten H5221 (8716) of God H0430, and afflicted H6031 (8794).
053:005 But he [was] wounded H2490 (8775) for our transgressions H6588, [he was] bruised H1792 (8794) for our iniquities H5771: the chastisement H4148 of our peace H7965 [was] upon him; and with his stripes H2250 we are healed H7495 (8738).
053:006 All we like sheep H6629 have gone astray H8582 (8804); we have turned H6437 (8804) every one H0376 to his own way H1870; and the LORD H3068 hath laid H6293 (8689) on him the iniquity H5771 of us all.
053:007 He was oppressed H5065 (8738), and he was afflicted H6031 (8737), yet he opened H6605 (8799) not his mouth H6310: he is brought H2986 (8714) as a lamb H7716 to the slaughter H2874, and as a sheep H7353 before H6440 her shearers H1494 (8802) is dumb H0481 (8738), so he openeth H6605 (8799) not his mouth H6310.
053:008 He was taken H3947 (8795) from prison H6115 and from judgment H4941: and who shall declare H7878 (8787) his generation H1755? for he was cut off H1504 (8738) out of the land H0776 of the living H2416: for the transgression H6588 of my people H5971 was he stricken H5061.
053:009 And he made H5414 (8799) his grave H6913 with the wicked H7563, and with the rich H6223 in his death H4194; because he had done H6213 (8804) no violence H2555, neither [was any] deceit H4820 in his mouth H6310.
053:010 Yet it pleased H2654 (8804) the LORD H3068 to bruise H1792 (8763) him; he hath put [him] to grief H2470 (8689): when thou shalt make H7760 (8799) his soul H5315 an offering for sin H0817, he shall see H7200 (8799) [his] seed H2233, he shall prolong H0748 (8686) [his] days H3117, and the pleasure H2656 of the LORD H3068 shall prosper H6743 (8799) in his hand H3027.
053:011 He shall see H7200 (8799) of the travail H5999 of his soul H5315, [and] shall be satisfied H7646 (8799): by his knowledge H1847 shall my righteous H6662 servant H5650 justify H6663 (8686) many H7227; for he shall bear H5445 (8799) their iniquities H5771.
053:012 Therefore will I divide H2505 (8762) him [a portion] with the great H7227, and he shall divide H2505 (8762) the spoil H7998 with the strong H6099; because he hath poured out H6168 (8689) his soul H5315 unto death H4194: and he was numbered H4487 (8738) with the transgressors H6586 (8802); and he bare H5375 (8804) the sin H2399 of many H7227, and made intercession H6293 (8686) for the transgressors H6586 (8802).
054:001 ¶  Sing H7442 (8798), O barren H6135, thou [that] didst not bear H3205 (8804); break forth H6476 (8798) into singing H7440, and cry aloud H6670 (8761), thou [that] didst not travail with child H2342 (8804): for more H7227 [are] the children H1121 of the desolate H8074 (8802) than the children H1121 of the married wife H1166 (8803), saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
054:002 Enlarge H7337 (8685) the place H4725 of thy tent H0168, and let them stretch forth H5186 (8686) the curtains H3407 of thine habitations H4908: spare H2820 (8799) not, lengthen H0748 (8685) thy cords H4340, and strengthen H2388 (8761) thy stakes H3489;
054:003 For thou shalt break forth H6555 (8799) on the right hand H3225 and on the left H8040; and thy seed H2233 shall inherit H3423 (8799) the Gentiles H1471, and make the desolate H8074 (8737) cities H5892 to be inhabited H3427 (8686).
054:004 Fear H3372 (8799) not; for thou shalt not be ashamed H0954 (8799): neither be thou confounded H3637 (8735); for thou shalt not be put to shame H2659 (8686): for thou shalt forget H7911 (8799) the shame H1322 of thy youth H5934, and shalt not remember H2142 (8799) the reproach H2781 of thy widowhood H0491 any more.
054:005 For thy Maker H6213 (8802) [is] thine husband H1166 (8802); the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] his name H8034; and thy Redeemer H1350 (8802) the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478; The God H0430 of the whole earth H0776 shall he be called H7121 (8735).
054:006 For the LORD H3068 hath called H7121 (8804) thee as a woman H0802 forsaken H5800 (8803) and grieved H6087 (8803) in spirit H7307, and a wife H0802 of youth H5271, when thou wast refused H3988 (8735), saith H0559 (8804) thy God H0430.
054:007 For a small H6996 moment H7281 have I forsaken H5800 (8804) thee; but with great H1419 mercies H7356 will I gather H6908 (8762) thee.
054:008 In a little H8241 wrath H7110 I hid H5641 (8689) my face H6440 from thee for a moment H7281; but with everlasting H5769 kindness H2617 will I have mercy H7355 (8765) on thee, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 thy Redeemer H1350 (8802).
054:009 For this [is as] the waters H4325 of Noah H5146 unto me: for [as] I have sworn H7650 (8738) that the waters H4325 of Noah H5146 should no more go over H5674 (8800) the earth H0776; so have I sworn H7650 (8738) that I would not be wroth H7107 (8800) with thee, nor rebuke H1605 (8800) thee.
054:010 For the mountains H2022 shall depart H4185 (8799), and the hills H1389 be removed H4131 (8799); but my kindness H2617 shall not depart H4185 (8799) from thee, neither shall the covenant H1285 of my peace H7965 be removed H4131 (8799), saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 that hath mercy H7355 (8764) on thee.
054:011 O thou afflicted H6041, tossed with tempest H5590 (8802), [and] not comforted H5162 (8794), behold, I will lay H7257 (8688) thy stones H0068 with fair colours H6320, and lay thy foundations H3245 (8804) with sapphires H5601.
054:012 And I will make H7760 (8804) thy windows H8121 of agates H3539, and thy gates H8179 of carbuncles H0068 H0688, and all thy borders H1366 of pleasant H2656 stones H0068.
054:013 And all thy children H1121 [shall be] taught H3928 of the LORD H3068; and great H7227 [shall be] the peace H7965 of thy children H1121.
054:014 In righteousness H6666 shalt thou be established H3559 (8709): thou shalt be far H7368 (8798) from oppression H6233; for thou shalt not fear H3372 (8799): and from terror H4288; for it shall not come near H7126 (8799) thee.
054:015 Behold, they shall surely H1481 (8800) gather together H1481 (8799), [but] not H0657 by me: whosoever H4310 shall gather together H1481 (8804) against thee shall fall H5307 (8799) for thy sake.
054:016 Behold, I have created H1254 (8804) the smith H2796 that bloweth H5301 (8802) the coals H6352 in the fire H0784, and that bringeth forth H3318 (8688) an instrument H3627 for his work H4639; and I have created H1254 (8804) the waster H7843 (8688) to destroy H2254 (8763).
054:017 No weapon H3627 that is formed H3335 (8714) against thee shall prosper H6743 (8799); and every tongue H3956 [that] shall rise H6965 (8799) against thee in judgment H4941 thou shalt condemn H7561 (8686). This [is] the heritage H5159 of the servants H5650 of the LORD H3068, and their righteousness H6666 [is] of me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
055:001 ¶  Ho H1945, every one that thirsteth H6771, come H3212 (8798) ye to the waters H4325, and he that hath no money H3701; come H3212 (8798) ye, buy H7666 (8798), and eat H0398 (8798); yea, come H3212 (8798), buy H7666 (8798) wine H3196 and milk H2461 without money H3701 and without price H4242.
055:002 Wherefore do ye spend H8254 (8799) money H3701 for [that which is] not bread H3899? and your labour H3018 for [that which] satisfieth H7654 not H3808? hearken H8085 (8798) diligently H8085 (8800) unto me, and eat H0398 (8798) ye [that which is] good H2896, and let your soul H5315 delight H6026 (8691) itself in fatness H1880.
055:003 Incline H5186 (8685) your ear H0241, and come H3212 (8798) unto me: hear H8085 (8798), and your soul H5315 shall live H2421 (8799); and I will make H3772 (8799) an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285 with you, [even] the sure H0539 (8737) mercies H2617 of David H1732.
055:004 Behold, I have given H5414 (8804) him [for] a witness H5707 to the people H3816, a leader H5057 and commander H6680 (8764) to the people H3816.
055:005 Behold, thou shalt call H7121 (8799) a nation H1471 [that] thou knowest H3045 (8799) not, and nations H1471 [that] knew H3045 (8804) not thee shall run H7323 (8799) unto thee because of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and for the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478; for he hath glorified H6286 (8765) thee.
055:006 Seek H1875 (8798) ye the LORD H3068 while he may be found H4672 (8736), call H7121 (8798) ye upon him while he is near H7138:
055:007 Let the wicked H7563 forsake H5800 (8799) his way H1870, and the unrighteous H0205 man H0376 his thoughts H4284: and let him return H7725 (8799) unto the LORD H3068, and he will have mercy H7355 (8762) upon him; and to our God H0430, for he will abundantly H7235 (8686) pardon H5545 (8800).
055:008 For my thoughts H4284 [are] not your thoughts H4284, neither [are] your ways H1870 my ways H1870, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
055:009 For [as] the heavens H8064 are higher H1361 (8804) than the earth H0776, so are my ways H1870 higher H1361 (8804) than your ways H1870, and my thoughts H4284 than your thoughts H4284.
055:010 For as the rain H1653 cometh down H3381 (8799), and the snow H7950 from heaven H8064, and returneth H7725 (8799) not thither, but watereth H7301 (8689) the earth H0776, and maketh it bring forth H3205 (8689) and bud H6779 (8689), that it may give H5414 (8804) seed H2233 to the sower H2232 (8802), and bread H3899 to the eater H0398 (8802):
055:011 So shall my word H1697 be that goeth forth H3318 (8799) out of my mouth H6310: it shall not return H7725 (8799) unto me void H7387, but it shall accomplish H6213 (8804) that which I please H2654 (8804), and it shall prosper H6743 (8689) [in the thing] whereto I sent H7971 (8804) it.
055:012 For ye shall go out H3318 (8799) with joy H8057, and be led forth H2986 (8714) with peace H7965: the mountains H2022 and the hills H1389 shall break forth H6476 (8799) before H6440 you into singing H7440, and all the trees H6086 of the field H7704 shall clap H4222 (8799) [their] hands H3709.
055:013 Instead of the thorn H5285 shall come up H5927 (8799) the fir tree H1265, and instead of the brier H5636 shall come up H5927 (8799) the myrtle tree H1918: and it shall be to the LORD H3068 for a name H8034, for an everlasting H5769 sign H0226 [that] shall not be cut off H3772 (8735).
056:001 ¶  Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Keep H8104 (8798) ye judgment H4941, and do H6213 (8798) justice H6666: for my salvation H3444 [is] near H7138 to come H0935 (8800), and my righteousness H6666 to be revealed H1540 (8736).
056:002 Blessed H0835 [is] the man H0582 [that] doeth H6213 (8799) this, and the son H1121 of man H0120 [that] layeth hold H2388 (8686) on it; that keepeth H8104 (8802) the sabbath H7676 from polluting H2490 (8763) it, and keepeth H8104 (8802) his hand H3027 from doing H6213 (8800) any evil H7451.
056:003 Neither let the son H1121 of the stranger H5236, that hath joined H3867 (8738) himself to the LORD H3068, speak H0559 (8799), saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 hath utterly H0914 (8687) separated H0914 (8686) me from his people H5971: neither let the eunuch H5631 say H0559 (8799), Behold, I [am] a dry H3002 tree H6086.
056:004 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 unto the eunuchs H5631 that keep H8104 (8799) my sabbaths H7676, and choose H0977 (8804) [the things] that please H2654 (8804) me, and take hold H2388 (8688) of my covenant H1285;
056:005 Even unto them will I give H5414 (8804) in mine house H1004 and within my walls H2346 a place H3027 and a name H8034 better H2896 than of sons H1121 and of daughters H1323: I will give H5414 (8799) them an everlasting H5769 name H8034, that shall not be cut off H3772 (8735).
056:006 Also the sons H1121 of the stranger H5236, that join H3867 (8737) themselves to the LORD H3068, to serve H8334 (8763) him, and to love H0157 (8800) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068, to be his servants H5650, every one that keepeth H8104 (8802) the sabbath H7676 from polluting H2490 (8763) it, and taketh hold H2388 (8688) of my covenant H1285;
056:007 Even them will I bring H0935 (8689) to my holy H6944 mountain H2022, and make them joyful H8055 (8765) in my house H1004 of prayer H8605: their burnt offerings H5930 and their sacrifices H2077 [shall be] accepted H7522 upon mine altar H4196; for mine house H1004 shall be called H7121 (8735) an house H1004 of prayer H8605 for all people H5971.
056:008 The Lord H0136 GOD H3069 which gathereth H6908 (8764) the outcasts H1760 (8737) of Israel H3478 saith H5002 (8803), Yet will I gather H6908 (8762) [others] to him, beside those that are gathered H6908 (8737) unto him.
056:009 All ye beasts H2416 of the field H7704, come H0857 (8798) to devour H0398 (8800), [yea], all ye beasts H2416 in the forest H3293.
056:010 His watchmen H6822 (8802) [are] blind H5787: they are all ignorant H3045 (8804), they [are] all dumb H0483 dogs H3611, they cannot H3201 (8799) bark H5024 (8800); sleeping H1957 (8802), lying down H7901 (8802), loving H0157 (8802) to slumber H5123 (8800).
056:011 Yea, [they are] greedy H5794 H5315 dogs H3611 [which] can H3045 (8804) never have H3045 (8804) enough H7654, and they [are] shepherds H7462 (8802) [that] cannot understand H0995 (8687): they all look H6437 (8804) to their own way H1870, every one H0376 for his gain H1215, from his quarter H7097.
056:012 Come H0857 (8798) ye, [say they], I will fetch H3947 (8799) wine H3196, and we will fill H5433 (8799) ourselves with strong drink H7941; and to morrow H4279 shall be as this day H3117, [and] much H3966 more H3499 abundant H1419.
057:001 ¶  The righteous H6662 perisheth H0006 (8804), and no man H0376 layeth H7760 (8802) [it] to heart H3820: and merciful H2617 men H0582 [are] taken away H0622 (8737), none considering H0995 (8688) that the righteous H6662 is taken away H0622 (8738) from H6440 the evil H7451 [to come].
057:002 He shall enter H0935 (8799) into peace H7965: they shall rest H5117 (8799) in their beds H4904, [each one] walking H1980 (8802) [in] his uprightness H5228.
057:003 But draw near H7126 (8798) hither, ye sons H1121 of the sorceress H6049 (8781), the seed H2233 of the adulterer H5003 (8764) and the whore H2181 (8799).
057:004 Against whom do ye sport H6026 (8691) yourselves? against whom make ye a wide H7337 (8686) mouth H6310, [and] draw out H0748 (8686) the tongue H3956? [are] ye not children H3206 of transgression H6588, a seed H2233 of falsehood H8267,
057:005 Enflaming H2552 (8737) yourselves with idols H0410 under every green H7488 tree H6086, slaying H7819 (8802) the children H3206 in the valleys H5158 under the clifts H5585 of the rocks H5553?
057:006 Among the smooth H2511 [stones] of the stream H5158 [is] thy portion H2506; they, they [are] thy lot H1486: even to them hast thou poured H8210 (8804) a drink offering H5262, thou hast offered H5927 (8689) a meat offering H4503. Should I receive comfort H5162 (8735) in these?
057:007 Upon a lofty H1364 and high H5375 (8737) mountain H2022 hast thou set H7760 (8804) thy bed H4904: even thither wentest thou up H5927 (8804) to offer H2076 (8800) sacrifice H2077.
057:008 Behind H0310 the doors H1817 also and the posts H4201 hast thou set up H7760 (8804) thy remembrance H2146: for thou hast discovered H1540 (8765) [thyself to another] than me, and art gone up H5927 (8799); thou hast enlarged H7337 (8689) thy bed H4904, and made H3772 (8799) thee [a covenant] with them; thou lovedst H0157 (8804) their bed H4904 where H3027 thou sawest H2372 (8804) [it].
057:009 And thou wentest H7788 (8799) to the king H4428 with ointment H8081, and didst increase H7235 (8686) thy perfumes H7547, and didst send H7971 (8762) thy messengers H6735 far off H7350, and didst debase H8213 (8686) [thyself even] unto hell H7585.
057:010 Thou art wearied H3021 (8804) in the greatness H7230 of thy way H1870; [yet] saidst H0559 (8804) thou not, There is no hope H2976 (8737): thou hast found H4672 (8804) the life H2416 of thine hand H3027; therefore thou wast not grieved H2470 (8804).
057:011 And of whom hast thou been afraid H1672 (8804) or feared H3372 (8799), that thou hast lied H3576 (8762), and hast not remembered H2142 (8804) me, nor laid H7760 (8804) [it] to thy heart H3820? have not I held my peace H2814 (8688) even of old H5769, and thou fearest H3372 (8799) me not?
057:012 I will declare H5046 (8686) thy righteousness H6666, and thy works H4639; for they shall not profit H3276 (8686) thee.
057:013 When thou criest H2199 (8800), let thy companies H6899 deliver H5337 (8686) thee; but the wind H7307 shall carry them all away H5375 (8799); vanity H1892 shall take H3947 (8799) [them]: but he that putteth his trust H2620 (8802) in me shall possess H5157 (8799) the land H0776, and shall inherit H3423 (8799) my holy H6944 mountain H2022;
057:014 And shall say H0559 (8804), Cast ye up H5549 (8798), cast ye up H5549 (8798), prepare H6437 (8761) the way H1870, take up H7311 (8685) the stumblingblock H4383 out of the way H1870 of my people H5971.
057:015 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the high H7311 (8802) and lofty One H5375 (8737) that inhabiteth H7931 (8802) eternity H5703, whose name H8034 [is] Holy H6918; I dwell H7931 (8799) in the high H4791 and holy H6918 [place], with him also [that is] of a contrite H1793 and humble H8217 spirit H7307, to revive H2421 (8687) the spirit H7307 of the humble H8217, and to revive H2421 (8687) the heart H3820 of the contrite ones H1792 (8737).
057:016 For I will not contend H7378 (8799) for ever H5769, neither will I be always H5331 wroth H7107 (8799): for the spirit H7307 should fail H5848 (8799) before H6440 me, and the souls H5397 [which] I have made H6213 (8804).
057:017 For the iniquity H5771 of his covetousness H1215 was I wroth H7107 (8804), and smote H5221 (8686) him: I hid H5641 (8687) me, and was wroth H7107 (8799), and he went on H3212 (8799) frowardly H7726 in the way H1870 of his heart H3820.
057:018 I have seen H7200 (8804) his ways H1870, and will heal H7495 (8799) him: I will lead H5148 (8686) him also, and restore H7999 (8762) comforts H5150 unto him and to his mourners H0057.
057:019 I create H1254 (8802) the fruit H5108 of the lips H8193; Peace H7965, peace H7965 to [him that is] far off H7350, and to [him that is] near H7138, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; and I will heal H7495 (8804) him.
057:020 But the wicked H7563 [are] like the troubled H1644 (8737) sea H3220, when it cannot H3201 (8799) rest H8252 (8687), whose waters H4325 cast up H1644 (8799) mire H7516 and dirt H2916.
057:021 [There is] no peace H7965, saith H0559 (8804) my God H0430, to the wicked H7563.
058:001 ¶  Cry H7121 (8798) aloud H1627, spare H2820 (8799) not, lift H7311 (8685) up thy voice H6963 like a trumpet H7782, and shew H5046 (8685) my people H5971 their transgression H6588, and the house H1004 of Jacob H3290 their sins H2403.
058:002 Yet they seek H1875 (8799) me daily H3117 H3117, and delight H2654 (8799) to know H1847 my ways H1870, as a nation H1471 that did H6213 (8804) righteousness H6666, and forsook H5800 (8804) not the ordinance H4941 of their God H0430: they ask H7592 (8799) of me the ordinances H4941 of justice H6664; they take delight H2654 (8799) in approaching H7132 to God H0430.
058:003 Wherefore have we fasted H6684 (8804), [say they], and thou seest H7200 (8804) not? [wherefore] have we afflicted H6031 (8765) our soul H5315, and thou takest no knowledge H3045 (8799)? Behold, in the day H3117 of your fast H6685 ye find H4672 (8799) pleasure H2656, and exact H5065 (8799) all your labours H6092.
058:004 Behold, ye fast H6684 (8799) for strife H7379 and debate H4683, and to smite H5221 (8687) with the fist H0106 of wickedness H7562: ye shall not fast H6684 (8799) as [ye do this] day H3117, to make your voice H6963 to be heard H8085 (8687) on high H4791.
058:005 Is it such a fast H6685 that I have chosen H0977 (8799)? a day H3117 for a man H0120 to afflict H6031 (8763) his soul H5315? [is it] to bow down H3721 (8800) his head H7218 as a bulrush H0100, and to spread H3331 (8686) sackcloth H8242 and ashes H0665 [under him]? wilt thou call H7121 (8799) this H2088 a fast H6685, and an acceptable H7522 day H3117 to the LORD H3068?
058:006 [Is] not this the fast H6685 that I have chosen H0977 (8799)? to loose H6605 (8763) the bands H2784 of wickedness H7562, to undo H5425 (8687) the heavy H4133 burdens H0092, and to let the oppressed H7533 (8803) go H7971 (8763) free H2670, and that ye break H5423 (8762) every yoke H4133?
058:007 [Is it] not to deal H6536 (8800) thy bread H3899 to the hungry H7457, and that thou bring H0935 (8686) the poor H6041 that are cast out H4788 to thy house H1004? when thou seest H7200 (8799) the naked H6174, that thou cover H3680 (8765) him; and that thou hide H5956 (8691) not thyself from thine own flesh H1320?
058:008 Then shall thy light H0216 break forth H1234 (8735) as the morning H7837, and thine health H0724 shall spring forth H6779 (8799) speedily H4120: and thy righteousness H6664 shall go H1980 (8804) before H6440 thee; the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 shall be thy rereward H0622 (8799).
058:009 Then shalt thou call H7121 (8799), and the LORD H3068 shall answer H6030 (8799); thou shalt cry H7768 (8762), and he shall say H0559 (8799), Here I [am]. If thou take away H5493 (8686) from the midst H8432 of thee the yoke H4133, the putting forth H7971 (8800) of the finger H0676, and speaking H1696 (8763) vanity H0205;
058:010 And [if] thou draw out H6329 (8686) thy soul H5315 to the hungry H7457, and satisfy H7646 (8686) the afflicted H6031 (8737) soul H5315; then shall thy light H0216 rise H2224 (8804) in obscurity H2822, and thy darkness H0653 [be] as the noonday H6672:
058:011 And the LORD H3068 shall guide H5148 (8804) thee continually H8548, and satisfy H7646 (8689) thy soul H5315 in drought H6710, and make fat H2502 (8686) thy bones H6106: and thou shalt be like a watered H7302 garden H1588, and like a spring H4161 of water H4325, whose waters H4325 fail H3576 (8762) not.
058:012 And [they that shall be] of thee shall build H1129 (8804) the old H5769 waste places H2723: thou shalt raise up H6965 (8787) the foundations H4146 of many H1755 generations H1755; and thou shalt be called H7121 (8795), The repairer H1443 (8802) of the breach H6556, The restorer H7725 (8789) of paths H5410 to dwell in H3427 (8800).
058:013 If thou turn away H7725 (8686) thy foot H7272 from the sabbath H7676, [from] doing H6213 (8800) thy pleasure H2656 on my holy H6944 day H3117; and call H7121 (8804) the sabbath H7676 a delight H6027, the holy H6918 of the LORD H3068, honourable H3513 (8794); and shalt honour H3513 (8765) him, not doing H6213 (8800) thine own ways H1870, nor finding H4672 (8800) thine own pleasure H2656, nor speaking H1696 (8763) [thine own] words H1697:
058:014 Then shalt thou delight H6026 (8691) thyself in the LORD H3068; and I will cause thee to ride H7392 (8689) upon the high places H1116 of the earth H0776, and feed H0398 (8689) thee with the heritage H5159 of Jacob H3290 thy father H0001: for the mouth H6310 of the LORD H3068 hath spoken H1696 (8765) [it].
059:001 ¶  Behold H2005, the LORD’S H3068 hand H3027 is not shortened H7114 (8804), that it cannot save H3467 (8687); neither his ear H0241 heavy H3513 (8804), that it cannot hear H8085 (8800):
059:002 But your iniquities H5771 have separated H0914 (8688) between H0996 you and your God H0430, and your sins H2403 have hid H5641 (8689) [his] face H6440 from you, that he will not hear H8085 (8800).
059:003 For your hands H3709 are defiled H1351 (8738) with blood H1818, and your fingers H0676 with iniquity H5771; your lips H8193 have spoken H1696 (8765) lies H8267, your tongue H3956 hath muttered H1897 (8799) perverseness H5766.
059:004 None calleth H7121 (8802) for justice H6664, nor [any] pleadeth H8199 (8737) for truth H0530: they trust H0982 (8800) in vanity H8414, and speak H1696 (8763) lies H7723; they conceive H2029 (8800) mischief H5999, and bring forth H3205 (8687) iniquity H0205.
059:005 They hatch H1234 (8765) cockatrice H6848 ’ eggs H1000, and weave H0707 (8799) the spider’s H5908 web H6980: he that eateth H0398 (8802) of their eggs H1000 dieth H4191 (8799), and that which is crushed H2116 breaketh out H1234 (8735) into a viper H0660.
059:006 Their webs H6980 shall not become garments H0899, neither shall they cover H3680 (8691) themselves with their works H4639: their works H4639 [are] works H4639 of iniquity H0205, and the act H6467 of violence H2555 [is] in their hands H3709.
059:007 Their feet H7272 run H7323 (8799) to evil H7451, and they make haste H4116 (8762) to shed H8210 (8800) innocent H5355 blood H1818: their thoughts H4284 [are] thoughts H4284 of iniquity H0205; wasting H7701 and destruction H7667 [are] in their paths H4546.
059:008 The way H1870 of peace H7965 they know H3045 (8804) not; and [there is] no judgment H4941 in their goings H4570: they have made them crooked H6140 (8765) paths H5410: whosoever goeth H1869 (8802) therein shall not know H3045 (8804) peace H7965.
059:009 Therefore is judgment H4941 far H7368 (8804) from us, neither doth justice H6666 overtake H5381 (8686) us: we wait H6960 (8762) for light H0216, but behold obscurity H2822; for brightness H5054, [but] we walk H1980 (8762) in darkness H0653.
059:010 We grope H1659 (8762) for the wall H7023 like the blind H5787, and we grope H1659 (8762) as if [we had] no eyes H5869: we stumble H3782 (8804) at noonday H6672 as in the night H5399; [we are] in desolate H0820 places as dead H4191 (8801) [men].
059:011 We roar H1993 (8799) all like bears H1677, and mourn H1897 (8799) sore H1897 (8800) like doves H3123: we look H6960 (8762) for judgment H4941, but [there is] none; for salvation H3444, [but] it is far off H7368 (8804) from us.
059:012 For our transgressions H6588 are multiplied H7231 (8804) before thee, and our sins H2403 testify H6030 (8804) against us: for our transgressions H6588 [are] with us; and [as for] our iniquities H5771, we know H3045 (8804) them;
059:013 In transgressing H6586 (8800) and lying H3584 (8763) against the LORD H3068, and departing away H5253 (8800) from H0310 our God H0430, speaking H1696 (8763) oppression H6233 and revolt H5627, conceiving H2029 (8780) and uttering H1897 (8774) from the heart H3820 words H1697 of falsehood H8267.
059:014 And judgment H4941 is turned away H5253 (8717) backward H0268, and justice H6666 standeth H5975 (8799) afar off H7350: for truth H0571 is fallen H3782 (8804) in the street H7339, and equity H5229 cannot H3201 (8799) enter H0935 (8800).
059:015 Yea, truth H0571 faileth H5737 (8737); and he [that] departeth H5493 (8804) from evil H7451 maketh himself a prey H7997 (8711): and the LORD H3068 saw H7200 (8799) [it], and it displeased H3415 (8799) H5869 him that [there was] no judgment H4941.
059:016 And he saw H7200 (8799) that [there was] no man H0376, and wondered H8074 (8709) that [there was] no intercessor H6293 (8688): therefore his arm H2220 brought salvation H3467 (8686) unto him; and his righteousness H6666, it sustained H5564 (8804) him.
059:017 For he put on H3847 (8799) righteousness H6666 as a breastplate H8302, and an helmet H3553 of salvation H3444 upon his head H7218; and he put on H3847 (8799) the garments H0899 of vengeance H5359 [for] clothing H8516, and was clad H5844 (8799) with zeal H7068 as a cloke H4598.
059:018 According to H5921 [their] deeds H1578, accordingly he will repay H7999 (8762), fury H2534 to his adversaries H6862, recompence H1576 to his enemies H0341 (8802); to the islands H0339 he will repay H7999 (8762) recompence H1576.
059:019 So shall they fear H3372 (8799) the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 from the west H4628, and his glory H3519 from the rising H4217 of the sun H8121. When the enemy H6862 shall come in H0935 (8799) like a flood H5104, the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 shall lift up a standard H5127 (8790) against him.
059:020 And the Redeemer H1350 (8802) shall come H0935 (8804) to Zion H6726, and unto them that turn H7725 (8802) from transgression H6588 in Jacob H3290, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
059:021 As for me, this [is] my covenant H1285 with them, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068; My spirit H7307 that [is] upon thee, and my words H1697 which I have put H7760 (8804) in thy mouth H6310, shall not depart H4185 (8799) out of thy mouth H6310, nor out of the mouth H6310 of thy seed H2233, nor out of the mouth H6310 of thy seed’s H2233 seed H2233, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, from henceforth and for H5704 ever H5769.
060:001 ¶  Arise H6965 (8798), shine H0215 (8798); for thy light H0216 is come H0935 (8804), and the glory H3519 of the LORD H3068 is risen H2224 (8804) upon thee.
060:002 For, behold, the darkness H2822 shall cover H3680 (8762) the earth H0776, and gross darkness H6205 the people H3816: but the LORD H3068 shall arise H2224 (8799) upon thee, and his glory H3519 shall be seen H7200 (8735) upon thee.
060:003 And the Gentiles H1471 shall come H1980 (8804) to thy light H0216, and kings H4428 to the brightness H5051 of thy rising H2225.
060:004 Lift up H5375 (8798) thine eyes H5869 round about H5439, and see H7200 (8798): all they gather themselves together H6908 (8738), they come H0935 (8804) to thee: thy sons H1121 shall come H0935 (8799) from far H7350, and thy daughters H1323 shall be nursed H0539 (8735) at [thy] side H6654.
060:005 Then thou shalt see H7200 (8799) (8675) H3372 (8799), and flow together H5102 (8804), and thine heart H3824 shall fear H6342 (8804), and be enlarged H7337 (8804); because the abundance H1995 of the sea H3220 shall be converted H2015 (8735) unto thee, the forces H2428 of the Gentiles H1471 shall come H0935 (8799) unto thee.
060:006 The multitude H8229 of camels H1581 shall cover H3680 (8762) thee, the dromedaries H1070 of Midian H4080 and Ephah H5891; all they from Sheba H7614 shall come H0935 (8799): they shall bring H5375 (8799) gold H2091 and incense H3828; and they shall shew forth H1319 (8762) the praises H8416 of the LORD H3068.
060:007 All the flocks H6629 of Kedar H6938 shall be gathered together H6908 (8735) unto thee, the rams H0352 of Nebaioth H5032 shall minister H8334 (8762) unto thee: they shall come up H5927 (8799) with acceptance H7522 on mine altar H4196, and I will glorify H6286 (8762) the house H1004 of my glory H8597.
060:008 Who [are] these [that] fly H5774 (8799) as a cloud H5645, and as the doves H3123 to their windows H0699?
060:009 Surely the isles H0339 shall wait H6960 (8762) for me, and the ships H0591 of Tarshish H8659 first H7223, to bring H0935 (8687) thy sons H1121 from far H7350, their silver H3701 and their gold H2091 with them, unto the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, and to the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478, because he hath glorified H6286 (8765) thee.
060:010 And the sons H1121 of strangers H5236 shall build up H1129 (8804) thy walls H2346, and their kings H4428 shall minister H8334 (8762) unto thee: for in my wrath H7110 I smote H5221 (8689) thee, but in my favour H7522 have I had mercy H7355 (8765) on thee.
060:011 Therefore thy gates H8179 shall be open H6605 (8765) continually H8548; they shall not be shut H5462 (8735) day H3119 nor night H3915; that [men] may bring H0935 (8687) unto thee the forces H2428 of the Gentiles H1471, and [that] their kings H4428 [may be] brought H5090 (8803).
060:012 For the nation H1471 and kingdom H4467 that will not serve H5647 (8799) thee shall perish H0006 (8799); yea, [those] nations H1471 shall be utterly H2717 (8800) wasted H2717 (8799).
060:013 The glory H3519 of Lebanon H3844 shall come H0935 (8799) unto thee, the fir tree H1265, the pine tree H8410, and the box H8391 together H3162, to beautify H6286 (8763) the place H4725 of my sanctuary H4720; and I will make the place H4725 of my feet H7272 glorious H3513 (8762).
060:014 The sons H1121 also of them that afflicted H6031 (8764) thee shall come H1980 (8804) bending H7817 (8800) unto thee; and all they that despised H5006 (8764) thee shall bow themselves down H7812 (8694) at the soles H3709 of thy feet H7272; and they shall call H7121 (8804) thee, The city H5892 of the LORD H3068, The Zion H6726 of the Holy One H6918 of Israel H3478.
060:015 Whereas H8478 thou hast been forsaken H5800 (8803) and hated H8130 (8803), so that no man went through H5674 (8802) [thee], I will make H7760 (8804) thee an eternal H5769 excellency H1347, a joy H4885 of many H1755 generations H1755.
060:016 Thou shalt also suck H3243 (8804) the milk H2461 of the Gentiles H1471, and shalt suck H3243 (8799) the breast H7699 of kings H4428: and thou shalt know H3045 (8804) that I the LORD H3068 [am] thy Saviour H3467 (8688) and thy Redeemer H1350 (8802), the mighty One H0046 of Jacob H3290.
060:017 For brass H5178 I will bring H0935 (8686) gold H2091, and for iron H1270 I will bring H0935 (8686) silver H3701, and for wood H6086 brass H5178, and for stones H0068 iron H1270: I will also make H7760 (8804) thy officers H6486 peace H7965, and thine exactors H5065 (8802) righteousness H6666.
060:018 Violence H2555 shall no more be heard H8085 (8735) in thy land H0776, wasting H7701 nor destruction H7667 within thy borders H1366; but thou shalt call H7121 (8804) thy walls H2346 Salvation H3444, and thy gates H8179 Praise H8416.
060:019 The sun H8121 shall be no more thy light H0216 by day H3119; neither for brightness H5051 shall the moon H3394 give light H0216 unto thee: but the LORD H3068 shall be unto thee an everlasting H5769 light H0215 (8686), and thy God H0430 thy glory H8597.
060:020 Thy sun H8121 shall no more go down H0935 (8799); neither shall thy moon H3391 withdraw H0622 (8735) itself: for the LORD H3068 shall be thine everlasting H5769 light H0216, and the days H3117 of thy mourning H0060 shall be ended H7999 (8804).
060:021 Thy people H5971 also [shall be] all righteous H6662: they shall inherit H3423 (8799) the land H0776 for ever H5769, the branch H5342 of my planting H4302, the work H4639 of my hands H3027, that I may be glorified H6286 (8692).
060:022 A little one H6996 shall become a thousand H0505, and a small one H6810 a strong H6099 nation H1471: I the LORD H3068 will hasten H2363 (8686) it in his time H6256.
061:001 ¶  The Spirit H7307 of the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 [is] upon me; because the LORD H3068 hath anointed H4886 (8804) me to preach good tidings H1319 (8763) unto the meek H6035; he hath sent H7971 (8804) me to bind up H2280 (8800) the brokenhearted H7665 (8737) H3820, to proclaim H7121 (8800) liberty H1865 to the captives H7617 (8803), and the opening of the prison H6495 to [them that are] bound H0631 (8803);
061:002 To proclaim H7121 (8800) the acceptable H7522 year H8141 of the LORD H3068, and the day H3117 of vengeance H5359 of our God H0430; to comfort H5162 (8763) all that mourn H0057;
061:003 To appoint H7760 (8800) unto them that mourn H0057 in Zion H6726, to give H5414 (8800) unto them beauty H6287 for ashes H0665, the oil H8081 of joy H8342 for mourning H0060, the garment H4594 of praise H8416 for the spirit H7307 of heaviness H3544; that they might be called H7121 (8795) trees H0352 of righteousness H6664, the planting H4302 of the LORD H3068, that he might be glorified H6286 (8692).
061:004 And they shall build H1129 (8804) the old H5769 wastes H2723, they shall raise up H6965 (8787) the former H7223 desolations H8074 (8802), and they shall repair H2318 (8765) the waste H2721 cities H5892, the desolations H8074 (8802) of many H1755 generations H1755.
061:005 And strangers H2114 (8801) shall stand H5975 (8804) and feed H7462 (8804) your flocks H6629, and the sons H1121 of the alien H5236 [shall be] your plowmen H0406 and your vinedressers H3755.
061:006 But ye shall be named H7121 (8735) the Priests H3548 of the LORD H3068: [men] shall call H0559 (8735) you the Ministers H8334 (8764) of our God H0430: ye shall eat H0398 (8799) the riches H2428 of the Gentiles H1471, and in their glory H3519 shall ye boast H3235 (8691) yourselves.
061:007 For your shame H1322 [ye shall have] double H4932; and [for] confusion H3639 they shall rejoice H7442 (8799) in their portion H2506: therefore in their land H0776 they shall possess H3423 (8799) the double H4932: everlasting H5769 joy H8057 shall be unto them.
061:008 For I the LORD H3068 love H0157 (8802) judgment H4941, I hate H8130 (8802) robbery H1498 for burnt offering H5930; and I will direct H5414 (8804) their work H6468 in truth H0571, and I will make H3772 (8799) an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285 with them.
061:009 And their seed H2233 shall be known H3045 (8738) among the Gentiles H1471, and their offspring H6631 among H8432 the people H5971: all that see H7200 (8802) them shall acknowledge H5234 (8686) them, that they [are] the seed H2233 [which] the LORD H3068 hath blessed H1288 (8765).
061:010 I will greatly H7797 (8800) rejoice H7797 (8799) in the LORD H3068, my soul H5315 shall be joyful H1523 (8799) in my God H0430; for he hath clothed H3847 (8689) me with the garments H0899 of salvation H3468, he hath covered H3271 (8804) me with the robe H4598 of righteousness H6666, as a bridegroom H2860 decketh H3547 (8762) [himself] with ornaments H6287, and as a bride H3618 adorneth H5710 (8799) [herself] with her jewels H3627.
061:011 For as the earth H0776 bringeth forth H3318 (8686) her bud H6780, and as the garden H1593 causeth the things that are sown H2221 in it to spring forth H6779 (8686); so the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 will cause righteousness H6666 and praise H8416 to spring forth H6779 (8686) before all the nations H1471.
062:001 ¶  For Zion’s H6726 sake will I not hold my peace H2814 (8799), and for Jerusalem’s H3389 sake I will not rest H8252 (8799), until the righteousness H6664 thereof go forth H3318 (8799) as brightness H5051, and the salvation H3444 thereof as a lamp H3940 [that] burneth H1197 (8799).
062:002 And the Gentiles H1471 shall see H7200 (8804) thy righteousness H6664, and all kings H4428 thy glory H3519: and thou shalt be called H7121 (8795) by a new H2319 name H5344 (8799), which the mouth H6310 of the LORD H3068 shall name H8034.
062:003 Thou shalt also be a crown H5850 of glory H8597 in the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068, and a royal H4410 diadem H6797 (8675) H6797 in the hand H3709 of thy God H0430.
062:004 Thou shalt no more be termed H0559 (8735) Forsaken H5800 (8803); neither shall thy land H0776 any more be termed H0559 (8735) Desolate H8077: but thou shalt be called H7121 (8735) Hephzibah H2657, and thy land H0776 Beulah H1166 (8803): for the LORD H3068 delighteth H2654 (8804) in thee, and thy land H0776 shall be married H1166 (8735).
062:005 For [as] a young man H0970 marrieth H1166 (8799) a virgin H1330, [so] shall thy sons H1121 marry H1166 (8799) thee: and [as] the bridegroom H2860 rejoiceth H4885 over the bride H3618, [so] shall thy God H0430 rejoice H7797 (8799) over thee.
062:006 I have set H6485 (8689) watchmen H8104 (8802) upon thy walls H2346, O Jerusalem H3389, [which] shall never H8548 hold their peace H2814 (8799) day H3117 nor night H3915: ye that make mention H2142 (8688) of the LORD H3068, keep not silence H1824,
062:007 And give H5414 (8799) him no rest H1824, till he establish H3559 (8787), and till he make H7760 (8799) Jerusalem H3389 a praise H8416 in the earth H0776.
062:008 The LORD H3068 hath sworn H7650 (8738) by his right hand H3225, and by the arm H2220 of his strength H5797, Surely I will H0518 no more give H5414 (8799) thy corn H1715 [to be] meat H3978 for thine enemies H0341 (8802); and the sons H1121 of the stranger H5236 shall not drink H8354 (8799) thy wine H8492, for the which thou hast laboured H3021 (8804):
062:009 But they that have gathered H0622 (8764) it shall eat H0398 (8799) it, and praise H1984 (8765) the LORD H3068; and they that have brought it together H6908 (8764) shall drink H8354 (8799) it in the courts H2691 of my holiness H6944.
062:010 Go through H5674 (8798), go through H5674 (8798) the gates H8179; prepare H6437 (8761) ye the way H1870 of the people H5971; cast up H5549 (8798), cast up H5549 (8798) the highway H4546; gather out H5619 (8761) the stones H0068; lift up H7311 (8685) a standard H5251 for the people H5971.
062:011 Behold, the LORD H3068 hath proclaimed H8085 (8689) unto the end H7097 of the world H0776, Say H0559 (8798) ye to the daughter H1323 of Zion H6726, Behold, thy salvation H3468 cometh H0935 (8802); behold, his reward H7939 [is] with him, and his work H6468 before H6440 him.
062:012 And they shall call H7121 (8804) them, The holy H6944 people H5971, The redeemed H1350 (8803) of the LORD H3068: and thou shalt be called H7121 (8735), Sought out H1875 (8803), A city H5892 not forsaken H5800 (8737).
063:001 ¶  Who [is] this that cometh H0935 (8802) from Edom H0123, with dyed H2556 (8803) garments H0899 from Bozrah H1224? this [that is] glorious H1921 (8803) in his apparel H3830, travelling H6808 (8802) in the greatness H7230 of his strength H3581? I that speak H1696 (8764) in righteousness H6666, mighty H7227 to save H3467 (8687).
063:002 Wherefore [art thou] red H0122 in thine apparel H3830, and thy garments H0899 like him that treadeth H1869 (8802) in the winefat H1660?
063:003 I have trodden H1869 (8804) the winepress H6333 alone; and of the people H5971 [there was] none H0376 with me: for I will tread H1869 (8799) them in mine anger H0639, and trample H7429 (8799) them in my fury H2534; and their blood H5332 shall be sprinkled H5137 (8799) upon my garments H0899, and I will stain H1351 (8689) all my raiment H4403.
063:004 For the day H3117 of vengeance H5359 [is] in mine heart H3820, and the year H8141 of my redeemed H1350 (8803) is come H0935 (8804).
063:005 And I looked H5027 (8686), and [there was] none to help H5826 (8802); and I wondered H8074 (8709) that [there was] none to uphold H5564 (8802): therefore mine own arm H2220 brought salvation H3467 (8686) unto me; and my fury H2534, it upheld H5564 (8804) me.
063:006 And I will tread down H0947 (8799) the people H5971 in mine anger H0639, and make them drunk H7937 (8762) in my fury H2534, and I will bring down H3381 (8686) their strength H5332 to the earth H0776.
063:007 I will mention H2142 (8686) the lovingkindnesses H2617 of the LORD H3068, [and] the praises H8416 of the LORD H3068, according to all that the LORD H3068 hath bestowed H1580 (8804) on us, and the great H7227 goodness H2898 toward the house H1004 of Israel H3478, which he hath bestowed H1580 (8804) on them according to his mercies H7356, and according to the multitude H7230 of his lovingkindnesses H2617.
063:008 For he said H0559 (8799), Surely they [are] my people H5971, children H1121 [that] will not lie H8266 (8762): so he was their Saviour H3467 (8688).
063:009 In all their affliction H6869 he was afflicted H6862, and the angel H4397 of his presence H6440 saved H3467 (8689) them: in his love H0160 and in his pity H2551 he redeemed H1350 (8804) them; and he bare H5190 (8762) them, and carried H5375 (8762) them all the days H3117 of old H5769.
063:010 But they rebelled H4784 (8804), and vexed H6087 (8765) his holy H6944 Spirit H7307: therefore he was turned H2015 (8735) to be their enemy H0341 (8802), [and] he fought H3898 (8738) against them.
063:011 Then he remembered H2142 (8799) the days H3117 of old H5769, Moses H4872, [and] his people H5971, [saying], Where [is] he that brought them up H5927 (8688) out of the sea H3220 with the shepherd H7462 (8802) of his flock H6629? where [is] he that put H7760 (8802) his holy H6944 Spirit H7307 within H7130 him?
063:012 That led H3212 (8688) [them] by the right hand H3225 of Moses H4872 with his glorious H8597 arm H2220, dividing H1234 (8802) the water H4325 before H6440 them, to make H6213 (8800) himself an everlasting H5769 name H8034?
063:013 That led H3212 (8688) them through the deep H8415, as an horse H5483 in the wilderness H4057, [that] they should not stumble H3782 (8735)?
063:014 As a beast H0929 goeth down H3381 (8799) into the valley H1237, the Spirit H7307 of the LORD H3068 caused him to rest H5117 (8686): so didst thou lead H5090 (8765) thy people H5971, to make H6213 (8800) thyself a glorious H8597 name H8034.
063:015 Look down H5027 (8685) from heaven H8064, and behold H7200 (8798) from the habitation H2073 of thy holiness H6944 and of thy glory H8597: where [is] thy zeal H7068 and thy strength H1369, the sounding H1995 of thy bowels H4578 and of thy mercies H7356 toward me? are they restrained H0662 (8694)?
063:016 Doubtless H3588 thou [art] our father H0001, though Abraham H0085 be ignorant H3808 H3045 (8804) of us, and Israel H3478 acknowledge H5234 (8686) us not: thou, O LORD H3068, [art] our father H0001, our redeemer H1350 (8802); thy name H8034 [is] from everlasting H5769.
063:017 O LORD H3068, why hast thou made us to err H8582 (8686) from thy ways H1870, [and] hardened H7188 (8686) our heart H3820 from thy fear H3374? Return H7725 (8798) for thy servants H5650 ’ sake, the tribes H7626 of thine inheritance H5159.
063:018 The people H5971 of thy holiness H6944 have possessed H3423 (8804) [it] but a little while H4705: our adversaries H6862 have trodden down H0947 (8790) thy sanctuary H4720.
063:019 We are [thine]: thou never H5769 barest rule H4910 (8804) over them; they were not called H7121 (8738) by thy name H8034.
064:001 ¶  Oh H3863 that thou wouldest rend H7167 (8804) the heavens H8064, that thou wouldest come down H3381 (8804), that the mountains H2022 might flow down H2151 (8738) at thy presence H6440,
064:002 As [when] the melting H2003 fire H0784 burneth H6919 (8800), the fire H0784 causeth the waters H4325 to boil H1158 (8799), to make thy name H8034 known H3045 (8687) to thine adversaries H6862, [that] the nations H1471 may tremble H7264 (8799) at thy presence H6440!
064:003 When thou didst H6213 (8800) terrible things H3372 (8737) [which] we looked H6960 (8762) not for, thou camest down H3381 (8804), the mountains H2022 flowed down H2151 (8738) at thy presence H6440.
064:004 For since the beginning of the world H5769 [men] have not heard H8085 (8804), nor perceived by the ear H0238 (8689), neither hath the eye H5869 seen H7200 (8804), O God H0430, beside H2108 thee, [what] he hath prepared H6213 (8799) for him that waiteth H2442 (8764) for him.
064:005 Thou meetest H6293 (8804) him that rejoiceth H7797 (8801) and worketh H6213 (8802) righteousness H6664, [those that] remember H2142 (8799) thee in thy ways H1870: behold, thou art wroth H7107 (8804); for we have sinned H2398 (8799): in those is continuance H5769, and we shall be saved H3467 (8735).
064:006 But we are all as an unclean H2931 [thing], and all our righteousnesses H6666 [are] as filthy H5708 rags H0899; and we all do fade H5034 (8799) (8676) H1101 (8686) as a leaf H5929; and our iniquities H5771, like the wind H7307, have taken us away H5375 (8799).
064:007 And [there is] none that calleth H7121 (8802) upon thy name H8034, that stirreth up H5782 (8711) himself to take hold H2388 (8687) of thee: for thou hast hid H5641 (8689) thy face H6440 from us, and hast consumed H4127 (8799) us, because H3027 of our iniquities H5771.
064:008 But now, O LORD H3068, thou [art] our father H0001; we [are] the clay H2563, and thou our potter H3335 (8802); and we all [are] the work H4639 of thy hand H3027.
064:009 Be not wroth H7107 (8799) very sore H3966, O LORD H3068, neither remember H2142 (8799) iniquity H5771 for ever H5703: behold, see H5027 (8685), we beseech thee, we [are] all thy people H5971.
064:010 Thy holy H6944 cities H5892 are a wilderness H4057, Zion H6726 is a wilderness H4057, Jerusalem H3389 a desolation H8077.
064:011 Our holy H6944 and our beautiful H8597 house H1004, where our fathers H0001 praised H1984 (8765) thee, is burned up H8316 with fire H0784: and all our pleasant things H4261 are laid waste H2723.
064:012 Wilt thou refrain H0662 (8691) thyself for these [things], O LORD H3068? wilt thou hold thy peace H2814 (8799), and afflict H6031 (8762) us very sore H3966?
065:001 ¶  I am sought H1875 (8738) of [them that] asked H7592 (8804) not H3808 [for me]; I am found H4672 (8738) of [them that] sought H1245 (8765) me not H3808: I said H0559 (8804), Behold me, behold me, unto a nation H1471 [that] was not called H7121 (8795) by my name H8034.
065:002 I have spread out H6566 (8765) my hands H3027 all the day H3117 unto a rebellious H5637 (8802) people H5971, which walketh H1980 (8802) in a way H1870 [that was] not good H2896, after H0310 their own thoughts H4284;
065:003 A people H5971 that provoketh me to anger H3707 (8688) continually H8548 to my face H6440; that sacrificeth H2076 (8802) in gardens H1593, and burneth incense H6999 (8764) upon altars of brick H3843;
065:004 Which remain H3427 (8802) among the graves H6913, and lodge H3885 (8799) in the monuments H5341 (8803), which eat H0398 (8802) swine’s H2386 flesh H1320, and broth H4839 (8675) H6564 of abominable H6292 [things is in] their vessels H3627;
065:005 Which say H0559 (8802), Stand H7126 (8798) by thyself, come not near H5066 (8799) to me; for I am holier H6942 (8804) than thou. These [are] a smoke H6227 in my nose H0639, a fire H0784 that burneth H3344 (8802) all the day H3117.
065:006 Behold, [it is] written H3789 (8803) before H6440 me: I will not keep silence H2814 (8799), but will recompense H7999 (8765), even recompense H7999 (8765) into their bosom H2436,
065:007 Your iniquities H5771, and the iniquities H5771 of your fathers H0001 together H3162, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, which have burned incense H6999 (8765) upon the mountains H2022, and blasphemed H2778 (8765) me upon the hills H1389: therefore will I measure H4058 (8804) their former H7223 work H6468 into their bosom H2436.
065:008 Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, As the new wine H8492 is found H4672 (8735) in the cluster H0811, and [one] saith H0559 (8804), Destroy H7843 (8686) it not; for a blessing H1293 [is] in it: so will I do H6213 (8799) for my servants H5650 ’ sakes, that I may not destroy H7843 (8687) them all.
065:009 And I will bring forth H3318 (8689) a seed H2233 out of Jacob H3290, and out of Judah H3063 an inheritor H3423 (8802) of my mountains H2022: and mine elect H0972 shall inherit H3423 (8804) it, and my servants H5650 shall dwell H7931 (8799) there.
065:010 And Sharon H8289 shall be a fold H5116 of flocks H6629, and the valley H6010 of Achor H5911 a place for the herds H1241 to lie down in H7258, for my people H5971 that have sought H1875 (8804) me.
065:011 But ye [are] they that forsake H5800 (8802) the LORD H3068, that forget H7913 my holy H6944 mountain H2022, that prepare H6186 (8802) a table H7979 for that troop H1409 (8677) H1408, and that furnish H4390 (8764) the drink offering H4469 unto that number H4507.
065:012 Therefore will I number H4487 (8804) you to the sword H2719, and ye shall all bow down H3766 (8799) to the slaughter H2874: because when I called H7121 (8804), ye did not answer H6030 (8804); when I spake H1696 (8765), ye did not hear H8085 (8804); but did H6213 (8799) evil H7451 before mine eyes H5869, and did choose H0977 (8804) [that] wherein I delighted H2654 (8804) not.
065:013 Therefore thus saith H0559 (8804) the Lord H0136 GOD H3069, Behold, my servants H5650 shall eat H0398 (8799), but ye shall be hungry H7456 (8799): behold, my servants H5650 shall drink H8354 (8799), but ye shall be thirsty H6770 (8799): behold, my servants H5650 shall rejoice H8055 (8799), but ye shall be ashamed H0954 (8799):
065:014 Behold, my servants H5650 shall sing H7442 (8799) for joy H2898 of heart H3820, but ye shall cry H6817 (8799) for sorrow H3511 of heart H3820, and shall howl H3213 (8686) for vexation H7667 of spirit H7307.
065:015 And ye shall leave H3240 (8689) your name H8034 for a curse H7621 unto my chosen H0972: for the Lord H0136 GOD H3069 shall slay H4191 (8689) thee, and call H7121 (8799) his servants H5650 by another H0312 name H8034:
065:016 That he who blesseth H1288 (8693) himself in the earth H0776 shall bless H1288 (8691) himself in the God H0430 of truth H0543; and he that sweareth H7650 (8737) in the earth H0776 shall swear H7650 (8735) by the God H0430 of truth H0543; because the former H7223 troubles H6869 are forgotten H7911 (8738), and because they are hid H5641 (8738) from mine eyes H5869.
065:017 For, behold, I create H1254 (8802) new H2319 heavens H8064 and a new H2319 earth H0776: and the former H7223 shall not be remembered H2142 (8735), nor come H5927 (8799) into mind H3820.
065:018 But be ye glad H7797 (8798) and rejoice H1523 (8798) for ever H5703 [in that] which I create H1254 (8802): for, behold, I create H1254 (8802) Jerusalem H3389 a rejoicing H1525, and her people H5971 a joy H4885.
065:019 And I will rejoice H1523 (8804) in Jerusalem H3389, and joy H7797 (8804) in my people H5971: and the voice H6963 of weeping H1065 shall be no more heard H8085 (8735) in her, nor the voice H6963 of crying H2201.
065:020 There shall be no more thence an infant H5764 of days H3117, nor an old man H2205 that hath not filled H4390 (8762) his days H3117: for the child H5288 shall die H4191 (8799) an hundred H3967 years H8141 old H1121; but the sinner H2398 (8802) [being] an hundred H3967 years H8141 old H1121 shall be accursed H7043 (8792).
065:021 And they shall build H1129 (8804) houses H1004, and inhabit H3427 (8804) [them]; and they shall plant H5193 (8804) vineyards H3754, and eat H0398 (8804) the fruit H6529 of them.
065:022 They shall not build H1129 (8799), and another H0312 inhabit H3427 (8799); they shall not plant H5193 (8799), and another H0312 eat H0398 (8799): for as the days H3117 of a tree H6086 [are] the days H3117 of my people H5971, and mine elect H0972 shall long enjoy H1086 (8762) the work H4639 of their hands H3027.
065:023 They shall not labour H3021 (8799) in vain H7385, nor bring forth H3205 (8799) for trouble H0928; for they [are] the seed H2233 of the blessed H1288 (8803) of the LORD H3068, and their offspring H6631 with them.
065:024 And it shall come to pass, that before they call H7121 (8799), I will answer H6030 (8799); and while they are yet speaking H1696 (8764), I will hear H8085 (8799).
065:025 The wolf H2061 and the lamb H2924 shall feed H7462 (8799) together H0259, and the lion H0738 shall eat H0398 (8799) straw H8401 like the bullock H1241: and dust H6083 [shall be] the serpent’s H5175 meat H3899. They shall not hurt H7489 (8686) nor destroy H7843 (8686) in all my holy H6944 mountain H2022, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
066:001 ¶  Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, The heaven H8064 [is] my throne H3678, and the earth H0776 [is] my footstool H7272 H1916: where [is] the house H1004 that ye build H1129 (8799) unto me? and where [is] the place H4725 of my rest H4496?
066:002 For all those [things] hath mine hand H3027 made H6213 (8804), and all those [things] have been, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068: but to this [man] will I look H5027 (8686), [even] to [him that is] poor H6041 and of a contrite H5223 spirit H7307, and trembleth H2730 at my word H1697.
066:003 He that killeth H7819 (8802) an ox H7794 [is as if] he slew H5221 (8688) a man H0376; he that sacrificeth H2076 (8802) a lamb H7716, [as if] he cut off H6202 a dog’s H3611 neck H6202 (8802); he that offereth H5927 (8688) an oblation H4503, [as if he offered] swine’s H2386 blood H1818; he that burneth H2142 (8688) incense H3828, [as if] he blessed H1288 (8764) an idol H0205. Yea, they have chosen H0977 (8804) their own ways H1870, and their soul H5315 delighteth H2654 (8804) in their abominations H8251.
066:004 I also will choose H0977 (8799) their delusions H8586, and will bring H0935 (8686) their fears H4035 upon them; because when I called H7121 (8804), none did answer H6030 (8802); when I spake H1696 (8765), they did not hear H8085 (8804): but they did H6213 (8799) evil H7451 before mine eyes H5869, and chose H0977 (8804) [that] in which I delighted H2654 (8804) not.
066:005 Hear H8085 (8798) the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, ye that tremble H2730 at his word H1697; Your brethren H0251 that hated H8130 (8802) you, that cast you out H5077 (8764) for my name’s H8034 sake, said H0559 (8804), Let the LORD H3068 be glorified H3513 (8799): but he shall appear H7200 (8737) to your joy H8057, and they shall be ashamed H0954 (8799).
066:006 A voice H6963 of noise H7588 from the city H5892, a voice H6963 from the temple H1964, a voice H6963 of the LORD H3068 that rendereth H7999 (8764) recompence H1576 to his enemies H0341 (8802).
066:007 Before she travailed H2342 (8799), she brought forth H3205 (8804); before her pain H2256 came H0935 (8799), she was delivered H4422 (8689) of a man child H2145.
066:008 Who hath heard H8085 (8804) such a thing? who hath seen H7200 (8804) such things? Shall the earth H0776 be made to bring forth H2342 (8714) in one H0259 day H3117? [or] shall a nation H1471 be born H3205 (8735) at once H6471? for as soon as H1571 Zion H6726 travailed H2342 (8804), she brought forth H3205 (8804) her children H1121.
066:009 Shall I bring to the birth H7665 (8686), and not cause to bring forth H3205 (8686)? saith H0559 (8799) the LORD H3068: shall I H0589 cause to bring forth H3205 (8688), and shut H6113 (8804) [the womb]? saith H0559 (8804) thy God H0430.
066:010 Rejoice H8055 (8798) ye with Jerusalem H3389, and be glad H1523 (8798) with her, all ye that love H0157 (8802) her: rejoice H7797 (8798) for joy H4885 with her, all ye that mourn H0056 (8693) for her:
066:011 That ye may suck H3243 (8799), and be satisfied H7646 (8804) with the breasts H7699 of her consolations H8575; that ye may milk out H4711 (8799), and be delighted H6026 (8694) with the abundance H2123 of her glory H3519.
066:012 For thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Behold, I will extend H5186 (8802) peace H7965 to her like a river H5104, and the glory H3519 of the Gentiles H1471 like a flowing H7857 (8802) stream H5158: then shall ye suck H3243 (8804), ye shall be borne H5375 (8735) upon [her] sides H6654, and be dandled H8173 (8746) upon [her] knees H1290.
066:013 As one H0376 whom his mother H0517 comforteth H5162 (8762), so will I comfort H5162 (8762) you; and ye shall be comforted H5162 (8792) in Jerusalem H3389.
066:014 And when ye see H7200 (8804) [this], your heart H3820 shall rejoice H7797 (8804), and your bones H6106 shall flourish H6524 (8799) like an herb H1877: and the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068 shall be known H3045 (8738) toward his servants H5650, and [his] indignation H2194 (8804) toward his enemies H0341 (8802).
066:015 For, behold, the LORD H3068 will come H0935 (8799) with fire H0784, and with his chariots H4818 like a whirlwind H5492, to render H7725 (8687) his anger H0639 with fury H2534, and his rebuke H1606 with flames H3851 of fire H0784.
066:016 For by fire H0784 and by his sword H2719 will the LORD H3068 plead H8199 (8737) with all flesh H1320: and the slain H2491 of the LORD H3068 shall be many H7231 (8804).
066:017 They that sanctify H6942 (8693) themselves, and purify H2891 (8693) themselves in the gardens H1593 behind H0310 one H0259 [tree] in the midst H8432, eating H0398 (8802) swine’s H2386 flesh H1320, and the abomination H8263, and the mouse H5909, shall be consumed H5486 (8799) together H3162, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068.
066:018 For I [know] their works H4639 and their thoughts H4284: it shall come H0935 (8802), that I will gather H6908 (8763) all nations H1471 and tongues H3956; and they shall come H0935 (8804), and see H7200 (8804) my glory H3519.
066:019 And I will set H7760 (8804) a sign H0226 among them, and I will send H7971 (8765) those that escape H6412 of them unto the nations H1471, [to] Tarshish H8659, Pul H6322, and Lud H3865, that draw H4900 (8802) the bow H7198, [to] Tubal H8422, and Javan H3120, [to] the isles H0339 afar off H7350, that have not heard H8085 (8804) my fame H8088, neither have seen H7200 (8804) my glory H3519; and they shall declare H5046 (8689) my glory H3519 among the Gentiles H1471.
066:020 And they shall bring H0935 (8689) all your brethren H0251 [for] an offering H4503 unto the LORD H3068 out of all nations H1471 upon horses H5483, and in chariots H7393, and in litters H6632, and upon mules H6505, and upon swift beasts H3753, to my holy H6944 mountain H2022 Jerusalem H3389, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, as the children H1121 of Israel H3478 bring H0935 (8686) an offering H4503 in a clean H2889 vessel H3627 into the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
066:021 And I will also take H3947 (8799) of them for priests H3548 [and] for Levites H3881, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
066:022 For as the new H2319 heavens H8064 and the new H2319 earth H0776, which I will make H6213 (8802), shall remain H5975 (8802) before H6440 me, saith H5002 (8803) the LORD H3068, so shall your seed H2233 and your name H8034 remain H5975 (8799).
066:023 And it shall come to pass, [that] from H1767 one new moon H2320 to another H2320, and from H1767 one sabbath H7676 to another H7676, shall all flesh H1320 come H0935 (8799) to worship H7812 (8692) before H6440 me, saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068.
066:024 And they shall go forth H3318 (8804), and look H7200 (8804) upon the carcases H6297 of the men H0582 that have transgressed H6586 (8802) against me: for their worm H8438 shall not die H4191 (8799), neither shall their fire H0784 be quenched H3518 (8799); and they shall be an abhorring H1860 unto all flesh H1320.
