These were reckoned by their genealogy H3187 (8692) in their villages H2691, whom H1992 David H1732 and Samuel H8050 the seer H7200 (8802) did ordain H3245 (8765) in their set office H0530.
009:023 So they and their children H1121 [had] the oversight of the gates H8179 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, [namely], the house H1004 of the tabernacle H0168, by wards H4931.
009:024 In four H0702 quarters H7307 were the porters H7778, toward the east H4217, west H3220, north H6828, and south H5045.
009:025 And their brethren H0251, [which were] in their villages H2691, [were] to come H0935 (8800) after seven H7651 days H3117 from time H6256 to time H6256 with them.
009:026 For these Levites H3881, the four H0702 chief H1368 porters H7778, were in [their] set office H0530, and were over the chambers H3957 and treasuries H0214 of the house H1004 of God H0430.
009:027 And they lodged H3885 (8799) round about H5439 the house H1004 of God H0430, because the charge H4931 [was] upon them, and the opening H4668 thereof every morning H1242 [pertained] to them.
009:028 And [certain] of them had the charge of H5921 the ministering H5656 vessels H3627, that they should bring them in H0935 (8686) and out H3318 (8686) by tale H4557 H4557.
009:029 [Some] of them also [were] appointed H4487 (8794) to oversee the vessels H3627, and all the instruments H3627 of the sanctuary H6944, and the fine flour H5560, and the wine H3196, and the oil H8081, and the frankincense H3828, and the spices H1314.
009:030 And [some] of the sons H1121 of the priests H3548 made H7543 (8802) the ointment H4842 of the spices H1314.
009:031 And Mattithiah H4993, [one] of the Levites H3881, who [was] the firstborn H1060 of Shallum H7967 the Korahite H7145, had the set office H0530 over the things that were made H4639 in the pans H2281.
009:032 And [other] of their brethren H0251, of the sons H1121 of the Kohathites H6956, [were] over the shewbread H3899 H4635, to prepare H3559 (8687) [it] every sabbath H7676.
009:033 And these [are] the singers H7891 (8789), chief H7218 of the fathers H0001 of the Levites H3881, [who remaining] in the chambers H3957 [were] free H6362 (8803) (8675) H6359: for they were employed in [that] work H4399 day H3119 and night H3915.
009:034 These chief H7218 fathers H0001 of the Levites H3881 [were] chief H7218 throughout their generations H8435; these dwelt H3427 (8804) at Jerusalem H3389.
009:035 And in Gibeon H1391 dwelt H3427 (8804) the father H0001 of Gibeon H1391 (8677) H0025, Jehiel H3273, whose wife’s H0802 name H8034 [was] Maachah H4601:
009:036 And his firstborn H1060 son H1121 Abdon H5658, then Zur H6698, and Kish H7027, and Baal H1168, and Ner H5369, and Nadab H5070,
009:037 And Gedor H1446, and Ahio H0283, and Zechariah H2148, and Mikloth H4732.
009:038 And Mikloth H4732 begat H3205 (8689) Shimeam H8043. And they also dwelt H3427 (8804) with their brethren H0251 at Jerusalem H3389, over against their brethren H0251.
009:039 And Ner H5369 begat H3205 (8689) Kish H7027; and Kish H7027 begat H3205 (8689) Saul H7586; and Saul H7586 begat H3205 (8689) Jonathan H3083, and Malchishua H4444, and Abinadab H0041, and Eshbaal H0792.
009:040 And the son H1121 of Jonathan H3083 [was] Meribbaal H4807: and Meribbaal H4810 begat H3205 (8689) Micah H4318.
009:041 And the sons H1121 of Micah H4318 [were], Pithon H6377, and Melech H4429, and Tahrea H8475, [and Ahaz].
009:042 And Ahaz H0271 begat H3205 (8689) Jarah H3294; and Jarah H3294 begat H3205 (8689) Alemeth H5964, and Azmaveth H5820, and Zimri H2174; and Zimri H2174 begat H3205 (8689) Moza H4162;
009:043 And Moza H4162 begat H3205 (8689) Binea H1150; and Rephaiah H7509 his son H1121, Eleasah H0501 his son H1121, Azel H0682 his son H1121.
009:044 And Azel H0682 had six H8337 sons H1121, whose names H8034 [are] these, Azrikam H5840, Bocheru H1074, and Ishmael H3458, and Sheariah H8187, and Obadiah H5662, and Hanan H2605: these [were] the sons H1121 of Azel H0682.
010:001 ¶  Now the Philistines H6430 fought H3898 (8738) against Israel H3478; and the men H0376 of Israel H3478 fled H5127 (8799) from before H6440 the Philistines H6430, and fell down H5307 (8799) slain H2491 in mount H2022 Gilboa H1533.
010:002 And the Philistines H6430 followed hard H1692 (8686) after H0310 Saul H7586, and after H0310 his sons H1121; and the Philistines H6430 slew H5221 (8686) Jonathan H3129, and Abinadab H0041, and Malchishua H4444, the sons H1121 of Saul H7586.
010:003 And the battle H4421 went sore H3513 (8799) against Saul H7586, and the archers H3384 (8688) H7198 hit H4672 (8799) him, and he was wounded H2342 (8799) of the archers H3384 (8802).
010:004 Then said H0559 (8799) Saul H7586 to his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627, Draw H8025 (8798) thy sword H2719, and thrust H1856 (8798) me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised H6189 come H0935 (8799) and abuse H5953 (8694) me. But his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 would H0014 (8804) not; for he was sore H3966 afraid H3372 (8804). So Saul H7586 took H3947 (8799) a sword H2719, and fell H5307 (8799) upon it.
010:005 And when his armourbearer H5375 (8802) H3627 saw H7200 (8799) that Saul H7586 was dead H4191 (8804), he fell H5307 (8799) likewise on the sword H2719, and died H4191 (8799).
010:006 So Saul H7586 died H4191 (8799), and his three H7969 sons H1121, and all his house H1004 died H4191 (8804) together H3162.
010:007 And when all the men H0376 of Israel H3478 that [were] in the valley H6010 saw H7200 (8799) that they fled H5127 (8804), and that Saul H7586 and his sons H1121 were dead H4191 (8804), then they forsook H5800 (8799) their cities H5892, and fled H5127 (8799): and the Philistines H6430 came H0935 (8799) and dwelt H3427 (8799) in them.
010:008 And it came to pass on the morrow H4283, when the Philistines H6430 came H0935 (8799) to strip H6584 (8763) the slain H2491, that they found H4672 (8799) Saul H7586 and his sons H1121 fallen H5307 (8802) in mount H2022 Gilboa H1533.
010:009 And when they had stripped H6584 (8686) him, they took H5375 (8799) his head H7218, and his armour H3627, and sent H7971 (8762) into the land H0776 of the Philistines H6430 round about H5439, to carry tidings H1319 (8763) unto their idols H6091, and to the people H5971.
010:010 And they put H7760 (8799) his armour H3627 in the house H1004 of their gods H0430, and fastened H8628 (8804) his head H1538 in the temple H1004 of Dagon H1712.
010:011 And when all Jabeshgilead H3003 H1568 heard H8085 (8799) all that the Philistines H6430 had done H6213 (8804) to Saul H7586,
010:012 They arose H6965 (8799), all the valiant H2428 men H0376, and took away H5375 (8799) the body H1480 of Saul H7586, and the bodies H1480 of his sons H1121, and brought H0935 (8686) them to Jabesh H3003, and buried H6912 (8799) their bones H6106 under the oak H0424 in Jabesh H3003, and fasted H6684 (8799) seven H7651 days H3117.
010:013 So Saul H7586 died H4191 (8799) for his transgression H4604 which he committed H4603 (8804) against the LORD H3068, [even] against the word H1697 of the LORD H3068, which he kept H8104 (8804) not, and also for asking H7592 (8800) [counsel] of [one that had] a familiar spirit H0178, to enquire H1875 (8800) [of it];
010:014 And enquired H1875 (8804) not of the LORD H3068: therefore he slew H4191 (8686) him, and turned H5437 (8686) the kingdom H4410 unto David H1732 the son H1121 of Jesse H3448.
011:001 ¶  Then all Israel H3478 gathered H6908 (8735) themselves to David H1732 unto Hebron H2275, saying H0559 (8800), Behold, we [are] thy bone H6106 and thy flesh H1320.
011:002 And moreover in time H8543 past H8032, even when Saul H7586 was king H4428, thou [wast] he that leddest out H3318 (8688) and broughtest in H0935 (8688) Israel H3478: and the LORD H3068 thy God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto thee, Thou shalt feed H7462 (8799) my people H5971 Israel H3478, and thou shalt be ruler H5057 over my people H1571 Israel H3478.
011:003 Therefore came H0935 (8799) all the elders H2205 of Israel H3478 to the king H4428 to Hebron H2275; and David H1732 made H3772 (8799) a covenant H1285 with them in Hebron H2275 before H6440 the LORD H3068; and they anointed H4886 (8799) David H1732 king H4428 over Israel H3478, according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 by H3027 Samuel H8050.
011:004 And David H1732 and all Israel H3478 went H3212 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389, which [is] Jebus H2982; where the Jebusites H2983 [were], the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776.
011:005 And the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of Jebus H2982 said H0559 (8799) to David H1732, Thou shalt not come H0935 (8799) hither. Nevertheless David H1732 took H3920 (8799) the castle H4686 of Zion H6726, which [is] the city H5892 of David H1732.
011:006 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), Whosoever smiteth H5221 (8688) the Jebusites H2983 first H7223 shall be chief H7218 and captain H8269. So Joab H3097 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 went H5927 first H7223 up H5927 (8799), and was chief H7218.
011:007 And David H1732 dwelt H3427 (8799) in the castle H4679; therefore they called H7121 (8804) it the city H5892 of David H1732.
011:008 And he built H1129 (8799) the city H5892 round about H5439, even from Millo H4407 round about H5439: and Joab H3097 repaired H2421 (8762) the rest H7605 of the city H5892.
011:009 So David H1732 waxed H3212 (8799) greater H1980 (8800) and greater H1419: for the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [was] with him.
011:010 These also [are] the chief H7218 of the mighty men H1368 whom David H1732 had, who strengthened H2388 (8693) themselves with him in his kingdom H4438, [and] with all Israel H3478, to make him king H4427 (8687), according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 concerning Israel H3478.
011:011 And this [is] the number H4557 of the mighty men H1368 whom David H1732 had; Jashobeam H3434, an Hachmonite H2453, the chief H7218 of the captains H7991 (8675) H7970: he lifted up H5782 (8790) his spear H2595 against three H7969 hundred H3967 slain H2491 [by him] at one H0259 time H6471.
011:012 And after H0310 him [was] Eleazar H0499 the son H1121 of Dodo H1734, the Ahohite H0266, who [was one] of the three H7969 mighties H1368.
011:013 He was with David H1732 at Pasdammim H6450, and there the Philistines H6430 were gathered together H0622 (8738) to battle H4421, where was a parcel H2513 of ground H7704 full H4392 of barley H8184; and the people H5971 fled H5127 (8804) from before H6440 the Philistines H6430.
011:014 And they set H3320 (8691) themselves in the midst H8432 of [that] parcel H2513, and delivered H5337 (8686) it, and slew H5221 (8686) the Philistines H6430; and the LORD H3068 saved H3467 (8686) [them] by a great H1419 deliverance H8668.
011:015 Now three H7969 of the thirty H7970 captains H7218 went down H3381 (8799) to the rock H6697 to David H1732, into the cave H4631 of Adullam H5725; and the host H4264 of the Philistines H6430 encamped H2583 (8802) in the valley H6010 of Rephaim H7497.
011:016 And David H1732 [was] then in the hold H4686, and the Philistines H6430 ’ garrison H5333 [was] then at Bethlehem H1035.
011:017 And David H1732 longed H0183 (8691), and said H0559 (8799), Oh that one would give me drink H8248 (8686) of the water H4325 of the well H0953 of Bethlehem H1035, that [is] at the gate H8179!
011:018 And the three H7969 brake through H1234 (8799) the host H4264 of the Philistines H6430, and drew H7579 (8799) water H4325 out of the well H0953 of Bethlehem H1035, that [was] by the gate H8179, and took H5375 (8799) [it], and brought H0935 (8686) [it] to David H1732: but David H1732 would H0014 (8804) not drink H8354 (8800) [of] it, but poured it out H5258 (8762) to the LORD H3068,
011:019 And said H0559 (8799), My God H0430 forbid H2486 it me, that I should do H6213 (8800) this thing H2063: shall I drink H8354 (8799) the blood H1818 of these men H0582 that have put their lives in jeopardy H5315? for with [the jeopardy of] their lives H5315 they brought H0935 (8689) it. Therefore he would H0014 (8804) not drink H8354 (8800) it. These things did H6213 (8804) these three H7969 mightiest H1368.
011:020 And Abishai H0052 the brother H0251 of Joab H3097, he was chief H7218 of the three H7969: for lifting up H5782 (8790) his spear H2595 against three H7969 hundred H3967, he slew H2491 [them], and had a name H8034 among the three H7969.
011:021 Of the three H7969, he was more honourable H3513 (8737) than the two H8147; for he was their captain H8269: howbeit he attained H0935 (8804) not to the [first] three H7969.
011:022 Benaiah H1141 the son H1121 of Jehoiada H3077, the son H1121 of a valiant H2428 man H0376 of Kabzeel H6909, who had done many H7227 acts H6467; he slew H5221 (8689) two H8147 lionlike men H0739 of Moab H4124: also he went down H3381 (8804) and slew H5221 (8689) a lion H0738 in H8432 a pit H0953 in a snowy H7950 day H3117.
011:023 And he slew H5221 (8689) an Egyptian H4713, a man H0376 of [great] stature H4060, five H2568 cubits H0520 high; and in the Egyptian’s H4713 hand H3027 [was] a spear H2595 like a weaver’s H0707 (8802) beam H4500; and he went down H3381 (8799) to him with a staff H7626, and plucked H1497 (8799) the spear H2595 out of the Egyptian’s H4713 hand H3027, and slew H2026 (8799) him with his own spear H2595.
011:024 These [things] did H6213 (8804) Benaiah H1141 the son H1121 of Jehoiada H3077, and had the name H8034 among the three H7969 mighties H1368.
011:025 Behold H2009, he was honourable H3513 (8737) among the thirty H7970, but attained H0935 (8804) not to the [first] three H7969: and David H1732 set H7760 (8799) him over his guard H4928.
011:026 Also the valiant men H1368 of the armies H2428 [were], Asahel H6214 the brother H0251 of Joab H3097, Elhanan H0445 the son H1121 of Dodo H1734 of Bethlehem H1035,

012:001 ¶  Now these [are] they that came H0935 (8802) to David H1732 to Ziklag H6860, while he yet kept himself close H6113 (8803) because H6440 of Saul H7586 the son H1121 of Kish H7027: and they [were] among the mighty men H1368, helpers H5826 (8802) of the war H4421.
012:002 [They were] armed H5401 (8802) with bows H7198, and could use both the right hand H3231 (8688) and the left H8041 (8688) in [hurling] stones H0068 and [shooting] arrows H2671 out of a bow H7198, [even] of Saul’s H7586 brethren H0251 of Benjamin H1144.
012:003 The chief H7218 [was] Ahiezer H0295, then Joash H3101, the sons H1121 of Shemaah H8094 the Gibeathite H1395; and Jeziel H3149, and Pelet H6404, the sons H1121 of Azmaveth H5820; and Berachah H1294, and Jehu H3058 the Antothite H6069,
012:004 And Ismaiah H3460 the Gibeonite H1393, a mighty man H1368 among the thirty H7970, and over the thirty H7970; and Jeremiah H3414, and Jahaziel H3166, and Johanan H3110, and Josabad H3107 the Gederathite H1452,
012:005 Eluzai H0498, and Jerimoth H3406, and Bealiah H1183, and Shemariah H8114, and Shephatiah H8203 the Haruphite H2741,
012:006 Elkanah H0511, and Jesiah H3449, and Azareel H5832, and Joezer H3134, and Jashobeam H3434, the Korhites H7145,
012:007 And Joelah H3132, and Zebadiah H2069, the sons H1121 of Jeroham H3395 of Gedor H1446.
012:008 And of the Gadites H1425 there separated H0914 (8738) themselves unto David H1732 into the hold H4679 to the wilderness H4057 men H1368 of might H2428, [and] men H0582 of war H6635 [fit] for the battle H4421, that could handle H6186 (8802) shield H6793 and buckler H7420, whose faces H6440 [were like] the faces H6440 of lions H0738, and [were] as swift H4116 (8763) as the roes H6643 upon the mountains H2022;
012:009 Ezer H5829 the first H7218, Obadiah H5662 the second H8145, Eliab H0446 the third H7992,
012:010 Mishmannah H4925 the fourth H7243, Jeremiah H3414 the fifth H2549,
012:011 Attai H6262 the sixth H8345, Eliel H0447 the seventh H7637,
012:012 Johanan H3110 the eighth H8066, Elzabad H0443 the ninth H8671,
012:013 Jeremiah H3414 the tenth H6224, Machbanai H4344 the eleventh H6249 H6240.
012:014 These [were] of the sons H1121 of Gad H1410, captains H7218 of the host H6635: one H0259 of the least H6996 [was] over an hundred H3967, and the greatest H1419 over a thousand H0505.
012:015 These [are] they that went over H5674 (8804) Jordan H3383 in the first H7223 month H2320, when it had overflown H4390 (8764) all his banks H1415 (8675) H1428; and they put to flight H1272 (8686) all [them] of the valleys H6010, [both] toward the east H4217, and toward the west H4628.
012:016 And there came H0935 (8799) of the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144 and Judah H3063 to the hold H4679 unto David H1732.
012:017 And David H1732 went out H3318 (8799) to meet H6440 them, and answered H6030 (8799) and said H0559 (8799) unto them, If ye be come H0935 (8804) peaceably H7965 unto me to help H5826 (8800) me, mine heart H3824 shall be knit H3162 unto you: but if [ye be come] to betray H7411 (8763) me to mine enemies H6862, seeing [there is] no H3808 wrong H2555 in mine hands H3709, the God H0430 of our fathers H0001 look H7200 (8799) [thereon], and rebuke H3198 (8686) [it].
012:018 Then the spirit H7307 came H3847 (8804) upon Amasai H6022, [who was] chief H7218 of the captains H7970 (8677) H7991, [and he said], Thine [are we], David H1732, and on thy side, thou son H1121 of Jesse H3448: peace H7965, peace H7965 [be] unto thee, and peace H7965 [be] to thine helpers H5826 (8802); for thy God H0430 helpeth H5826 (8804) thee. Then David H1732 received H6901 (8762) them, and made H5414 (8799) them captains H7218 of the band H1416.
012:019 And there fell H5307 (8804) [some] of Manasseh H4519 to David H1732, when he came H0935 (8800) with the Philistines H6430 against Saul H7586 to battle H4421: but they helped H5826 (8804) them not: for the lords H5633 of the Philistines H6430 upon advisement H6098 sent H7971 (8765) him away, saying H0559 (8800), He will fall H5307 (8799) to his master H0113 Saul H7586 to [the jeopardy of] our heads H7218.
012:020 As he went H3212 (8800) to Ziklag H6860, there fell H5307 (8804) to him of Manasseh H4519, Adnah H5734, and Jozabad H3107, and Jediael H3043, and Michael H4317, and Jozabad H3107, and Elihu H0453, and Zilthai H6769, captains H7218 of the thousands H0505 that [were] of Manasseh H4519.
012:021 And they helped H5826 (8804) David H1732 against the band H1416 [of the rovers]: for they [were] all mighty men H1368 of valour H2428, and were captains H8269 in the host H6635.
012:022 For at [that] time H6256 day H3117 by day H3117 there came H0935 (8799) to David H1732 to help H5826 (8800) him, until [it was] a great H1419 host H4264, like the host H4264 of God H0430.
012:023 And these [are] the numbers H4557 of the bands H7218 [that were] ready armed H2502 (8803) to the war H6635, [and] came H0935 (8804) to David H1732 to Hebron H2275, to turn H5437 (8687) the kingdom H4438 of Saul H7586 to him, according to the word H6310 of the LORD H3068.
012:024 The children H1121 of Judah H3063 that bare H5375 (8802) shield H6793 and spear H7420 [were] six H8337 thousand H0505 and eight H8083 hundred H3967, ready armed H2502 (8803) to the war H6635.
012:025 Of the children H1121 of Simeon H8095, mighty men H1368 of valour H2428 for the war H6635, seven H7651 thousand H0505 and one hundred H3967.
012:026 Of the children H1121 of Levi H3878 four H0702 thousand H0505 and six H8337 hundred H3967.
012:027 And Jehoiada H3077 [was] the leader H5057 of the Aaronites H0175, and with him [were] three H7969 thousand H0505 and seven H7651 hundred H3967;
012:028 And Zadok H6659, a young man H5288 mighty H1368 of valour H2428, and of his father’s H0001 house H1004 twenty H6242 and two H8147 captains H8269.
012:029 And of the children H1121 of Benjamin H1144, the kindred H0251 of Saul H7586, three H7969 thousand H0505: for hitherto the greatest H4768 part of them had kept H8104 (8802) the ward H4931 of the house H1004 of Saul H7586.
012:030 And of the children H1121 of Ephraim H0669 twenty H6242 thousand H0505 and eight H8083 hundred H3967, mighty H1368 men H0582 of valour H2428, famous H8034 throughout the house H1004 of their fathers H0001.
012:031 And of the half H2677 tribe H4294 of Manasseh H4519 eighteen H8083 H6240 thousand H0505, which were expressed H5344 (8738) by name H8034, to come H0935 (8800) and make David H1732 king H4427 (8687).
012:032 And of the children H1121 of Issachar H3485, [which were men] that had understanding H0998 H3045 (8802) of the times H6256, to know H3045 (8800) what Israel H3478 ought to do H6213 (8799); the heads H7218 of them [were] two hundred H3967; and all their brethren H0251 [were] at their commandment H6310.
012:033 Of Zebulun H2074, such as went forth H3318 (8802) to battle H6635, expert H6186 (8802) in war H4421, with all instruments H3627 of war H4421, fifty H2572 thousand H0505, which could keep rank H5737 (8800): [they were] not of double H3820 heart H3820.
012:034 And of Naphtali H5321 a thousand H0505 captains H8269, and with them with shield H6793 and spear H2595 thirty H7970 and seven H7651 thousand H0505.
012:035 And of the Danites H1839 expert H6186 (8802) in war H4421 twenty H6242 and eight H8083 thousand H0505 and six H8337 hundred H3967.
012:036 And of Asher H0836, such as went forth H3318 (8802) to battle H6635, expert H6186 (8800) in war H4421, forty H0705 thousand H0505.
012:037 And on the other side H5676 of Jordan H3383, of the Reubenites H7206, and the Gadites H1425, and of the half H2677 tribe H7626 of Manasseh H4519, with all manner of instruments H3627 of war H6635 for the battle H4421, an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505.
012:038 All these men H0582 of war H4421, that could keep H5737 (8802) rank H4634, came H0935 (8804) with a perfect H8003 heart H3820 to Hebron H2275, to make David H1732 king H4427 (8687) over all Israel H3478: and all the rest H7611 also of Israel H3478 [were] of one H0259 heart H3824 to make David H1732 king H4427 (8687).
012:039 And there they were with David H1732 three H7969 days H3117, eating H0398 (8802) and drinking H8354 (8802): for their brethren H0251 had prepared H3559 (8689) for them.
012:040 Moreover they that were nigh H7138 them, [even] unto Issachar H3485 and Zebulun H2074 and Naphtali H5321, brought H0935 (8688) bread H3899 on asses H2543, and on camels H1581, and on mules H6505, and on oxen H1241, [and] meat H3978, meal H7058, cakes H1690 of figs, and bunches of raisins H6778, and wine H3196, and oil H8081, and oxen H1241, and sheep H6629 abundantly H7230: for [there was] joy H8057 in Israel H3478.
013:001 ¶  And David H1732 consulted H3289 (8735) with the captains H8269 of thousands H0505 and hundreds H3967, [and] with every leader H5057.
013:002 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto all the congregation H6951 of Israel H3478, If [it seem] good H2895 (8804) unto you, and [that it be] of the LORD H3068 our God H0430, let us send H7971 (8799) abroad H6555 (8799) unto our brethren H0251 every where, [that are] left H7604 (8737) in all the land H0776 of Israel H3478, and with them [also] to the priests H3548 and Levites H3881 [which are] in their cities H5892 [and] suburbs H4054, that they may gather H6908 (8735) themselves unto us:
013:003 And let us bring again H5437 (8686) the ark H0727 of our God H0430 to us: for we enquired H1875 (8804) not at it in the days H3117 of Saul H7586.
013:004 And all the congregation H6951 said H0559 (8799) that they would do so H6213 (8800): for the thing H1697 was right H3474 (8804) in the eyes H5869 of all the people H5971.
013:005 So David H1732 gathered H6950 all Israel H3478 together H6950 (8686), from Shihor H7883 of Egypt H4714 even unto the entering H0935 (8800) of Hemath H2574, to bring H0935 (8687) the ark H0727 of God H0430 from Kirjathjearim H7157.
013:006 And David H1732 went up H5927 (8799), and all Israel H3478, to Baalah H1173, [that is], to Kirjathjearim H7157, which [belonged] to Judah H3063, to bring up H5927 (8687) thence the ark H0727 of God H0430 the LORD H3068, that dwelleth H3427 (8802) [between] the cherubims H3742, whose name H8034 is called H7121 (8738) [on it].
013:007 And they carried H7392 (8686) the ark H0727 of God H0430 in a new H2319 cart H5699 out of the house H1004 of Abinadab H0041: and Uzza H5798 and Ahio H0283 drave H5090 (8802) the cart H5699.
013:008 And David H1732 and all Israel H3478 played H7832 (8764) before H6440 God H0430 with all [their] might H5797, and with singing H7892, and with harps H3658, and with psalteries H5035, and with timbrels H8596, and with cymbals H4700, and with trumpets H2689.
013:009 And when they came H0935 (8799) unto the threshingfloor H1637 of Chidon H3592, Uzza H5798 put forth H7971 (8799) his hand H3027 to hold H0270 (8800) the ark H0727; for the oxen H1241 stumbled H8058 (8804).
013:010 And the anger H0639 of the LORD H3068 was kindled H2734 (8799) against Uzza H5798, and he smote H5221 (8686) him, because he put H7971 (8804) his hand H3027 to the ark H0727: and there he died H4191 (8799) before H6440 God H0430.
013:011 And David H1732 was displeased H2734 (8799), because the LORD H3068 had made H6555 (8804) a breach H6556 upon Uzza H5798: wherefore that place H4725 is called H7121 (8799) Perezuzza H6560 to this day H3117.
013:012 And David H1732 was afraid H3372 (8799) of God H0430 that day H3117, saying H0559 (8800), How H1963 shall I bring H0935 (8686) the ark H0727 of God H0430 [home] to me?
013:013 So David H1732 brought H5493 (8689) not the ark H0727 [home] to himself to the city H5892 of David H1732, but carried it aside H5186 (8686) into the house H1004 of Obededom H5654 the Gittite H1663.
013:014 And the ark H0727 of God H0430 remained H3427 (8799) with the family H1004 of Obededom H5654 in his house H1004 three H7969 months H2320. And the LORD H3068 blessed H1288 (8762) the house H1004 of Obededom H5654, and all that he had.
014:001 ¶  Now Hiram H2438 (8676) H2361 king H4428 of Tyre H6865 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to David H1732, and timber H6086 of cedars H0730, with masons H7023 and carpenters H2796, to build H1129 (8800) him an house H1004.
014:002 And David H1732 perceived H3045 (8799) that the LORD H3068 had confirmed H3559 (8689) him king H4428 over Israel H3478, for his kingdom H4438 was lifted up H5375 (8738) on high H4605, because of his people H5971 Israel H3478.
014:003 And David H1732 took H3947 (8799) more wives H0802 at Jerusalem H3389: and David H1732 begat H3205 (8686) more sons H1121 and daughters H1323.
014:004 Now these [are] the names H8034 of [his] children H3205 (8803) which he had in Jerusalem H3389; Shammua H8051, and Shobab H7727, Nathan H5416, and Solomon H8010,
014:005 And Ibhar H2984, and Elishua H0474, and Elpalet H0467,
014:006 And Nogah H5052, and Nepheg H5298, and Japhia H3309,
014:007 And Elishama H0476, and Beeliada H1182, and Eliphalet H0467.
014:008 And when the Philistines H6430 heard H8085 (8799) that David H1732 was anointed H4886 (8738) king H4428 over all Israel H3478, all the Philistines H6430 went up H5927 (8799) to seek H1245 (8763) David H1732. And David H1732 heard H8085 (8799) [of it], and went out H3318 (8799) against H6440 them.
014:009 And the Philistines H6430 came H0935 (8804) and spread H6584 (8799) themselves in the valley H6010 of Rephaim H7497.
014:010 And David H1732 enquired H7592 (8799) of God H0430, saying H0559 (8800), Shall I go up H5927 (8799) against the Philistines H6430? and wilt thou deliver H5414 (8804) them into mine hand H3027? And the LORD H3068 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go up H5927 (8798); for I will deliver H5414 (8804) them into thine hand H3027.
014:011 So they came up H5927 (8799) to Baalperazim H1188; and David H1732 smote H5221 (8686) them there. Then David H1732 said H0559 (8799), God H0430 hath broken in H6555 (8804) upon mine enemies H0341 (8802) by mine hand H3027 like the breaking forth H6556 of waters H4325: therefore they called H7121 (8804) the name H8034 of that place H4725 Baalperazim H1188.
014:012 And when they had left H5800 (8799) their gods H0430 there, David H1732 gave a commandment H0559 (8799), and they were burned H8313 (8735) with fire H0784.
014:013 And the Philistines H6430 yet again H3254 (8686) spread themselves abroad H6584 (8799) in the valley H6010.
014:014 Therefore David H1732 enquired H7592 (8799) again of God H0430; and God H0430 said H0559 (8799) unto him, Go not up H5927 (8799) after H0310 them; turn away H5437 (8685) from them, and come H0935 (8804) upon them over against H4136 the mulberry trees H1057.
014:015 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear H8085 (8800) a sound H6963 of going H6807 in the tops H7218 of the mulberry trees H1057, [that] then thou shalt go out H3318 (8799) to battle H4421: for God H0430 is gone forth H3318 (8804) before H6440 thee to smite H5221 (8687) the host H4264 of the Philistines H6430.
014:016 David H1732 therefore did H6213 (8799) as God H0430 commanded H6680 (8765) him: and they smote H5221 (8686) the host H4264 of the Philistines H6430 from Gibeon H1391 even to Gazer H1507.
014:017 And the fame H8034 of David H1732 went out H3318 (8799) into all lands H0776; and the LORD H3068 brought H5414 (8804) the fear H6343 of him upon all nations H1471.
015:001 ¶  And [David] made H6213 (8799) him houses H1004 in the city H5892 of David H1732, and prepared H3559 (8686) a place H4725 for the ark H0727 of God H0430, and pitched H5186 (8799) for it a tent H0168.
015:002 Then David H1732 said H0559 (8804), None ought to carry H5375 (8800) the ark H0727 of God H0430 but the Levites H3881: for them hath the LORD H3068 chosen H0977 (8804) to carry H5375 (8800) the ark H0727 of God H0430, and to minister H8334 (8763) unto him for H5704 ever H5769.
015:003 And David H1732 gathered H6950 all Israel H3478 together H6950 (8686) to Jerusalem H3389, to bring up H5927 (8687) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 unto his place H4725, which he had prepared H3559 (8689) for it.
015:004 And David H1732 assembled H0622 (8799) the children H1121 of Aaron H0175, and the Levites H3881:
015:005 Of the sons H1121 of Kohath H6955; Uriel H0222 the chief H8269, and his brethren H0251 an hundred H3967 and twenty H6242:
015:006 Of the sons H1121 of Merari H4847; Asaiah H6222 the chief H8269, and his brethren H0251 two hundred H3967 and twenty H6242:
015:007 Of the sons H1121 of Gershom H1647; Joel H3100 the chief H8269, and his brethren H0251 an hundred H3967 and thirty H7970:
015:008 Of the sons H1121 of Elizaphan H0469; Shemaiah H8098 the chief H8269, and his brethren H0251 two hundred H3967:
015:009 Of the sons H1121 of Hebron H2275; Eliel H0447 the chief H8269, and his brethren H0251 fourscore H8084:
015:010 Of the sons H1121 of Uzziel H5816; Amminadab H5992 the chief H8269, and his brethren H0251 an hundred H3967 and twelve H8147 H6240.
015:011 And David H1732 called H7121 (8799) for Zadok H6659 and Abiathar H0054 the priests H3548, and for the Levites H3881, for Uriel H0222, Asaiah H6222, and Joel H3100, Shemaiah H8098, and Eliel H0447, and Amminadab H5992,
015:012 And said H0559 (8799) unto them, Ye [are] the chief H7218 of the fathers H0001 of the Levites H3881: sanctify H6942 (8690) yourselves, [both] ye and your brethren H0251, that ye may bring up H5927 (8689) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 unto [the place that] I have prepared H3559 (8689) for it.
015:013 For because ye [did it] not at the first H7223, the LORD H3068 our God H0430 made a breach H6555 (8804) upon us, for that we sought H1875 (8804) him not after the due order H4941.
015:014 So the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881 sanctified H6942 (8691) themselves to bring up H5927 (8687) the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
015:015 And the children H1121 of the Levites H3881 bare H5375 (8799) the ark H0727 of God H0430 upon their shoulders H3802 with the staves H4133 thereon, as Moses H4872 commanded H6680 (8765) according to the word H1697 of the LORD H3068.
015:016 And David H1732 spake H0559 (8799) to the chief H8269 of the Levites H3881 to appoint H5975 (8687) their brethren H0251 [to be] the singers H7891 (8789) with instruments H3627 of musick H7892, psalteries H5035 and harps H3658 and cymbals H4700, sounding H8085 (8688), by lifting up H7311 (8687) the voice H6963 with joy H8057.
015:017 So the Levites H3881 appointed H5975 (8686) Heman H1968 the son H1121 of Joel H3100; and of his brethren H0251, Asaph H0623 the son H1121 of Berechiah H1296; and of the sons H1121 of Merari H4847 their brethren H0251, Ethan H0387 the son H1121 of Kushaiah H6984;
015:018 And with them their brethren H0251 of the second H4932 [degree], Zechariah H2148, Ben H1122, and Jaaziel H3268, and Shemiramoth H8070, and Jehiel H3171, and Unni H6042, Eliab H0446, and Benaiah H1141, and Maaseiah H4641, and Mattithiah H4993, and Elipheleh H0466, and Mikneiah H4737, and Obededom H5654, and Jeiel H3273, the porters H7778.
015:019 So the singers H7891 (8789), Heman H1968, Asaph H0623, and Ethan H0387, [were appointed] to sound H8085 (8687) with cymbals H4700 of brass H5178;
015:020 And Zechariah H2148, and Aziel H5815, and Shemiramoth H8070, and Jehiel H3171, and Unni H6042, and Eliab H0446, and Maaseiah H4641, and Benaiah H1141, with psalteries H5035 on Alamoth H5961;
015:021 And Mattithiah H4993, and Elipheleh H0466, and Mikneiah H4737, and Obededom H5654, and Jeiel H3273, and Azaziah H5812, with harps H3658 on the Sheminith H8067 to excel H5329 (8763).
015:022 And Chenaniah H3663, chief H8269 of the Levites H3881, [was] for song H4853: he instructed H3256 about the song H4853, because he [was] skilful H0995 (8688).
015:023 And Berechiah H1296 and Elkanah H0511 [were] doorkeepers H7778 for the ark H0727.
015:024 And Shebaniah H7645, and Jehoshaphat H3146, and Nethaneel H5417, and Amasai H6022, and Zechariah H2148, and Benaiah H1141, and Eliezer H0461, the priests H3548, did blow H2690 (8688) (8675) H2690 (8764) with the trumpets H2689 before H6440 the ark H0727 of God H0430: and Obededom H5654 and Jehiah H3174 [were] doorkeepers H7778 for the ark H0727.
015:025 So David H1732, and the elders H2205 of Israel H3478, and the captains H8269 over thousands H0505, went H1980 (8802) to bring up H5927 (8687) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 out of the house H1004 of Obededom H5654 with joy H8057.
015:026 And it came to pass, when God H0430 helped H5826 (8800) the Levites H3881 that bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, that they offered H2076 (8799) seven H7651 bullocks H6499 and seven H7651 rams H0352.
015:027 And David H1732 [was] clothed H3736 (8794) with a robe H4598 of fine linen H0948, and all the Levites H3881 that bare H5375 (8802) the ark H0727, and the singers H7891 (8789), and Chenaniah H3663 the master H8269 of the song H4853 with the singers H7891 (8789): David H1732 also [had] upon him an ephod H0646 of linen H0906.
015:028 Thus all Israel H3478 brought up H5927 (8688) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 with shouting H8643, and with sound H6963 of the cornet H7782, and with trumpets H2689, and with cymbals H4700, making a noise H8085 (8688) with psalteries H5035 and harps H3658.
015:029 And it came to pass, [as] the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 came H0935 (8804) to the city H5892 of David H1732, that Michal H4324 the daughter H1323 of Saul H7586 looking out H8259 (8738) at a window H2474 saw H7200 (8799) king H4428 David H1732 dancing H7540 (8764) and playing H7832 (8764): and she despised H0959 (8799) him in her heart H3820.
016:001 ¶  So they brought H0935 (8686) the ark H0727 of God H0430, and set H3322 (8686) it in the midst H8432 of the tent H0168 that David H1732 had pitched H5186 (8804) for it: and they offered H7126 (8686) burnt sacrifices H5930 and peace offerings H8002 before H6440 God H0430.
016:002 And when David H1732 had made an end H3615 (8762) of offering H5927 (8687) the burnt offerings H5930 and the peace offerings H8002, he blessed H1288 (8762) the people H5971 in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
016:003 And he dealt H2505 (8762) to every one H0376 of Israel H3478, both man H0376 and woman H0802, to every one H0376 a loaf H3603 of bread H3899, and a good piece of flesh H0829, and a flagon H0809 [of wine].
016:004 And he appointed H5414 (8799) [certain] of the Levites H3881 to minister H8334 (8764) before H6440 the ark H0727 of the LORD H3068, and to record H2142 (8687), and to thank H3034 (8687) and praise H1984 (8763) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478:
016:005 Asaph H0623 the chief H7218, and next H4932 to him Zechariah H2148, Jeiel H3273, and Shemiramoth H8070, and Jehiel H3171, and Mattithiah H4993, and Eliab H0446, and Benaiah H1141, and Obededom H5654: and Jeiel H3273 with psalteries H5035 H3627 and with harps H3658; but Asaph H0623 made a sound H8085 (8688) with cymbals H4700;
016:006 Benaiah H1141 also and Jahaziel H3166 the priests H3548 with trumpets H2689 continually H8548 before H6440 the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of God H0430.
016:007 Then on that day H3117 David H1732 delivered H5414 (8804) first H7218 [this psalm] to thank H3034 (8687) the LORD H3068 into the hand H3027 of Asaph H0623 and his brethren H0251.
016:008 Give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the LORD H3068, call H7121 (8798) upon his name H8034, make known H3045 (8685) his deeds H5949 among the people H5971.
016:009 Sing H7891 (8798) unto him, sing psalms H2167 (8761) unto him, talk H7878 (8798) ye of all his wondrous H6381 (8737) works.
016:010 Glory H1984 (8690) ye in his holy H6944 name H8034: let the heart H3820 of them rejoice H8055 (8799) that seek H1245 (8764) the LORD H3068.
016:011 Seek H1875 (8798) the LORD H3068 and his strength H5797, seek H1245 (8761) his face H6440 continually H8548.
016:012 Remember H2142 (8798) his marvellous H6381 (8737) works that he hath done H6213 (8804), his wonders H4159, and the judgments H4941 of his mouth H6310;
016:013 O ye seed H2233 of Israel H3478 his servant H5650, ye children H1121 of Jacob H3290, his chosen ones H0972.
016:014 He [is] the LORD H3068 our God H0430; his judgments H4941 [are] in all the earth H0776.
016:015 Be ye mindful H2142 (8798) always H5769 of his covenant H1285; the word H1697 [which] he commanded H6680 (8765) to a thousand H0505 generations H1755;
016:016 [Even of the covenant] which he made H3772 (8804) with Abraham H0085, and of his oath H7621 unto Isaac H3327;
016:017 And hath confirmed H5975 (8686) the same to Jacob H3290 for a law H2706, [and] to Israel H3478 [for] an everlasting H5769 covenant H1285,
016:018 Saying H0559 (8800), Unto thee will I give H5414 (8799) the land H0776 of Canaan H3667, the lot H2256 of your inheritance H5159;
016:019 When ye were but few H4557 H4962, even a few H4592, and strangers H1481 (8802) in it.
016:020 And [when] they went H1980 (8691) from nation H1471 to nation H1471, and from [one] kingdom H4467 to another H0312 people H5971;
016:021 He suffered H3240 (8689) no man H0376 to do them wrong H6231 (8800): yea, he reproved H3198 (8686) kings H4428 for their sakes,
016:022 [Saying], Touch H5060 (8799) not mine anointed H4899, and do my prophets H5030 no harm H7489 (8686).
016:023 Sing H7891 (8798) unto the LORD H3068, all the earth H0776; shew forth H1319 (8761) from day H3117 to day H3117 his salvation H3444.
016:024 Declare H5608 (8761) his glory H3519 among the heathen H1471; his marvellous works H6381 (8737) among all nations H5971.
016:025 For great H1419 [is] the LORD H3068, and greatly H3966 to be praised H1984 (8794): he also [is] to be feared H3372 (8737) above all gods H0430.
016:026 For all the gods H0430 of the people H5971 [are] idols H0457: but the LORD H3068 made H6213 (8804) the heavens H8064.
016:027 Glory H1935 and honour H1926 [are] in his presence H6440; strength H5797 and gladness H2304 [are] in his place H4725.
016:028 Give H3051 (8798) unto the LORD H3068, ye kindreds H4940 of the people H5971, give H3051 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 glory H3519 and strength H5797.
016:029 Give H3051 (8798) unto the LORD H3068 the glory H3519 [due] unto his name H8034: bring H5375 (8798) an offering H4503, and come H0935 (8798) before H6440 him: worship H7812 (8690) the LORD H3068 in the beauty H1927 of holiness H6944.
016:030 Fear H2342 (8798) before H6440 him, all the earth H0776: the world H8398 also shall be stable H3559 (8735), that it be not moved H4131 (8735).
016:031 Let the heavens H8064 be glad H8055 (8799), and let the earth H0776 rejoice H1523 (8799): and let [men] say H0559 (8799) among the nations H1471, The LORD H3068 reigneth H4427 (8804).
016:032 Let the sea H3220 roar H7481 (8799), and the fulness H4393 thereof: let the fields H7704 rejoice H5970 (8799), and all that [is] therein.
016:033 Then shall the trees H6086 of the wood H3293 sing out H7442 (8762) at the presence H6440 of the LORD H3068, because he cometh H0935 (8804) to judge H8199 (8800) the earth H0776.
016:034 O give thanks H3034 (8685) unto the LORD H3068; for [he is] good H2896; for his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769.
016:035 And say H0559 (8798) ye, Save H3467 (8685) us, O God H0430 of our salvation H3468, and gather us together H6908 (8761), and deliver H5337 (8685) us from the heathen H1471, that we may give thanks H3034 (8687) to thy holy H6944 name H8034, [and] glory H7623 (8692) in thy praise H8416.
016:036 Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 for ever H5769 and ever H5769. And all the people H5971 said H0559 (8799), Amen H0543, and praised H1984 (8763) the LORD H3068.
016:037 So he left H5800 (8799) there before H6440 the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 Asaph H0623 and his brethren H0251, to minister H8334 (8763) before H6440 the ark H0727 continually H8548, as every day’s H3117 work H1697 required H3117:
016:038 And Obededom H5654 with their brethren H0251, threescore H8346 and eight H8083; Obededom H5654 also the son H1121 of Jeduthun H3038 and Hosah H2621 [to be] porters H7778:
016:039 And Zadok H6659 the priest H3548, and his brethren H0251 the priests H3548, before H6440 the tabernacle H4908 of the LORD H3068 in the high place H1116 that [was] at Gibeon H1391,
016:040 To offer H5927 (8687) burnt offerings H5930 unto the LORD H3068 upon the altar H4196 of the burnt offering H5930 continually H8548 morning H1242 and evening H6153, and [to do] according to all that is written H3789 (8803) in the law H8451 of the LORD H3068, which he commanded H6680 (8765) Israel H3478;
016:041 And with them Heman H1968 and Jeduthun H3038, and the rest H7605 that were chosen H1305 (8803), who were expressed H5344 (8738) by name H8034, to give thanks H3034 (8687) to the LORD H3068, because his mercy H2617 [endureth] for ever H5769;
016:042 And with them Heman H1968 and Jeduthun H3038 with trumpets H2689 and cymbals H4700 for those that should make a sound H8085 (8688), and with musical H7892 instruments H3627 of God H0430. And the sons H1121 of Jeduthun H3038 [were] porters H8179.
016:043 And all the people H5971 departed H3212 (8799) every man H0376 to his house H1004: and David H1732 returned H5437 (8735) to bless H1288 (8763) his house H1004.
017:001 ¶  Now it came to pass, as David H1732 sat H3427 (8804) in his house H1004, that David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Nathan H5416 the prophet H5030, Lo, I dwell H3427 (8802) in an house H1004 of cedars H0730, but the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068 [remaineth] under curtains H3407.
017:002 Then Nathan H5416 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Do H6213 (8798) all that [is] in thine heart H3824; for God H0430 [is] with thee.
017:003 And it came to pass the same night H3915, that the word H1697 of God H0430 came to Nathan H5416, saying H0559 (8800),
017:004 Go H3212 (8798) and tell H0559 (8804) David H1732 my servant H5650, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Thou shalt not build H1129 (8799) me an house H1004 to dwell in H3427 (8800):
017:005 For I have not dwelt in H3427 (8804) an house H1004 since the day H3117 that I brought up H5927 (8689) Israel H3478 unto this day H3117; but have gone from tent H0168 to tent H0168, and from [one] tabernacle H4908 [to another].
017:006 Wheresoever I have walked H1980 (8694) with all Israel H3478, spake H1696 (8765) I a word H1697 to any H0259 of the judges H8199 (8802) of Israel H3478, whom I commanded H6680 (8765) to feed H7462 (8800) my people H5971, saying H0559 (8800), Why have ye not built H1129 (8804) me an house H1004 of cedars H0730?
017:007 Now therefore thus shalt thou say H0559 (8799) unto my servant H5650 David H1732, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068 of hosts H6635, I took H3947 (8804) thee from the sheepcote H5116, [even] from following H0310 the sheep H6629, that thou shouldest be ruler H5057 over my people H5971 Israel H3478:
017:008 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked H1980 (8804), and have cut off H3772 (8686) all thine enemies H0341 (8802) from before H6440 thee, and have made H6213 (8804) thee a name H8034 like the name H8034 of the great men H1419 that [are] in the earth H0776.
017:009 Also I will ordain H7760 (8804) a place H4725 for my people H5971 Israel H3478, and will plant H5193 (8804) them, and they shall dwell H7931 (8804) in their place, and shall be moved H7264 (8799) no more; neither shall the children H1121 of wickedness H5766 waste H1086 (8763) them any more H3254 (8686), as at the beginning H7223,
017:010 And since the time H3117 that I commanded H6680 (8765) judges H8199 (8802) [to be] over my people H5971 Israel H3478. Moreover I will subdue H3665 (8689) all thine enemies H0341 (8802). Furthermore I tell H5046 (8686) thee that the LORD H3068 will build H1129 (8799) thee an house H1004.
017:011 And it shall come to pass, when thy days H3117 be expired H4390 (8804) that thou must go H3212 (8800) [to be] with thy fathers H0001, that I will raise up H6965 (8689) thy seed H2233 after H0310 thee, which shall be of thy sons H1121; and I will establish H3559 (8689) his kingdom H4438.
017:012 He shall build H1129 (8799) me an house H1004, and I will stablish H3559 (8790) his throne H3678 for H5704 ever H5769.
017:013 I will be his father H0001, and he shall be my son H1121: and I will not take H5493 my mercy H2617 away H5493 (8686) from him, as I took H5493 (8689) [it] from [him] that was before H6440 thee:
017:014 But I will settle H5975 (8689) him in mine house H1004 and in my kingdom H4438 for ever H5769: and his throne H3678 shall be established H3559 (8737) for H5704 evermore H5769.
017:015 According to all these words H1697, and according to all this vision H2377, so did Nathan H5416 speak H1696 (8765) unto David H1732.
017:016 And David H1732 the king H4428 came H0935 (8799) and sat H3427 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and said H0559 (8799), Who [am] I, O LORD H3068 God H0430, and what [is] mine house H1004, that thou hast brought H0935 (8689) me hitherto H1988?
017:017 And [yet] this was a small thing H6994 (8799) in thine eyes H5869, O God H0430; for thou hast [also] spoken H1696 (8762) of thy servant’s H5650 house H1004 for a great while to come H7350, and hast regarded H7200 (8804) me according to the estate H8448 of a man H0120 of high degree H4609, O LORD H3068 God H0430.
017:018 What can H3254 David H1732 [speak] more H3254 (8686) to thee for the honour H3519 of thy servant H5650? for thou knowest H3045 (8804) thy servant H5650.
017:019 O LORD H3068, for thy servant’s H5650 sake, and according to thine own heart H3820, hast thou done H6213 (8804) all this greatness H1420, in making known H3045 (8687) all [these] great things H1420.
017:020 O LORD H3068, [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God H0430 beside H2108 thee, according to all that we have heard H8085 (8804) with our ears H0241.
017:021 And what one H0259 nation H1471 in the earth H0776 [is] like thy people H5971 Israel H3478, whom God H0430 went H1980 (8804) to redeem H6299 (8800) [to be] his own people H5971, to make H7760 (8800) thee a name H8034 of greatness H1420 and terribleness H3372 (8737), by driving out H1644 (8763) nations H1471 from before H6440 thy people H5971, whom thou hast redeemed H6299 (8804) out of Egypt H4714?
017:022 For thy people H5971 Israel H3478 didst thou make H5414 (8799) thine own people H5971 for H5704 ever H5769; and thou, LORD H3068, becamest their God H0430.
017:023 Therefore now, LORD H3068, let the thing H1697 that thou hast spoken H1696 (8765) concerning thy servant H5650 and concerning his house H1004 be established H0539 (8735) for H5704 ever H5769, and do H6213 (8798) as thou hast said H1696 (8765).
017:024 Let it even be established H0539 (8735), that thy name H8034 may be magnified H1431 (8799) for H5704 ever H5769, saying H0559 (8800), The LORD H3068 of hosts H6635 [is] the God H0430 of Israel H3478, [even] a God H0430 to Israel H3478: and [let] the house H1004 of David H1732 thy servant H5650 [be] established H3559 (8737) before H6440 thee.
017:025 For thou, O my God H0430, hast told H1540 (8804) H0241 thy servant H5650 that thou wilt build H1129 (8800) him an house H1004: therefore thy servant H5650 hath found H4672 (8804) [in his heart] to pray H6419 (8692) before H6440 thee.
017:026 And now, LORD H3068, thou art God H0430, and hast promised H1696 (8762) this goodness H2896 unto thy servant H5650:
017:027 Now therefore let it please H2974 (8689) thee to bless H1288 (8763) the house H1004 of thy servant H5650, that it may be before H6440 thee for ever H5769: for thou blessest H1288 (8765), O LORD H3068, and [it shall be] blessed H1288 (8794) for ever H5769.
018:001 ¶  Now after this H0310 it came to pass, that David H1732 smote H5221 (8686) the Philistines H6430, and subdued H3665 (8686) them, and took H3947 (8799) Gath H1661 and her towns H1323 out of the hand H3027 of the Philistines H6430.
018:002 And he smote H5221 (8686) Moab H4124; and the Moabites H4124 became David’s H1732 servants H5650, [and] brought H5375 (8802) gifts H4503.
018:003 And David H1732 smote H5221 (8686) Hadarezer H1928 king H4428 of Zobah H6678 unto Hamath H2574, as he went H3212 (8800) to stablish H5324 (8687) his dominion H3027 by the river H5104 Euphrates H6578.
018:004 And David H1732 took H3920 (8799) from him a thousand H0505 chariots H7393, and seven H7651 thousand H0505 horsemen H6571, and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 footmen H0376 H7273: David H1732 also houghed H6131 (8762) all the chariot H7393 [horses], but reserved H3498 (8686) of them an hundred H3967 chariots H7393.
018:005 And when the Syrians H0758 of Damascus H1834 came H0935 (8799) to help H5826 (8800) Hadarezer H1928 king H4428 of Zobah H6678, David H1732 slew H5221 (8686) of the Syrians H0758 two H8147 and twenty H6242 thousand H0505 men H0376.
018:006 Then David H1732 put H7760 (8799) [garrisons] in Syriadamascus H0758 H1834; and the Syrians H0758 became David’s H1732 servants H5650, [and] brought H5375 (8802) gifts H4503. Thus the LORD H3068 preserved H3467 (8686) David H1732 whithersoever he went H1980 (8804).
018:007 And David H1732 took H3947 (8799) the shields H7982 of gold H2091 that were on the servants H5650 of Hadarezer H1928, and brought H0935 (8686) them to Jerusalem H3389.
018:008 Likewise from Tibhath H2880, and from Chun H3560, cities H5892 of Hadarezer H1928, brought H3947 (8804) David H1732 very H3966 much H7227 brass H5178, wherewith Solomon H8010 made H6213 (8804) the brasen H5178 sea H3220, and the pillars H5982, and the vessels H3627 of brass H5178.
018:009 Now when Tou H8583 king H4428 of Hamath H2574 heard H8085 (8799) how David H1732 had smitten H5221 (8689) all the host H2428 of Hadarezer H1928 king H4428 of Zobah H6678;
018:010 He sent H7971 (8799) Hadoram H1913 his son H1121 to king H4428 David H1732, to enquire H7592 (8800) of his welfare H7965, and to congratulate H1288 (8763) him, because he had fought H3898 (8738) against Hadarezer H1928, and smitten H5221 (8686) him; (for Hadarezer H1928 had war H0376 H4421 with Tou H8583;) and [with him] all manner of vessels H3627 of gold H2091 and silver H3701 and brass H5178.
018:011 Them also king H4428 David H1732 dedicated H6942 (8689) unto the LORD H3068, with the silver H3701 and the gold H2091 that he brought H5375 (8804) from all [these] nations H1471; from Edom H0123, and from Moab H4124, and from the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and from the Philistines H6430, and from Amalek H6002.
018:012 Moreover Abishai H0052 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 slew H5221 (8689) of the Edomites H0123 in the valley H1516 of salt H4417 eighteen H8083 H6240 thousand H0505.
018:013 And he put H7760 (8799) garrisons H5333 in Edom H0123; and all the Edomites H0123 became David’s H1732 servants H5650. Thus the LORD H3068 preserved H3467 (8686) David H1732 whithersoever he went H1980 (8804).
018:014 So David H1732 reigned H4427 (8799) over all Israel H3478, and executed H6213 (8802) judgment H4941 and justice H6666 among all his people H5971.
018:015 And Joab H3097 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 [was] over the host H6635; and Jehoshaphat H3092 the son H1121 of Ahilud H0286, recorder H2142 (8688).
018:016 And Zadok H6659 the son H1121 of Ahitub H0285, and Abimelech H0040 the son H1121 of Abiathar H0054, [were] the priests H3548; and Shavsha H7798 was scribe H5608 (8802);
018:017 And Benaiah H1141 the son H1121 of Jehoiada H3077 [was] over the Cherethites H3774 and the Pelethites H6432; and the sons H1121 of David H1732 [were] chief H7223 about H3027 the king H4428.
019:001 ¶  Now it came to pass after this H0310, that Nahash H5176 the king H4428 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 died H4191 (8799), and his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
019:002 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), I will shew H6213 (8799) kindness H2617 unto Hanun H2586 the son H1121 of Nahash H5176, because his father H0001 shewed H6213 (8804) kindness H2617 to me. And David H1732 sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397 to comfort H5162 (8763) him concerning his father H0001. So the servants H5650 of David H1732 came H0935 (8799) into the land H0776 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 to Hanun H2586, to comfort H5162 (8763) him.
019:003 But the princes H8269 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 said H0559 (8799) to Hanun H2586, Thinkest H5869 thou that David H1732 doth honour H3513 (8764) thy father H0001, that he hath sent H7971 (8804) comforters H5162 (8764) unto thee? are not his servants H5650 come H0935 (8804) unto thee for to search H2713 (8800), and to overthrow H2015 (8800), and to spy out H7270 (8763) the land H0776?
019:004 Wherefore Hanun H2586 took H3947 (8799) David’s H1732 servants H5650, and shaved H1548 (8762) them, and cut off H3772 (8799) their garments H4063 in the midst H2677 hard by their buttocks H4667, and sent them away H7971 (8762).
019:005 Then there went H3212 (8799) [certain], and told H5046 (8686) David H1732 how the men H0582 were served. And he sent H7971 (8799) to meet H7125 (8800) them: for the men H0582 were greatly H3966 ashamed H3637 (8737). And the king H4428 said H0559 (8799), Tarry H3427 (8798) at Jericho H3405 until your beards H2206 be grown H6779 (8762), and [then] return H7725 (8804).
019:006 And when the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 saw H7200 (8799) that they had made themselves odious H0887 (8694) to David H1732, Hanun H2586 and the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 sent H7971 (8799) a thousand H0505 talents H3603 of silver H3701 to hire H7936 (8800) them chariots H7393 and horsemen H6571 out of Mesopotamia H0763, and out of Syriamaachah H0758 H4601, and out of Zobah H6678.
019:007 So they hired H7936 (8799) thirty H7970 and two H8147 thousand H0505 chariots H7393, and the king H4428 of Maachah H4601 and his people H5971; who came H0935 (8799) and pitched H2583 (8799) before H6440 Medeba H4311. And the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 gathered themselves together H0622 (8738) from their cities H5892, and came H0935 (8799) to battle H4421.
019:008 And when David H1732 heard H8085 (8799) [of it], he sent H7971 (8799) Joab H3097, and all the host H6635 of the mighty men H1368.
019:009 And the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 came out H3318 (8799), and put the battle H4421 in array H6186 (8799) before the gate H6607 of the city H5892: and the kings H4428 that were come H0935 (8804) [were] by themselves in the field H7704.
019:010 Now when Joab H3097 saw H7200 (8799) that the battle H4421 was set against him before H6440 and behind H0268, he chose out H0977 (8799) of all the choice H0977 (8803) of Israel H3478, and put [them] in array H6186 (8799) against H7125 (8800) the Syrians H0758.
019:011 And the rest H3499 of the people H5971 he delivered H5414 (8804) unto the hand H3027 of Abishai H0052 his brother H0251, and they set [themselves] in array H6186 (8799) against H7125 (8800) the children H1121 of Ammon H5983.
019:012 And he said H0559 (8799), If the Syrians H0758 be too strong H2388 (8799) for me, then thou shalt help H8668 me: but if the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 be too strong H2388 (8799) for thee, then I will help H3467 (8689) thee.
019:013 Be of good courage H2388 (8798), and let us behave ourselves valiantly H2388 (8691) for our people H5971, and for the cities H5892 of our God H0430: and let the LORD H3068 do H6213 (8799) [that which is] good H2896 in his sight H5869.
019:014 So Joab H3097 and the people H5971 that [were] with him drew nigh H5066 (8799) before H6440 the Syrians H0758 unto the battle H4421; and they fled H5127 (8799) before H6440 him.
019:015 And when the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 saw H7200 (8804) that the Syrians H0758 were fled H5127 (8804), they likewise fled H5127 (8799) before H6440 Abishai H0052 his brother H0251, and entered H0935 (8799) into the city H5892. Then Joab H3097 came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
019:016 And when the Syrians H0758 saw H7200 (8799) that they were put to the worse H5062 (8738) before H6440 Israel H3478, they sent H7971 (8799) messengers H4397, and drew forth H3318 (8686) the Syrians H0758 that [were] beyond H5676 the river H5104: and Shophach H7780 the captain H8269 of the host H6635 of Hadarezer H1928 [went] before H6440 them.
019:017 And it was told H5046 (8714) David H1732; and he gathered H0622 (8799) all Israel H3478, and passed over H5674 (8799) Jordan H3383, and came H0935 (8799) upon them, and set [the battle] in array H6186 (8799) against them. So when David H1732 had put the battle H4421 in array H6186 (8799) against H7125 (8800) the Syrians H0758, they fought H3898 (8735) with him.
019:018 But the Syrians H0758 fled H5127 (8799) before H6440 Israel H3478; and David H1732 slew H2026 (8799) of the Syrians H0758 seven H7651 thousand H0505 [men which fought in] chariots H7393, and forty H0705 thousand H0505 footmen H0376 H7273, and killed H4191 (8689) Shophach H7780 the captain H8269 of the host H6635.
019:019 And when the servants H5650 of Hadarezer H1928 saw H7200 (8799) that they were put to the worse H5062 (8738) before H6440 Israel H3478, they made peace H7999 (8686) with David H1732, and became his servants H5647 (8799): neither would H0014 (8804) the Syrians H0758 help H3467 (8687) the children H1121 of Ammon H5983 any more.
020:001 ¶  And it came to pass, that after H6256 the year H8141 was expired H8666, at the time H6256 that kings H4428 go out H3318 (8800) [to battle], Joab H3097 led forth H5090 (8799) the power H2428 of the army H6635, and wasted H7843 (8686) the country H0776 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983, and came H0935 (8799) and besieged H6696 (8799) Rabbah H7237. But David H1732 tarried H3427 (8802) at Jerusalem H3389. And Joab H3097 smote H5221 (8686) Rabbah H7237, and destroyed H2040 (8799) it.
020:002 And David H1732 took H3947 (8799) the crown H5850 of their king H4428 from off his head H7218, and found H4672 (8799) it to weigh H4948 a talent H3603 of gold H2091, and [there were] precious H3368 stones H0068 in it; and it was set upon David’s H1732 head H7218: and he brought H3318 (8689) also exceeding H3966 much H7235 (8687) spoil H7998 out of the city H5892.
020:003 And he brought out H3318 (8689) the people H5971 that [were] in it, and cut H7787 (8799) [them] with saws H4050, and with harrows H2757 of iron H1270, and with axes H4050. Even so dealt H6213 (8799) David H1732 with all the cities H5892 of the children H1121 of Ammon H5983. And David H1732 and all the people H5971 returned H7725 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
020:004 And it came to pass after this H0310, that there arose H5975 (8799) war H4421 at Gezer H1507 with the Philistines H6430; at which time H0227 Sibbechai H5444 the Hushathite H2843 slew H5221 (8689) Sippai H5598, [that was] of the children H3211 of the giant H7497: and they were subdued H3665 (8735).
020:005 And there was war H4421 again with the Philistines H6430; and Elhanan H0445 the son H1121 of Jair H3265 slew H5221 (8686) Lahmi H3902 the brother H0251 of Goliath H1555 the Gittite H1663, whose spear H2595 staff H6086 [was] like a weaver’s H0707 (8802) beam H4500.
020:006 And yet again there was war H4421 at Gath H1661, where was a man H0376 of [great] stature H4060, whose fingers H0676 and toes H0676 [were] four H0702 and twenty H6242, six H8337 [on each hand], and six H8337 [on each foot]: and he also was the son H3205 (8738) of the giant H7497.
020:007 But when he defied H2778 (8762) Israel H3478, Jonathan H3083 the son H1121 of Shimea H8092 David’s H1732 brother H0251 slew H5221 (8686) him.
020:008 These H0411 were born H3205 (8738) unto the giant H7497 in Gath H1661; and they fell H5307 (8799) by the hand H3027 of David H1732, and by the hand H3027 of his servants H5650.
021:001 ¶  And Satan H7854 stood up H5975 (8799) against Israel H3478, and provoked H5496 (8686) David H1732 to number H4487 (8800) Israel H3478.
021:002 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Joab H3097 and to the rulers H8269 of the people H5971, Go H3212 (8798), number H5608 (8798) Israel H3478 from Beersheba H0884 even to Dan H1835; and bring H0935 (8685) the number H4557 of them to me, that I may know H3045 (8799) [it].
021:003 And Joab H3097 answered H0559 (8799), The LORD H3068 make his people H5971 an hundred H3967 times H6471 so many more H3254 (8686) as they H1992 [be]: but, my lord H0113 the king H4428, [are] they not all my lord’s H0113 servants H5650? why then doth my lord H0113 require H1245 (8762) this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass H0819 to Israel H3478?
021:004 Nevertheless the king’s H4428 word H1697 prevailed H2388 (8804) against Joab H3097. Wherefore Joab H3097 departed H3318 (8799), and went H1980 (8691) throughout all Israel H3478, and came H0935 (8799) to Jerusalem H3389.
021:005 And Joab H3097 gave H5414 (8799) the sum H4557 of the number H4662 of the people H5971 unto David H1732. And all [they of] Israel H3478 were a thousand H0505 thousand H0505 and an hundred H3967 thousand H0505 men H0376 that drew H8025 (8802) sword H2719: and Judah H3063 [was] four H0702 hundred H3967 threescore and ten H7657 thousand H0505 men H0376 that drew H8025 (8802) sword H2719.
021:006 But Levi H3878 and Benjamin H1144 counted H6485 (8804) he not among H8432 them: for the king’s H4428 word H1697 was abominable H8581 (8738) to Joab H3097.
021:007 And God H0430 was displeased H3415 (8799) H5869 with this thing H1697; therefore he smote H5221 (8686) Israel H3478.
021:008 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto God H0430, I have sinned H2398 (8804) greatly H3966, because I have done H6213 (8804) this thing H1697: but now, I beseech thee, do away H5674 (8685) the iniquity H5771 of thy servant H5650; for I have done very H3966 foolishly H5528 (8738).
021:009 And the LORD H3068 spake H1696 (8762) unto Gad H1410, David’s H1732 seer H2374, saying H0559 (8800),
021:010 Go H3212 (8798) and tell H1696 (8765) David H1732, saying H0559 (8800), Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, I offer H5186 (8802) thee three H7969 [things]: choose H0977 (8798) thee one H0259 of them H2007, that I may do H6213 (8799) [it] unto thee.
021:011 So Gad H1410 came H0935 (8799) to David H1732, and said H0559 (8799) unto him, Thus saith H0559 (8804) the LORD H3068, Choose H6901 (8761) thee
021:012 Either three H7969 years H8141 ’ famine H7458; or three H7969 months H2320 to be destroyed H5595 (8737) before H6440 thy foes H6862, while that the sword H2719 of thine enemies H0341 (8802) overtaketh H5381 (8688) [thee]; or H0518 else three H7969 days H3117 the sword H2719 of the LORD H3068, even the pestilence H1698, in the land H0776, and the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 destroying H7843 (8688) throughout all the coasts H1366 of Israel H3478. Now therefore advise H7200 (8798) thyself what word H1697 I shall bring again H7725 (8686) to him that sent H7971 (8802) me.
021:013 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto Gad H1410, I am in a great H3966 strait H6887 (8804): let me fall H5307 (8799) now into the hand H3027 of the LORD H3068; for very H3966 great H7227 [are] his mercies H7356: but let me not fall H5307 (8799) into the hand H3027 of man H0120.
021:014 So the LORD H3068 sent H5414 (8799) pestilence H1698 upon Israel H3478: and there fell H5307 (8799) of Israel H3478 seventy H7657 thousand H0505 men H0376.
021:015 And God H0430 sent H7971 (8799) an angel H4397 unto Jerusalem H3389 to destroy H7843 (8687) it: and as he was destroying H7843 (8687), the LORD H3068 beheld H7200 (8804), and he repented H5162 (8735) him of the evil H7451, and said H0559 (8799) to the angel H4397 that destroyed H7843 (8688), It is enough H7227, stay H7503 (8685) now thine hand H3027. And the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 stood H5975 (8802) by the threshingfloor H1637 of Ornan H0771 the Jebusite H2983.
021:016 And David H1732 lifted up H5375 (8799) his eyes H5869, and saw H7200 (8799) the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 stand H5975 (8802) between the earth H0776 and the heaven H8064, having a drawn H8025 (8803) sword H2719 in his hand H3027 stretched out H5186 (8803) over Jerusalem H3389. Then David H1732 and the elders H2205 [of Israel, who were] clothed H3680 (8794) in sackcloth H8242, fell H5307 (8799) upon their faces H6440.
021:017 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) unto God H0430, [Is it] not I [that] commanded H0559 (8804) the people H5971 to be numbered H4487 (8800)? even I it is that have sinned H2398 (8804) and done evil H7489 (8689) indeed H7489 (8687); but [as for] these sheep H6629, what have they done H6213 (8804)? let thine hand H3027, I pray thee, O LORD H3068 my God H0430, be on me, and on my father’s H0001 house H1004; but not on thy people H5971, that they should be plagued H4046.
021:018 Then the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068 commanded H0559 (8804) Gad H1410 to say H0559 (8800) to David H1732, that David H1732 should go up H5927 (8799), and set up H6965 (8687) an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068 in the threshingfloor H1637 of Ornan H0771 the Jebusite H2983.
021:019 And David H1732 went up H5927 (8799) at the saying H1697 of Gad H1410, which he spake H1696 (8765) in the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
021:020 And Ornan H0771 turned back H7725 (8799), and saw H7200 (8799) the angel H4397; and his four H0702 sons H1121 with him hid H2244 (8693) themselves. Now Ornan H0771 was threshing H1758 (8804) wheat H2406.
021:021 And as David H1732 came H0935 (8799) to Ornan H0771, Ornan H0771 looked H5027 (8686) and saw H7200 (8799) David H1732, and went out H3318 (8799) of the threshingfloor H1637, and bowed H7812 (8691) himself to David H1732 with [his] face H0639 to the ground H0776.
021:022 Then David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Ornan H0771, Grant H5414 (8798) me the place H4725 of [this] threshingfloor H1637, that I may build H1129 (8799) an altar H4196 therein unto the LORD H3068: thou shalt grant H5414 (8798) it me for the full H4392 price H3701: that the plague H4046 may be stayed H6113 (8735) from the people H5971.
021:023 And Ornan H0771 said H0559 (8799) unto David H1732, Take H3947 (8798) [it] to thee, and let my lord H0113 the king H4428 do H6213 (8799) [that which is] good H2896 in his eyes H5869: lo H7200 (8798), I give H5414 (8804) [thee] the oxen H1241 [also] for burnt offerings H5930, and the threshing instruments H4173 for wood H6086, and the wheat H2406 for the meat offering H4503; I give H5414 (8804) it all.
021:024 And king H4428 David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Ornan H0771, Nay; but I will verily H7069 (8800) buy H7069 (8799) it for the full H4392 price H3701: for I will not take H5375 (8799) [that] which [is] thine for the LORD H3068, nor offer H5927 (8687) burnt offerings H5930 without cost H2600.
021:025 So David H1732 gave H5414 (8799) to Ornan H0771 for the place H4725 six H8337 hundred H3967 shekels H8255 of gold H2091 by weight H4948.
021:026 And David H1732 built H1129 (8799) there an altar H4196 unto the LORD H3068, and offered H5927 (8686) burnt offerings H5930 and peace offerings H8002, and called H7121 (8799) upon the LORD H3068; and he answered H6030 (8799) him from heaven H8064 by fire H0784 upon the altar H4196 of burnt offering H5930.
021:027 And the LORD H3068 commanded H0559 (8799) the angel H4397; and he put up H7725 his sword H2719 again H7725 (8686) into the sheath H5084 thereof.
021:028 At that time H6256 when David H1732 saw H7200 (8800) that the LORD H3068 had answered H6030 (8804) him in the threshingfloor H1637 of Ornan H0771 the Jebusite H2983, then he sacrificed H2076 (8799) there.
021:029 For the tabernacle H4908 of the LORD H3068, which Moses H4872 made H6213 (8804) in the wilderness H4057, and the altar H4196 of the burnt offering H5930, [were] at that season H6256 in the high place H1116 at Gibeon H1391.
021:030 But David H1732 could H3201 (8804) not go H3212 (8800) before H6440 it to enquire H1875 (8800) of God H0430: for he was afraid H1204 (8738) because H6440 of the sword H2719 of the angel H4397 of the LORD H3068.
022:001 ¶  Then David H1732 said H0559 (8799), This [is] the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 God H0430, and this [is] the altar H4196 of the burnt offering H5930 for Israel H3478.
022:002 And David H1732 commanded H0559 (8799) to gather together H3664 (8800) the strangers H1616 that [were] in the land H0776 of Israel H3478; and he set H5975 (8686) masons H2672 (8802) to hew H2672 (8800) wrought H1496 stones H0068 to build H1129 (8800) the house H1004 of God H0430.
022:003 And David H1732 prepared H3559 (8689) iron H1270 in abundance H7230 for the nails H4548 for the doors H1817 of the gates H8179, and for the joinings H4226; and brass H5178 in abundance H7230 without weight H4948;
022:004 Also cedar H0730 trees H6086 in abundance H0369 H4557: for the Zidonians H6722 and they of Tyre H6876 brought H0935 (8689) much H7230 cedar H0730 wood H6086 to David H1732.
022:005 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799), Solomon H8010 my son H1121 [is] young H5288 and tender H7390, and the house H1004 [that is] to be builded H1129 (8800) for the LORD H3068 [must be] exceeding H4605 magnifical H1431 (8687), of fame H8034 and of glory H8597 throughout all countries H0776: I will [therefore] now make preparation H3559 (8686) for it. So David H1732 prepared H3559 (8686) abundantly H7230 before H6440 his death H4194.
022:006 Then he called H7121 (8799) for Solomon H8010 his son H1121, and charged H6680 (8762) him to build H1129 (8800) an house H1004 for the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478.
022:007 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Solomon H8010, My son H1121, as for me, it was in my mind H3824 to build H1129 (8800) an house H1004 unto the name H8034 of the LORD H3068 my God H0430:
022:008 But the word H1697 of the LORD H3068 came to me, saying H0559 (8800), Thou hast shed H8210 (8804) blood H1818 abundantly H7230, and hast made H6213 (8804) great H1419 wars H4421: thou shalt not build H1129 (8799) an house H1004 unto my name H8034, because thou hast shed H8210 (8804) much H7227 blood H1818 upon the earth H0776 in my sight H6440.
022:009 Behold, a son H1121 shall be born H3205 (8737) to thee, who shall be a man H0376 of rest H4496; and I will give him rest H5117 (8689) from all his enemies H0341 (8802) round about H5439: for his name H8034 shall be Solomon H8010, and I will give H5414 (8799) peace H7965 and quietness H8253 unto Israel H3478 in his days H3117.
022:010 He shall build H1129 (8799) an house H1004 for my name H8034; and he shall be my son H1121, and I [will be] his father H0001; and I will establish H3559 (8689) the throne H3678 of his kingdom H4438 over Israel H3478 for H5704 ever H5769.
022:011 Now, my son H1121, the LORD H3068 be with thee; and prosper H6743 (8689) thou, and build H1129 (8804) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430, as he hath said H1696 (8765) of thee.
022:012 Only the LORD H3068 give H5414 (8799) thee wisdom H7922 and understanding H0998, and give thee charge H6680 (8762) concerning Israel H3478, that thou mayest keep H8104 (8800) the law H8451 of the LORD H3068 thy God H0430.
022:013 Then shalt thou prosper H6743 (8686), if thou takest heed H8104 (8799) to fulfil H6213 (8800) the statutes H2706 and judgments H4941 which the LORD H3068 charged H6680 (8765) Moses H4872 with concerning Israel H3478: be strong H2388 (8798), and of good courage H0553 (8798); dread H3372 (8799) not, nor be dismayed H2865 (8735).
022:014 Now, behold, in my trouble H6040 I have prepared H3559 (8689) for the house H1004 of the LORD H3068 an hundred H3967 thousand H0505 talents H3603 of gold H2091, and a thousand H0505 thousand H0505 talents H3603 of silver H3701; and of brass H5178 and iron H1270 without weight H4948; for it is in abundance H7230: timber H6086 also and stone H0068 have I prepared H3559 (8689); and thou mayest add H3254 (8686) thereto.
022:015 Moreover [there are] workmen H6213 (8802) H4399 with thee in abundance H7230, hewers H2672 (8802) and workers H2796 of stone H0068 and timber H6086, and all manner of cunning men H2450 for every manner of work H4399.
022:016 Of the gold H2091, the silver H3701, and the brass H5178, and the iron H1270, [there is] no number H4557. Arise H6965 (8798) [therefore], and be doing H6213 (8798), and the LORD H3068 be with thee.
022:017 David H1732 also commanded H6680 (8762) all the princes H8269 of Israel H3478 to help H5826 (8800) Solomon H8010 his son H1121, [saying],
022:018 [Is] not the LORD H3068 your God H0430 with you? and hath he [not] given you rest H5117 (8689) on every side H5439? for he hath given H5414 (8804) the inhabitants H3427 (8802) of the land H0776 into mine hand H3027; and the land H0776 is subdued H3533 (8738) before H6440 the LORD H3068, and before H6440 his people H5971.
022:019 Now set H5414 (8798) your heart H3824 and your soul H5315 to seek H1875 (8800) the LORD H3068 your God H0430; arise H6965 (8798) therefore, and build H1129 (8798) ye the sanctuary H4720 of the LORD H3068 God H0430, to bring H0935 (8687) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, and the holy H6944 vessels H3627 of God H0430, into the house H1004 that is to be built H1129 (8737) to the name H8034 of the LORD H3068.
023:001 ¶  So when David H1732 was old H2204 (8804) and full H7646 (8804) of days H3117, he made Solomon H8010 his son H1121 king H4427 (8686) over Israel H3478.
023:002 And he gathered together H0622 (8799) all the princes H8269 of Israel H3478, with the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881.
023:003 Now the Levites H3881 were numbered H5608 (8735) from the age H1121 of thirty H7970 years H8141 and upward H4605: and their number H4557 by their polls H1538, man by man H1397, was thirty H7970 and eight H8083 thousand H0505.
023:004 Of which H0428, twenty H6242 and four H0702 thousand H0505 [were] to set forward H5329 (8763) the work H4399 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068; and six H8337 thousand H0505 [were] officers H7860 (8802) and judges H8199 (8802):
023:005 Moreover four H0702 thousand H0505 [were] porters H7778; and four H0702 thousand H0505 praised H1984 (8764) the LORD H3068 with the instruments H3627 which I made H6213 (8804), [said David], to praise H1984 (8763) [therewith].
023:006 And David H1732 divided H2505 (8735) them into courses H4256 among the sons H1121 of Levi H3878, [namely], Gershon H1648, Kohath H6955, and Merari H4847.
023:007 Of the Gershonites H1649 [were], Laadan H3936, and Shimei H8096.
023:008 The sons H1121 of Laadan H3936; the chief H7218 [was] Jehiel H3171, and Zetham H2241, and Joel H3100, three H7969.
023:009 The sons H1121 of Shimei H8096; Shelomith H8019 (8675) H8013, and Haziel H2381, and Haran H2039, three H7969. These [were] the chief H7218 of the fathers H0001 of Laadan H3936.
023:010 And the sons H1121 of Shimei H8096 [were], Jahath H3189, Zina H2126, and Jeush H3266, and Beriah H1283. These four H0702 [were] the sons H1121 of Shimei H8096.
023:011 And Jahath H3189 was the chief H7218, and Zizah H2125 the second H8145: but Jeush H3266 and Beriah H1283 had not many H7235 (8689) sons H1121; therefore they were in one H0259 reckoning H6486, according to [their] father’s H0001 house H1004.
023:012 The sons H1121 of Kohath H6955; Amram H6019, Izhar H3324, Hebron H2275, and Uzziel H5816, four H0702.
023:013 The sons H1121 of Amram H6019; Aaron H0175 and Moses H4872: and Aaron H0175 was separated H0914 (8735), that he should sanctify H6942 (8687) the most H6944 holy things H6944, he and his sons H1121 for H5704 ever H5769, to burn incense H6999 (8687) before H6440 the LORD H3068, to minister H8334 (8763) unto him, and to bless H1288 (8763) in his name H8034 for H5704 ever H5769.
023:014 Now [concerning] Moses H4872 the man H0376 of God H0430, his sons H1121 were named H7121 (8735) of the tribe H7626 of Levi H3878.
023:015 The sons H1121 of Moses H4872 [were], Gershom H1647, and Eliezer H0461.
023:016 Of the sons H1121 of Gershom H1647, Shebuel H7619 [was] the chief H7218.
023:017 And the sons H1121 of Eliezer H0461 [were], Rehabiah H7345 the chief H7218. And Eliezer H0461 had none other H0312 sons H1121; but the sons H1121 of Rehabiah H7345 were very H4605 many H7235 (8804).
023:018 Of the sons H1121 of Izhar H3324; Shelomith H8019 the chief H7218.
023:019 Of the sons H1121 of Hebron H2275; Jeriah H3404 the first H7218, Amariah H0568 the second H8145, Jahaziel H3166 the third H7992, and Jekameam H3360 the fourth H7243.
023:020 Of the sons H1121 of Uzziel H5816; Michah H4318 the first H7218, and Jesiah H3449 the second H8145.
023:021 The sons H1121 of Merari H4847; Mahli H4249, and Mushi H4187. The sons H1121 of Mahli H4249; Eleazar H0499, and Kish H7027.
023:022 And Eleazar H0499 died H4191 (8799), and had no sons H1121, but daughters H1323: and their brethren H0251 the sons H1121 of Kish H7027 took H5375 (8799) them.
023:023 The sons H1121 of Mushi H4187; Mahli H4249, and Eder H5740, and Jeremoth H3406, three H7969.
023:024 These [were] the sons H1121 of Levi H3878 after the house H1004 of their fathers H0001; [even] the chief H7218 of the fathers H0001, as they were counted H6485 (8803) by number H4557 of names H8034 by their polls H1538, that did H6213 (8802) the work H4399 for the service H5656 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, from the age H1121 of twenty H6242 years H8141 and upward H4605.
023:025 For David H1732 said H0559 (8804), The LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 hath given rest H5117 (8689) unto his people H5971, that they may dwell H7931 (8799) in Jerusalem H3389 for ever H5769:
023:026 And also unto the Levites H3881; they shall no [more] carry H5375 (8800) the tabernacle H4908, nor any vessels H3627 of it for the service H5656 thereof.
023:027 For by the last H0314 words H1697 of David H1732 the Levites H3881 [were] numbered H4557 from twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 and above H4605:
023:028 Because their office H4612 [was] to wait H3027 on the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 for the service H5656 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, in the courts H2691, and in the chambers H3957, and in the purifying H2893 of all holy things H6944, and the work H4639 of the service H5656 of the house H1004 of God H0430;
023:029 Both for the shewbread H3899 H4635, and for the fine flour H5560 for meat offering H4503, and for the unleavened H4682 cakes H7550, and for [that which is baked in] the pan H4227, and for that which is fried H7246 (8716), and for all manner of measure H4884 and size H4060;
023:030 And to stand H5975 (8800) every morning H1242 to thank H3034 (8687) and praise H1984 (8763) the LORD H3068, and likewise at even H6153;
023:031 And to offer H5927 (8687) all burnt sacrifices H5930 unto the LORD H3068 in the sabbaths H7676, in the new moons H2320, and on the set feasts H4150, by number H4557, according to the order H4941 commanded unto them, continually H8548 before H6440 the LORD H3068:
023:032 And that they should keep H8104 (8804) the charge H4931 of the tabernacle H0168 of the congregation H4150, and the charge H4931 of the holy H6944 [place], and the charge H4931 of the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175 their brethren H0251, in the service H5656 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
024:001 ¶  Now [these are] the divisions H4256 of the sons H1121 of Aaron H0175. The sons H1121 of Aaron H0175; Nadab H5070, and Abihu H0030, Eleazar H0499, and Ithamar H0385.
024:002 But Nadab H5070 and Abihu H0030 died H4191 (8799) before H6440 their father H0001, and had no children H1121: therefore Eleazar H0499 and Ithamar H0385 executed the priest’s office H3547 (8762).
024:003 And David H1732 distributed H2505 (8735) them, both Zadok H6659 of the sons H1121 of Eleazar H0499, and Ahimelech H0288 of the sons H1121 of Ithamar H0385, according to their offices H6486 in their service H5656.
024:004 And there were more H7227 chief H7218 men H1397 found H4672 (8735) of the sons H1121 of Eleazar H0499 than of the sons H1121 of Ithamar H0385; and [thus] were they divided H2505 (8799). Among the sons H1121 of Eleazar H0499 [there were] sixteen H8337 H6240 chief men H7218 of the house H1004 of [their] fathers H0001, and eight H8083 among the sons H1121 of Ithamar H0385 according to the house H1004 of their fathers H0001.
024:005 Thus were they divided H2505 (8799) by lot H1486, one sort H0428 with another H0428; for the governors H8269 of the sanctuary H6944, and governors H8269 [of the house] of God H0430, were of the sons H1121 of Eleazar H0499, and of the sons H1121 of Ithamar H0385.
024:006 And Shemaiah H8098 the son H1121 of Nethaneel H5417 the scribe H5608 (8802), [one] of the Levites H3881, wrote H3789 (8799) them before H6440 the king H4428, and the princes H8269, and Zadok H6659 the priest H3548, and Ahimelech H0288 the son H1121 of Abiathar H0054, and [before] the chief H7218 of the fathers H0001 of the priests H3548 and Levites H3881: one H0259 principal H0001 household H1004 being taken H0270 (8803) for Eleazar H0499, and [one] taken H0270 (8803) for Ithamar H0385.

026:026 Which Shelomith H8013 and his brethren H0251 [were] over all the treasures H0214 of the dedicated things H6944, which David H1732 the king H4428, and the chief H7218 fathers H0001, the captains H8269 over thousands H0505 and hundreds H3967, and the captains H8269 of the host H6635, had dedicated H6942 (8689).
026:027 Out of the spoils H7998 won in battles H4421 did they dedicate H6942 (8689) to maintain H2388 (8763) the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.

027:023 But David H1732 took H5375 (8804) not the number H4557 of them from twenty H6242 years H8141 old H1121 and under H4295: because the LORD H3068 had said H0559 (8804) he would increase H7235 (8687) Israel H3478 like to the stars H3556 of the heavens H8064.
027:024 Joab H3097 the son H1121 of Zeruiah H6870 began H2490 (8689) to number H4487 (8800), but he finished H3615 (8765) not, because there fell wrath H7110 for it H2063 against Israel H3478; neither was the number H4557 put H5927 (8804) in the account H4557 of the chronicles H1697 H3117 of king H4428 David H1732.

027:033 And Ahithophel H0302 [was] the king’s H4428 counsellor H3289 (8802): and Hushai H2365 the Archite H0757 [was] the king’s H4428 companion H7453:
027:034 And after H0310 Ahithophel H0302 [was] Jehoiada H3077 the son H1121 of Benaiah H1141, and Abiathar H0054: and the general H8269 of the king’s H4428 army H6635 [was] Joab H3097.
028:001 ¶  And David H1732 assembled H6950 (8686) all the princes H8269 of Israel H3478, the princes H8269 of the tribes H7626, and the captains H8269 of the companies H4256 that ministered H8334 (8764) to the king H4428 by course H4256, and the captains H8269 over the thousands H0505, and captains H8269 over the hundreds H3967, and the stewards H8269 over all the substance H7399 and possession H4735 of the king H4428, and of his sons H1121, with the officers H5631, and with the mighty men H1368, and with all the valiant men H2428, unto Jerusalem H3389.
028:002 Then David H1732 the king H4428 stood up H6965 (8799) upon his feet H7272, and said H0559 (8799), Hear H8085 (8798) me, my brethren H0251, and my people H5971: [As for me], I [had] in mine heart H3824 to build H1129 (8800) an house H1004 of rest H4496 for the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068, and for the footstool H1916 H7272 of our God H0430, and had made ready H3559 (8689) for the building H1129 (8800):
028:003 But God H0430 said H0559 (8804) unto me, Thou shalt not build H1129 (8799) an house H1004 for my name H8034, because thou [hast been] a man H0376 of war H4421, and hast shed H8210 (8804) blood H1818.
028:004 Howbeit the LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 chose H0977 (8799) me before all the house H1004 of my father H0001 to be king H4428 over Israel H3478 for ever H5769: for he hath chosen H0977 (8804) Judah H3063 [to be] the ruler H5057; and of the house H1004 of Judah H3063, the house H1004 of my father H0001; and among the sons H1121 of my father H0001 he liked H7521 (8804) me to make [me] king H4427 (8687) over all Israel H3478:
028:005 And of all my sons H1121, (for the LORD H3068 hath given H5414 (8804) me many H7227 sons H1121,) he hath chosen H0977 (8799) Solomon H8010 my son H1121 to sit H3427 (8800) upon the throne H3678 of the kingdom H4438 of the LORD H3068 over Israel H3478.
028:006 And he said H0559 (8799) unto me, Solomon H8010 thy son H1121, he shall build H1129 (8799) my house H1004 and my courts H2691: for I have chosen H0977 (8804) him [to be] my son H1121, and I will be his father H0001.
028:007 Moreover I will establish H3559 (8689) his kingdom H4438 for ever H5769, if he be constant H2388 (8799) to do H6213 (8800) my commandments H4687 and my judgments H4941, as at this day H3117.
028:008 Now therefore in the sight H5869 of all Israel H3478 the congregation H6951 of the LORD H3068, and in the audience H0241 of our God H0430, keep H8104 (8798) and seek H1875 (8798) for all the commandments H4687 of the LORD H3068 your God H0430: that ye may possess H3423 (8799) this good H2896 land H0776, and leave [it] for an inheritance H5157 (8689) for your children H1121 after H0310 you for H5704 ever H5769.
028:009 And thou, Solomon H8010 my son H1121, know H3045 (8798) thou the God H0430 of thy father H0001, and serve H5647 (8798) him with a perfect H8003 heart H3820 and with a willing H2655 mind H5315: for the LORD H3068 searcheth H1875 (8802) all hearts H3824, and understandeth H0995 (8688) all the imaginations H3336 of the thoughts H4284: if thou seek H1875 (8799) him, he will be found H4672 (8735) of thee; but if thou forsake H5800 (8799) him, he will cast thee off H2186 (8686) for ever H5703.
028:010 Take heed H7200 (8798) now; for the LORD H3068 hath chosen H0977 (8804) thee to build H1129 (8800) an house H1004 for the sanctuary H4720: be strong H2388 (8798), and do H6213 (8798) [it].
028:011 Then David H1732 gave H5414 (8799) to Solomon H8010 his son H1121 the pattern H8403 of the porch H0197, and of the houses H1004 thereof, and of the treasuries H1597 thereof, and of the upper chambers H5944 thereof, and of the inner H6442 parlours H2315 thereof, and of the place H1004 of the mercy seat H3727,
028:012 And the pattern H8403 of all that he had by the spirit H7307, of the courts H2691 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and of all the chambers H3957 round about H5439, of the treasuries H0214 of the house H1004 of God H0430, and of the treasuries H0214 of the dedicated things H6944:
028:013 Also for the courses H4256 of the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881, and for all the work H4399 of the service H5656 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, and for all the vessels H3627 of service H5656 in the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
028:014 [He gave] of gold H2091 by weight H4948 for [things] of gold H2091, for all instruments H3627 of all manner of service H5656; [silver also] for all instruments H3627 of silver H3701 by weight H4948, for all instruments H3627 of every kind of service H5656:
028:015 Even the weight H4948 for the candlesticks H4501 of gold H2091, and for their lamps H5216 of gold H2091, by weight H4948 for every candlestick H4501, and for the lamps H5216 thereof: and for the candlesticks H4501 of silver H3701 by weight H4948, [both] for the candlestick H4501, and [also] for the lamps H5216 thereof, according to the use H5656 of every candlestick H4501.
028:016 And by weight H4948 [he gave] gold H2091 for the tables H7979 of shewbread H4635, for every table H7979; and [likewise] silver H3701 for the tables H7979 of silver H3701:
028:017 Also pure H2889 gold H2091 for the fleshhooks H4207, and the bowls H4219, and the cups H7184: and for the golden H2091 basons H3713 [he gave gold] by weight H4948 for every bason H3713; and [likewise silver] by weight H4948 for every bason H3713 of silver H3701:
028:018 And for the altar H4196 of incense H7004 refined H2212 (8794) gold H2091 by weight H4948; and gold H2091 for the pattern H8403 of the chariot H4818 of the cherubims H3742, that spread out H6566 (8802) [their wings], and covered H5526 (8802) the ark H0727 of the covenant H1285 of the LORD H3068.
028:019 All [this, said David], the LORD H3068 made me understand H7919 (8689) in writing H3791 by [his] hand H3027 upon me, [even] all the works H4399 of this pattern H8403.
028:020 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to Solomon H8010 his son H1121, Be strong H2388 (8798) and of good courage H0553 (8798), and do H6213 (8798) [it]: fear H3372 (8799) not, nor be dismayed H2865 (8735): for the LORD H3068 God H0430, [even] my God H0430, [will be] with thee; he will not fail H7503 (8686) thee, nor forsake H5800 (8799) thee, until thou hast finished H3615 (8800) all the work H4399 for the service H5656 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068.
028:021 And, behold, the courses H4256 of the priests H3548 and the Levites H3881, [even they shall be with thee] for all the service H5656 of the house H1004 of God H0430: and [there shall be] with thee for all manner of workmanship H4399 every willing H5081 skilful man H2451, for any manner of service H5656: also the princes H8269 and all the people H5971 [will be] wholly at thy commandment H1697.
029:001 ¶  Furthermore David H1732 the king H4428 said H0559 (8799) unto all the congregation H6951, Solomon H8010 my son H1121, whom alone H0259 God H0430 hath chosen H0977 (8804), [is yet] young H5288 and tender H7390, and the work H4399 [is] great H1419: for the palace H1002 [is] not for man H0120, but for the LORD H3068 God H0430.
029:002 Now I have prepared H3559 (8689) with all my might H3581 for the house H1004 of my God H0430 the gold H2091 for [things to be made] of gold H2091, and the silver H3701 for [things] of silver H3701, and the brass H5178 for [things] of brass H5178, the iron H1270 for [things] of iron H1270, and wood H6086 for [things] of wood H6086; onyx H7718 stones H0068, and [stones] to be set H4394, glistering H6320 stones H0068, and of divers colours H7553, and all manner of precious H3368 stones H0068, and marble H7893 stones H0068 in abundance H7230.
029:003 Moreover, because I have set my affection H7521 (8800) to the house H1004 of my God H0430, I have H3426 of mine own proper good H5459, of gold H2091 and silver H3701, [which] I have given H5414 (8804) to the house H1004 of my God H0430, over and above H4605 all that I have prepared H3559 (8689) for the holy H6944 house H1004,
029:004 [Even] three H7969 thousand H0505 talents H3603 of gold H2091, of the gold H2091 of Ophir H0211, and seven H7651 thousand H0505 talents H3603 of refined H2212 (8794) silver H3701, to overlay H2902 (8800) the walls H7023 of the houses H1004 [withal]:
029:005 The gold H2091 for [things] of gold H2091, and the silver H3701 for [things] of silver H3701, and for all manner of work H4399 [to be made] by the hands H3027 of artificers H2796. And who [then] is willing H5068 (8693) to consecrate H4390 (8763) his service H3027 this day H3117 unto the LORD H3068?
029:006 Then the chief H8269 of the fathers H0001 and princes H8269 of the tribes H7626 of Israel H3478, and the captains H8269 of thousands H0505 and of hundreds H3967, with the rulers H8269 of the king’s H4428 work H4399, offered willingly H5068 (8691),
029:007 And gave H5414 (8799) for the service H5656 of the house H1004 of God H0430 of gold H2091 five H2568 thousand H0505 talents H3603 and ten thousand H7239 drams H0150, and of silver H3701 ten H6235 thousand H0505 talents H3603, and of brass H5178 eighteen H8083 H7239 thousand H0505 talents H3603, and one hundred H3967 thousand H0505 talents H3603 of iron H1270.
029:008 And they with whom [precious] stones H0068 were found H4672 (8737) gave H5414 (8804) [them] to the treasure H0214 of the house H1004 of the LORD H3068, by the hand H3027 of Jehiel H3171 the Gershonite H1649.
029:009 Then the people H5971 rejoiced H8055 (8799), for that they offered willingly H5068 (8692), because with perfect H8003 heart H3820 they offered willingly H5068 (8694) to the LORD H3068: and David H1732 the king H4428 also rejoiced H8055 (8804) with great H1419 joy H8057.
029:010 Wherefore David H1732 blessed H1288 (8762) the LORD H3068 before H5869 all the congregation H6951: and David H1732 said H0559 (8799), Blessed H1288 (8803) [be] thou, LORD H3068 God H0430 of Israel H3478 our father H0001, for H5704 ever H5769 and ever H5769.
029:011 Thine, O LORD H3068, [is] the greatness H1420, and the power H1369, and the glory H8597, and the victory H5331, and the majesty H1935: for all [that is] in the heaven H8064 and in the earth H0776 [is thine]; thine [is] the kingdom H4467, O LORD H3068, and thou art exalted H4984 (8693) as head H7218 above all.
029:012 Both riches H6239 and honour H3519 [come] of thee H6440, and thou reignest H4910 (8802) over all; and in thine hand H3027 [is] power H3581 and might H1369; and in thine hand H3027 [it is] to make great H1431 (8763), and to give strength H2388 (8763) unto all.
029:013 Now therefore, our God H0430, we thank H3034 (8688) thee, and praise H1984 (8764) thy glorious H8597 name H8034.
029:014 But who [am] I, and what [is] my people H5971, that we should be H6113 (8799) able H3581 to offer so willingly H5068 (8692) after this sort? for all things [come] of thee, and of thine own H3027 have we given H5414 (8804) thee.
029:015 For we [are] strangers H1616 before H6440 thee, and sojourners H8453, as [were] all our fathers H0001: our days H3117 on the earth H0776 [are] as a shadow H6738, and [there is] none abiding H4723.
029:016 O LORD H3068 our God H0430, all this store H1995 that we have prepared H3559 (8689) to build H1129 (8800) thee an house H1004 for thine holy H6944 name H8034 [cometh] of thine hand H3027, and [is] all thine own.
029:017 I know H3045 (8804) also, my God H0430, that thou triest H0974 (8802) the heart H3824, and hast pleasure H7521 (8799) in uprightness H3476. As for me, in the uprightness H4339 of mine heart H3824 I have willingly offered H5068 (8694) all these things: and now have I seen H7200 (8804) with joy H8057 thy people H5971, which are present H4672 (8738) here, to offer willingly H5068 (8692) unto thee.
029:018 O LORD H3068 God H0430 of Abraham H0085, Isaac H3327, and of Israel H3478, our fathers H0001, keep H8104 (8798) this for ever H5769 in the imagination H3336 of the thoughts H4284 of the heart H3824 of thy people H5971, and prepare H3559 (8685) their heart H3824 unto thee:
029:019 And give H5414 (8798) unto Solomon H8010 my son H1121 a perfect H8003 heart H3824, to keep H8104 (8800) thy commandments H4687, thy testimonies H5715, and thy statutes H2706, and to do H6213 (8800) all [these things], and to build H1129 (8800) the palace H1002, [for] the which I have made provision H3559 (8689).
029:020 And David H1732 said H0559 (8799) to all the congregation H6951, Now bless H1288 (8761) the LORD H3068 your God H0430. And all the congregation H6951 blessed H1288 (8762) the LORD H3068 God H0430 of their fathers H0001, and bowed down their heads H6915 (8799), and worshipped H7812 (8691) the LORD H3068, and the king H4428.
029:021 And they sacrificed H2076 (8799) sacrifices H2077 unto the LORD H3068, and offered H5927 (8686) burnt offerings H5930 unto the LORD H3068, on the morrow H4283 after that day H3117, [even] a thousand H0505 bullocks H6499, a thousand H0505 rams H0352, [and] a thousand H0505 lambs H3532, with their drink offerings H5262, and sacrifices H2077 in abundance H7230 for all Israel H3478:
029:022 And did eat H0398 (8799) and drink H8354 (8799) before H6440 the LORD H3068 on that day H3117 with great H1419 gladness H8057. And they made Solomon H8010 the son H1121 of David H1732 king H4427 (8686) the second time H8145, and anointed H4886 (8799) [him] unto the LORD H3068 [to be] the chief governor H5057, and Zadok H6659 [to be] priest H3548.
029:023 Then Solomon H8010 sat on H3427 (8799) the throne H3678 of the LORD H3068 as king H4428 instead of David H1732 his father H0001, and prospered H6743 (8686); and all Israel H3478 obeyed H8085 (8799) him.
029:024 And all the princes H8269, and the mighty men H1368, and all the sons H1121 likewise of king H4428 David H1732, submitted themselves H5414 (8804) H3027 H8478 unto Solomon H8010 the king H4428.
029:025 And the LORD H3068 magnified H1431 (8762) Solomon H8010 exceedingly H4605 in the sight H5869 of all Israel H3478, and bestowed H5414 (8799) upon him [such] royal H4438 majesty H1935 as had not been on any king H4428 before H6440 him in Israel H3478.
029:026 Thus David H1732 the son H1121 of Jesse H3448 reigned H4427 (8804) over all Israel H3478.
029:027 And the time H3117 that he reigned H4427 (8804) over Israel H3478 [was] forty H0705 years H8141; seven H7651 years H8141 reigned H4427 (8804) he in Hebron H2275, and thirty H7970 and three H7969 [years] reigned H4427 (8804) he in Jerusalem H3389.
029:028 And he died H4191 (8799) in a good H2896 old age H7872, full H7649 of days H3117, riches H6239, and honour H3519: and Solomon H8010 his son H1121 reigned H4427 (8799) in his stead.
029:029 Now the acts H1697 of David H1732 the king H4428, first H7223 and last H0314, behold, they [are] written H3789 (8803) in the book H1697 of Samuel H8050 the seer H7200 (8802), and in the book H1697 of Nathan H5416 the prophet H5030, and in the book H1697 of Gad H1410 the seer H2374,
029:030 With all his reign H4438 and his might H1369, and the times H6256 that went over H5674 (8804) him, and over Israel H3478, and over all the kingdoms H4467 of the countries H0776.
