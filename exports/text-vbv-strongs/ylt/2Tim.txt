001:001 ¶  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, according to a promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,
001:002 to Timotheus, beloved child: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord!
001:003 I am thankful to God, whom I serve from progenitors in a pure conscience, that unceasingly I have remembrance concerning thee in my supplications night and day,
001:004 desiring greatly to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that with joy I may be filled,
001:005 taking remembrance of the unfeigned faith that is in thee, that dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that also in thee.
001:006 For which cause I remind thee to stir up the gift of God that is in thee through the putting on of my hands,
001:007 for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind;
001:008 therefore thou mayest not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but do thou suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God,
001:009 who did save us, and did call with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages,
001:010 and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who indeed did abolish death, and did enlighten life and immortality through the good news,
001:011 to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a teacher of nations,
001:012 for which cause also these things I suffer, but I am not ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that he is able that which I have committed to him to guard-to that day.
001:013 The pattern hold thou of sound words, which from me thou didst hear, in faith and love that is in Christ Jesus;
001:014 the good thing committed guard thou through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us;
001:015 thou hast known this, that they did turn from me-all those in Asia, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes;
001:016 may the Lord give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus, because many times he did refresh me, and of my chain was not ashamed,
001:017 but being in Rome, very diligently he sought me, and found;
001:018 may the Lord give to him to find kindness from the Lord in that day; and how many things in Ephesus he did minister thou dost very well know.
002:001 ¶  Thou, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus,
002:002 and the things that thou didst hear from me through many witnesses, these things be committing to stedfast men, who shall be sufficient also others to teach;
002:003 thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ;
002:004 no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please;
002:005 and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully;
002:006 the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to partake;
002:007 be considering what things I say, for the Lord give to thee understanding in all things.
002:008 Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news,
002:009 in which I suffer evil-unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God hath not been bound;
002:010 because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that is in Christ Jesus, with glory age-during.
002:011 Stedfast is the word: For if we died together-we also shall live together;
002:012 if we do endure together-we shall also reign together; if we deny him, he also shall deny us;
002:013 if we are not stedfast, he remaineth stedfast; to deny himself he is not able.
002:014 These things remind them of, testifying fully before the Lord-not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing;
002:015 be diligent to present thyself approved to God-a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;
002:016 and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance,
002:017 and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,
002:018 who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some;
002:019 sure, nevertheless, hath the foundation of God stood, having this seal, ‘The Lord hath known those who are His,’ and ‘Let him depart from unrighteousness-every one who is naming the name of Christ.’
002:020 And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour:
002:021 if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master-to every good work having been prepared,
002:022 and the youthful lusts flee thou, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart;
002:023 and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife,
002:024 and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,
002:025 in meekness instructing those opposing-if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,
002:026 and they may awake out of the devil’s snare, having been caught by him at his will.
003:001 ¶  And this know thou, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,
003:002 for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, evil-speakers, to parents disobedient, unthankful, unkind,
003:003 without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,
003:004 traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,
003:005 having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and from these be turning away,
003:006 for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden with sins, led away with desires manifold,
003:007 always learning, and never to a knowledge of truth able to come,
003:008 and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also these do stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith;
003:009 but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also did become.
003:010 And thou-thou hast followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,
003:011 the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,
003:012 and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,
003:013 and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.
003:014 And thou-be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with, having known from whom thou didst learn,
003:015 and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known, which are able to make thee wise-to salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus;
003:016 every Writing is God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright, for instruction that is in righteousness,
003:017 that the man of God may be fitted-for every good work having been completed.
004:001 ¶  I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his manifestation and his reign-
004:002 preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season, convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,
004:003 for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer, but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers-itching in the hearing,
004:004 and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away, and to the fables they shall be turned aside.
004:005 And thou-watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full assurance,
004:006 for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release hath arrived;
004:007 the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished, the faith I have kept,
004:008 henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord-the Righteous Judge-shall give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those loving his manifestation.
004:009 Be diligent to come unto me quickly,
004:010 for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia,
004:011 Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with thyself, for he is profitable to me for ministration;
004:012 and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus;
004:013 the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring thou and the books-especially the parchments.
004:014 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the Lord repay to him according to his works,
004:015 of whom also do thou beware, for greatly hath he stood against our words;
004:016 in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me, (may it not be reckoned to them!)
004:017 and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,
004:018 and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall save me-to his heavenly kingdom; to whom is the glory to the ages of the ages! Amen.
004:019 Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus’ household;
004:020 Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus infirm;
004:021 be diligent to come before winter. Salute thee doth Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
004:022 The Lord Jesus Christ is with thy spirit; the grace is with you! Amen.
