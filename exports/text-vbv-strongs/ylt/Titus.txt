001:001 ¶  Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that is according to piety,
001:002 upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,
001:003 (and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,
001:004 to Titus-true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!
001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;
001:006 if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate-
001:007 for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;
001:008 but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,
001:009 holding-according to the teaching-to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;
001:010 for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers-especially they of the circumcision-
001:011 whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
001:012 A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said-‘Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!’
001:013 this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
001:014 not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;
001:015 all things, indeed, are pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast is nothing pure, but of them defiled are even the mind and the conscience;
001:016 God they profess to know, and in the works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.
002:001 ¶  And thou-be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;
002:002 aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;
002:003 aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,
002:004 that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,
002:005 sober, pure, keepers of their own houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.
002:006 The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;
002:007 concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,
002:008 discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.
002:009 Servants-to their own masters are to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,
002:010 not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.
002:011 For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,
002:012 teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,
002:013 waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
002:014 who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;
002:015 these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!
003:001 ¶  Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,
003:002 of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome-gentle, showing all meekness to all men,
003:003 for we were once-also we-thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious-hating one another;
003:004 and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear
003:005 (not by works that are in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,
003:006 which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,
003:007 that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.
003:008 Stedfast is the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works-who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,
003:009 and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from-for they are unprofitable and vain.
003:010 A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,
003:011 having known that he hath been subverted who is such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.
003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.
003:013 Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,
003:014 and let them learn-ours also-to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
003:015 Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace is with you all!
