001:001 ¶  In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,
001:002 in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;
001:003 who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might-through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,
001:004 having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they.
001:005 For to which of the messengers said He ever, ‘My Son thou art-I to-day have begotten thee?’ and again, ‘I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?’
001:006 and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, ‘And let them bow before him-all messengers of God;’
001:007 and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, ‘Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;’
001:008 and unto the Son: ‘Thy throne, O God, is to the age of the age; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy reign;
001:009 thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint thee-God, thy God-with oil of gladness above thy partners;’
001:010 and, ‘Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found, and a work of thy hands are the heavens;
001:011 these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,
001:012 and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.’
001:013 And unto which of the messengers said He ever, ‘Sit at My right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?’
001:014 are they not all spirits of service-for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?
002:001 ¶  Because of this it behoveth us more abundantly to take heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside,
002:002 for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense,
002:003 how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation? which a beginning receiving-to be spoken through the Lord-by those having heard was confirmed to us,
002:004 God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will.
002:005 For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak,
002:006 and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, ‘What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, or a son of man, that Thou dost look after him?
002:007 Thou didst make him some little less than messengers, with glory and honour Thou didst crown him, and didst set him over the works of Thy hands,
002:008 all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet,’ for in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things subjected to him,
002:009 and him who was made some little less than messengers we see-Jesus-because of the suffering of the death, with glory and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death.
002:010 For it was becoming to Him, because of whom are the all things, and through whom are the all things, many sons to glory bringing, the author of their salvation through sufferings to make perfect,
002:011 for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified are all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
002:012 saying, ‘I will declare Thy name to my brethren, in the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to Thee;’ and again, ‘I will be trusting on Him;’
002:013 and again, ‘Behold I and the children that God did give to me.’
002:014 Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death-that is, the devil-
002:015 and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,
002:016 for, doubtless, of messengers it doth not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it layeth hold,
002:017 wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people,
002:018 for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
003:001 ¶  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,
003:002 being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,
003:003 for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it,
003:004 for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build is God,
003:005 and Moses indeed was stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,
003:006 and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast.
003:007 Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear-
003:008 ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,
003:009 in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;
003:010 wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;
003:011 so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest-!’)
003:012 See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,
003:013 but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,
003:014 for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,
003:015 in its being said, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,’
003:016 for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;
003:017 but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
003:018 and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe?-
003:019 and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
004:001 ¶  We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,
004:002 for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,
004:003 for we do enter into the rest-we who did believe, as He said, ‘So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest-;’ and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,
004:004 for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh day thus: ‘And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;’
004:005 and in this place again, ‘If they shall enter into My rest-;’
004:006 since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief-
004:007 again He doth limit a certain day, ‘To-day,’ (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,’
004:008 for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;
004:009 there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,
004:010 for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.
004:011 May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,
004:012 for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;
004:013 and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and open to His eyes-with whom is our reckoning.
004:014 Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens-Jesus the Son of God-may we hold fast the profession,
004:015 for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but one tempted in all things in like manner-apart from sin;
004:016 we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace-for seasonable help.
005:001 ¶  For every chief priest-out of men taken-in behalf of men is set in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,
005:002 able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since himself also is compassed with infirmity;
005:003 and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins;
005:004 and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:
005:005 so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: ‘My Son thou art, I to-day have begotten thee;’
005:006 as also in another place He saith, ‘Thou art a priest-to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;’
005:007 who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death-with strong crying and tears-having offered up, and having been heard in respect to that which he feared,
005:008 through being a Son, did learn by the things which he suffered-the obedience,
005:009 and having been made perfect, he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,
005:010 having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to the order of Melchisedek,
005:011 concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing,
005:012 for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again ye have need that one teach you what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and ye have become having need of milk, and not of strong food,
005:013 for every one who is partaking of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness-for he is an infant,
005:014 and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both of good and of evil.
006:001 ¶  Wherefore, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith on God,
006:002 of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during,
006:003 and this we will do, if God may permit,
006:004 for it is impossible for those once enlightened, having tasted also of the heavenly gift, and partakers having became of the Holy Spirit,
006:005 and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the coming age,
006:006 and having fallen away, again to renew them to reformation, having crucified again to themselves the Son of God, and exposed to public shame.
006:007 For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom also it is dressed, doth partake of blessing from God,
006:008 and that which is bearing thorns and briers is disapproved of, and nigh to cursing, whose end is for burning;
006:009 and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus we speak,
006:010 for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labour of the love, that ye shewed to His name, having ministered to the saints and ministering;
006:011 and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew, unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end,
006:012 that ye may not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises.
006:013 For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself,
006:014 saying, ‘Blessing indeed I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;’
006:015 and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the promise;
006:016 for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all controversy to them for confirmation is the oath,
006:017 in which God, more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose by an oath,
006:018 that through two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, a strong comfort we may have who did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us,
006:019 which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and entering into that within the vail,
006:020 whither a forerunner for us did enter-Jesus, after the order of Melchisedek chief priest having become-to the age.
007:001 ¶  For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,
007:002 to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, ‘King of righteousness,’ and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)
007:003 without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.
007:004 And see how great this one is, to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,
007:005 and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;
007:006 and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,
007:007 and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed-
007:008 and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there he, who is testified to that he was living,
007:009 and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,
007:010 for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.
007:011 If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood-for the people under it had received law-what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?
007:012 for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,
007:013 for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,
007:014 for it is evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
007:015 And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,
007:016 who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,
007:017 for He doth testify-‘Thou art a priest-to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;’
007:018 for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,
007:019 (for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.
007:020 And inasmuch as it is not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,
007:021 and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, ‘The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest-to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;’)
007:022 by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,
007:023 and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;
007:024 and he, because of his remaining-to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,
007:025 whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God-ever living to make intercession for them.
007:026 For such a chief priest did become us-kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,
007:027 who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;
007:028 for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that is after the law appointeth the Son-to the age having been perfected.
008:001 ¶  And the sum concerning the things spoken of is: we have such a chief priest, who did sit down at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens,
008:002 of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord did set up, and not man,
008:003 for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence it is necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer;
008:004 for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest-(there being the priests who are offering according to the law, the gifts,
008:005 who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things, as Moses hath been divinely warned, being about to construct the tabernacle, for ‘See (saith He) thou mayest make all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in the mount;’)-
008:006 and now he hath obtained a more excellent service, how much also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better promises hath been sanctioned,
008:007 for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.
008:008 For finding fault, He saith to them, ‘Lo, days come, saith the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant,
008:009 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking them by their hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt-because they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not regard them, saith the Lord,-
008:010 because this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws into their mind, and upon their hearts I will write them, and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to Me for a people;
008:011 and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his brother, saying, Know thou the Lord, because they shall all know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them,
008:012 because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;’-
008:013 in the saying ‘new,’ He hath made the first old, and what doth become obsolete and is old is nigh disappearing.
009:001 ¶  It had, indeed, then (even the first tabernacle) ordinances of service, also a worldly sanctuary,
009:002 for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence-which is called ‘Holy;’
009:003 and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called ‘Holy of holies,’
009:004 having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all round about with gold, in which is the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of the covenant,
009:005 and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat, concerning which we are not now to speak particularly.
009:006 And these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in, performing the services,
009:007 and into the second, once in the year, only the chief priest, not apart from blood, which he doth offer for himself and the errors of the people,
009:008 the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been manifested the way of the holy places, the first tabernacle having yet a standing;
009:009 which is a simile in regard to the present time, in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are not able, in regard to conscience, to make perfect him who is serving,
009:010 only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and fleshly ordinances-till the time of reformation imposed upon them.
009:011 And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands-that is, not of this creation-
009:012 neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during redemption having obtained;
009:013 for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an heifer, sprinkling those defiled, doth sanctify to the purifying of the flesh,
009:014 how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
009:015 And because of this, of a new covenant he is mediator, that, death having come, for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise of the age-during inheritance,
009:016 for where a covenant is, the death of the covenant-victim to come in is necessary,
009:017 for a covenant over dead victims is stedfast, since it is no force at all when the covenant-victim liveth,
009:018 whence not even the first apart from blood hath been initiated,
009:019 for every command having been spoken, according to law, by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both the book itself and all the people did sprinkle,
009:020 saying, ‘This is the blood of the covenant that God enjoined unto you,’
009:021 and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner he did sprinkle,
009:022 and with blood almost all things are purified according to the law, and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness doth not come.
009:023 It is necessary, therefore, the pattern indeed of the things in the heavens to be purified with these, and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these;
009:024 for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ enter-figures of the true-but into the heaven itself, now to be manifested in the presence of God for us;
009:025 nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief priest doth enter into the holy places every year with blood of others;
009:026 since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the foundation of the world, but now once, at the full end of the ages, for putting away of sin through his sacrifice, he hath been manifested;
009:027 and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this-judgment,
009:028 so also the Christ, once having been offered to bear the sins of many, a second time, apart from a sin-offering, shall appear, to those waiting for him-to salvation!
010:001 ¶  For the law having a shadow of the coming good things-not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near,
010:002 since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?
010:003 but in those sacrifices is a remembrance of sins every year,
010:004 for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
010:005 Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, ‘Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare for me,
010:006 in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou didst not delight,
010:007 then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;’
010:008 saying above-‘Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering Thou didst not will, nor delight in,’-which according to the law are offered-
010:009 then he said, ‘Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;’ he doth take away the first that the second he may establish;
010:010 in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,
010:011 and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins.
010:012 And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered-to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God,-
010:013 as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies as his footstool,
010:014 for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified;
010:015 and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after that He hath said before,
010:016 ‘This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,’
010:017 and ‘their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;’
010:018 and where forgiveness of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
010:019 Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,
010:020 which way he did initiate for us-new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh-
010:021 and a high priest over the house of God,
010:022 may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;
010:023 may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful is He who did promise),
010:024 and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,
010:025 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain is, but exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh.
010:026 For we-wilfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth-no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice,
010:027 but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;
010:028 any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,
010:029 of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?
010:030 for we have known Him who is saying, ‘Vengeance is Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;’ and again, ‘The Lord shall judge His people;’-
010:031 fearful is the falling into the hands of a living God.
010:032 And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of sufferings,
010:033 partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,
010:034 for also with my bonds ye sympathised, and the robbery of your goods with joy ye did receive, knowing that ye have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one.
010:035 Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward,
010:036 for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having done, ye may receive the promise,
010:037 for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry;
010:038 and ‘the righteous by faith shall live,’ and ‘if he may draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,’
010:039 and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul.
011:001 ¶  And faith is of things hoped for a confidence, of matters not seen a conviction,
011:002 for in this were the elders testified of;
011:003 by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come out of things appearing;
011:004 by faith a better sacrifice did Abel offer to God than Cain, through which he was testified to be righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and through it, he being dead, doth yet speak.
011:005 By faith Enoch was translated-not to see death, and was not found, because God did translate him; for before his translation he had been testified to-that he had pleased God well,
011:006 and apart from faith it is impossible to please well, for it behoveth him who is coming to God to believe that He is, and to those seeking Him He becometh a rewarder.
011:007 By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the things not yet seen, having feared, did prepare an ark to the salvation of his house, through which he did condemn the world, and of the righteousness according to faith he became heir.
011:008 By faith Abraham, being called, did obey, to go forth to the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went forth, not knowing whither he doth go;
011:009 by faith he did sojourn in the land of the promise as a strange country, in tabernacles having dwelt with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise,
011:010 for he was looking for the city having the foundations, whose artificer and constructor is God.
011:011 By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive seed, and she bare after the time of life, seeing she did judge Him faithful who did promise;
011:012 wherefore, also from one were begotten-and that of one who had become dead-as the stars of the heaven in multitude, and as sand that is by the sea-shore-the innumerable.
011:013 In faith died all these, not having received the promises, but from afar having seen them, and having been persuaded, and having saluted them, and having confessed that strangers and sojourners they are upon the earth,
011:014 for those saying such things make manifest that they seek a country;
011:015 and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return,
011:016 but now they long for a better, that is, an heavenly, wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He did prepare for them a city.
011:017 By faith Abraham hath offered up Isaac, being tried, and the only begotten he did offer up who did receive the promises,
011:018 of whom it was said-‘In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;’
011:019 reckoning that even out of the dead God is able to raise up, whence also in a figure he did receive him.
011:020 By faith, concerning coming things, Isaac did bless Jacob and Esau;
011:021 by faith Jacob dying-each of the sons of Joseph did bless, and did bow down upon the top of his staff;
011:022 by faith, Joseph dying, concerning the outgoing of the sons of Israel did make mention, and concerning his bones did give command.
011:023 By faith Moses, having been born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child comely, and were not afraid of the decree of the king;
011:024 by faith Moses, having become great, did refuse to be called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh,
011:025 having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have sin’s pleasure for a season,
011:026 greater wealth having reckoned the reproach of the Christ than the treasures in Egypt, for he did look to the recompense of reward;
011:027 by faith he left Egypt behind, not having been afraid of the wrath of the king, for, as seeing the Invisible One-he endured;
011:028 by faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that He who is destroying the first-born might not touch them.
011:029 By faith they did pass through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the Egyptians having received a trial of, were swallowed up;
011:030 by faith the walls of Jericho did fall, having been surrounded for seven days;
011:031 by faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who disbelieved, having received the spies with peace.
011:032 And what shall I yet say? for the time will fail me recounting about Gideon, Barak also, and Samson, and Jephthah, David also, and Samuel, and the prophets,
011:033 who through faith did subdue kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions,
011:034 quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were made powerful out of infirmities, became strong in battle, caused to give way camps of the aliens.
011:035 Women received by a rising again their dead, and others were tortured, not accepting the redemption, that a better rising again they might receive,
011:036 and others of mockings and scourgings did receive trial, and yet of bonds and imprisonment;
011:037 they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried; in the killing of the sword they died; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins-being destitute, afflicted, injuriously treated,
011:038 of whom the world was not worthy; in deserts wandering, and in mountains, and in caves, and in the holes of the earth;
011:039 and these all, having been testified to through the faith, did not receive the promise,
011:040 God for us something better having provided, that apart from us they might not be made perfect.
012:001 ¶  Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set around us, every weight having put off, and the closely besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that is set before us,
012:002 looking to the author and perfecter of faith-Jesus, who, over-against the joy set before him-did endure a cross, shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of God did sit down;
012:003 for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the sinners to himself, that ye may not be wearied in your souls-being faint.
012:004 Not yet unto blood did ye resist-with the sin striving;
012:005 and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully with you as with sons, ‘My son, be not despising chastening of the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,
012:006 for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten, and He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;’
012:007 if chastening ye endure, as to sons God beareth Himself to you, for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten?
012:008 and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have become partakers, then bastards are ye, and not sons.
012:009 Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising us, and we were reverencing them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live?
012:010 for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be partakers of His separation;
012:011 and all chastening for the present, indeed, doth not seem to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it-it doth yield.
012:012 Wherefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees set ye up;
012:013 and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed;
012:014 peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from which no one shall see the Lord,
012:015 looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;
012:016 lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright,
012:017 for ye know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he found not, though with tears having sought it.
012:018 For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
012:019 and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them,
012:020 for they were not bearing that which is commanded, ‘And if a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an arrow shot through,’
012:021 and, (so terrible was the sight,) Moses said, ‘I am fearful exceedingly, and trembling.’
012:022 But, ye came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,
012:023 to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect,
012:024 and to a mediator of a new covenant-Jesus, and to blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!
012:025 See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking-much less we who do turn away from him who speaketh from heaven,
012:026 whose voice the earth shook then, and now hath he promised, saying, ‘Yet once-I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven;’
012:027 and this-‘Yet once’-doth make evident the removal of the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the things not shaken may remain;
012:028 wherefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly, with reverence and religious fear;
012:029 for also our God is a consuming fire.
013:001 ¶  Let brotherly love remain;
013:002 of the hospitality be not forgetful, for through this unawares certain did entertain messengers;
013:003 be mindful of those in bonds, as having been bound with them, of those maltreated, as also yourselves being in the body;
013:004 honourable is the marriage in all, and the bed undefiled, and whoremongers and adulterers God shall judge.
013:005 Without covetousness the behaviour, being content with the things present, for He hath said, ‘No, I will not leave, no, nor forsake thee,’
013:006 so that we do boldly say, ‘The Lord is to me a helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.’
013:007 Be mindful of those leading you, who did speak to you the word of God, whose faith-considering the issue of the behaviour-be imitating,
013:008 Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same, and to the ages;
013:009 with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about, for it is good that by grace the heart be confirmed, not with meats, in which they who were occupied were not profited;
013:010 we have an altar, of which to eat they have no authority who the tabernacle are serving,
013:011 for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest-of these the bodies are burned without the camp.
013:012 Wherefore, also Jesus-that he might sanctify through his own blood the people-without the gate did suffer;
013:013 now, then, may we go forth unto him without the camp, his reproach bearing;
013:014 for we have not here an abiding city, but the coming one we seek;
013:015 through him, then, we may offer up a sacrifice of praise always to God, that is, the fruit of lips, giving thanks to His name;
013:016 and of doing good, and of fellowship, be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased.
013:017 Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for these do watch for your souls, as about to give account, that with joy they may do this, and not sighing, for this is unprofitable to you.
013:018 Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, in all things willing to behave well,
013:019 and more abundantly do I call upon you to do this, that more quickly I may be restored to you.
013:020 And the God of the peace, who did bring up out of the dead the great shepherd of the sheep-in the blood of an age-during covenant-our Lord Jesus,
013:021 make you perfect in every good work to do His will, doing in you that which is well-pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory-to the ages of the ages! Amen.
013:022 And I entreat you, brethren, suffer the word of the exhortation, for also through few words I have written to you.
013:023 Know ye that the brother Timotheus is released, with whom, if he may come more shortly, I will see you.
013:024 Salute all those leading you, and all the saints; salute you doth those from Italy:
013:025 the grace is with you all! Amen.
