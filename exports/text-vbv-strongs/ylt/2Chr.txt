001:001 ¶  And strengthen himself doth Solomon son of David over his kingdom, and Jehovah his God is with him, and maketh him exceedingly great.
001:002 And Solomon saith to all Israel, to heads of the thousands, and of the hundreds, and to judges, and to every honourable one of all Israel, heads of the fathers,
001:003 and they go-Solomon, and all the assembly with him-to the high place that is in Gibeon, for there hath been God’s tent of meeting, that Moses, servant of Jehovah, made in the wilderness,
001:004 but the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-Jearim, when David prepared for it, for he stretched out for it a tent in Jerusalem;
001:005 and the altar of brass that Bezaleel son of Uri, son of Hur made, he put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and the assembly seek to it.
001:006 And Solomon goeth up thither, on the altar of brass, before Jehovah, that is at the tent of meeting, and causeth to ascend upon it a thousand burnt-offerings.
001:007 In that night hath God appeared to Solomon, and saith to him, ‘Ask-what do I give to thee?’
001:008 And Solomon saith to God, ‘Thou hast done with David my father great kindness, and hast caused me to reign in his stead.
001:009 Now, O Jehovah God, is Thy word with David my father stedfast, for Thou hast caused me to reign over a people numerous as the dust of the earth;
001:010 now, wisdom and knowledge give to me, and I go out before this people, and I come in, for who doth judge this Thy great people?’
001:011 And God saith to Solomon, ‘Because that this hath been with thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, and honour, and the life of those hating thee, and also many days hast not asked, and dost ask for thyself wisdom and knowledge, so that thou dost judge My people over which I have caused thee to reign-
001:012 the wisdom and the knowledge is given to thee, and riches and wealth and honour I give to thee, that there hath not been so to the kings who are before thee, and after thee it is not so.’
001:013 And Solomon cometh in from the high place that is in Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and reigneth over Israel,
001:014 and Solomon gathereth chariots and horsemen, and he hath a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placeth them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.
001:015 And the king maketh the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars he made as sycamores that are in the low country, for abundance.
001:016 And the source of the horses that are to Solomon is from Egypt and from Keva; merchants of the king from Keva take at a price,
001:017 and they come up, and bring out from Egypt a chariot for six hundred silverlings, and a horse for fifty and a hundred, and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Aram-by their hand they bring out.
002:001 ¶  And Solomon saith to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom,
002:002 and Solomon numbereth seventy thousand men bearing burden, and eighty thousand men hewing in the mountain, and overseers over them-three thousand and six hundred.
002:003 And Solomon sendeth unto Huram king of Tyre, saying, ‘When thou hast dealt with David my father, then thou dost send to him cedars to build for him a house to dwell in;
002:004 lo, I am building a house to the name of Jehovah my God, to sanctify it to Him, to make perfume before Him, perfume of spices, and a continual arrangement, and burnt-offerings at morning and at evening, at sabbaths, and at new moons, and at appointed seasons of Jehovah our God; to the age this is on Israel.
002:005 ‘And the house that I am building is great, for greater is our God than all gods;
002:006 and who doth retain strength to build to Him a house, for the heavens, even the heavens of the heavens, do not contain Him? and who am I that I do build to Him a house, except to make perfume before Him?
002:007 ‘And now, send to me a wise man to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and knowing to grave gravings with the wise men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father prepared;
002:008 and send to me cedar-trees, firs, and algums from Lebanon, for I have known that thy servants know to cut down trees of Lebanon, and lo, my servants are with thy servants,
002:009 even to prepare for me trees in abundance, for the house that I am building is great and wonderful.
002:010 ‘And lo, to hewers, to those cutting the trees, I have given beaten wheat to thy servants, cors twenty thousand, and barley, cors twenty thousand, and wine, baths twenty thousand, and oil, baths twenty thousand.’
002:011 And Huram king of Tyre saith in writing, and sendeth unto Solomon: ‘In the love of Jehovah to His people He hath given thee king over them.’
002:012 And Huram saith, ‘Blessed is Jehovah, God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, knowing wisdom and understanding, who doth build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
002:013 ‘And now, I have sent a wise man having understanding, of Huram my father,
002:014 (son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father a man of Tyre), knowing to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stones, and in wood, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, and to grave any graving, and to devise any device that is given to him, with thy wise men, and the wise men of my lord David thy father.
002:015 ‘And, now, the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, as my lord said, let him send to his servants,
002:016 and we-we cut trees out of Lebanon, according to all thy need, and bring them in to thee-floats by sea, to Joppa, and thou dost take them up to Jerusalem.’
002:017 And Solomon numbereth all the men, the sojourners who are in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father numbered them, and they are found a hundred and fifty thousand, and three thousand, and six hundred;
002:018 and he maketh of them seventy thousand burden-bearers, and eighty thousand hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers, to cause the people to work.
003:001 ¶  And Solomon beginneth to build the house of Jehovah, in Jerusalem, in the mount of Moriah, where He appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,
003:002 and he beginneth to build in the second day, in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
003:003 And in these hath Solomon been instructed to build the house of God: The length in cubits by the former measure is sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
003:004 As to the porch that is on the front, the length is by the front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty, and he overlayeth it within with pure gold.
003:005 And the large house he hath covered with fir-trees, and he doth cover it with good gold, and causeth to ascend on it palms and chains,
003:006 and he overlayeth the house with precious stone for beauty, and the gold is gold of Parvaim,
003:007 and he covereth the house, the beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold, and hath graved cherubs on the walls.
003:008 And he maketh the most holy house: its length is by the front of the breadth of the house twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits, and he covereth it with good gold, to six hundred talents;
003:009 and the weight of the nails is fifty shekels of gold, and the upper chambers he hath covered with gold.
003:010 And he maketh in the most holy house two cherubs, image work, and he overlayeth them with gold;
003:011 as to the wings of the cherubs, their length is twenty cubits, the wing of the one is five cubits, touching the wall of the house, and the other wing is five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub.
003:012 And the wing of the other cherub is five cubits touching the wall of the house, and the other wing is five cubits, adhering to the wing of the other cherub.
003:013 The wings of these cherubs are spreading forth twenty cubits, and they are standing on their feet and their faces are inward.
003:014 And he maketh the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and causeth cherubs to go up on it.
003:015 And he maketh at the front of the house two pillars, thirty and five cubits in length, and the ornament that is on their heads five cubits.
003:016 And he maketh chains in the oracle, and putteth on the heads of the pillars, and maketh a hundred pomegranates, and putteth on the chains.
003:017 And he raiseth up the pillars on the front of the temple, one on the right, and one on the left, and calleth the name of that on the right Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
004:001 ¶  And he maketh an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.
004:002 And he maketh the molten sea; ten by the cubit, from its edge unto its edge, round in compass, and five by the cubit its height, and a line of thirty by the cubit doth compass it, round about.
004:003 And the likeness of oxen is under it, all round about encompassing it, ten in the cubit, compassing the sea round about; two rows of oxen are cast in its being cast.
004:004 It is standing on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east, and the sea is upon them above, and all their hinder parts are within.
004:005 And its thickness is a handbreadth, and its lip as the work of the lip of a cup flowered with lilies; taking hold-baths three thousand it containeth.
004:006 And he maketh ten lavers, and putteth five on the right, and five on the left, to wash with them; the work of the burnt-offering they purge with them; and the sea is for priests to wash with.
004:007 And he maketh the ten candlesticks of gold, according to their ordinance, and placeth in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left.
004:008 And he maketh ten tables, and placeth in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left; and he maketh bowls of gold a hundred.
004:009 And he maketh the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and their doors he hath overlaid with brass.
004:010 And the sea he hath placed on the right shoulder eastward, over-against the south.
004:011 And Huram maketh the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls, and Huram finisheth to make the work that he made for king Solomon in the house of God;
004:012 two pillars, and the bowls, and the crowns on the heads of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two bowls of the crowns that are on the heads of the pillars;
004:013 and the pomegranates four hundred to the two wreaths, two rows of pomegranates to the one wreath, to cover the two bowls of the crowns that are on the front of the pillars.
004:014 And the bases he hath made; and the lavers he hath made on the bases;
004:015 the one sea, and the twelve oxen under it,
004:016 and the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their vessels, hath Huram his father made for king Solomon, for the house of Jehovah, of brass purified.
004:017 In the circuit of the Jordan hath the king cast them, in the thick soil of the ground, between Succoth and Zeredathah.
004:018 And Solomon maketh all these vessels in great abundance, that the weight of the brass hath not been searched out.
004:019 And Solomon maketh all the vessels that are for the house of God, and the altar of gold, and the tables, and on them is bread of the presence;
004:020 and the candlesticks, and their lamps, for their burning according to the ordinance, before the oracle, of gold refined;
004:021 and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold-it is the perfection of gold;
004:022 and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the censers, of gold refined, and the opening of the house, its innermost doors to the holy of holies, and the doors of the house to the temple, of gold.
005:001 ¶  And all the work that Solomon made for the house of Jehovah is finished, and Solomon bringeth in the sanctified things of David his father, and the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he hath put among the treasures of the house of God.
005:002 Then doth Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, princes of the fathers of the sons of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the city of David-it is Zion.
005:003 And assembled unto the king are all the men of Israel in the feast-it is the seventh month;
005:004 and all the elders of Israel come in, and the Levites lift up the ark,
005:005 and they bring up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the vessels of the sanctuary that are in the tent; brought them up have the priests, the Levites;
005:006 and king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are convened unto him before the ark are sacrificing sheep and oxen, that are not counted nor numbered from multitude.
005:007 And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, unto the oracle of the house, unto the holy of holies, unto the place of the wings of the cherubs;
005:008 and the cherubs are spreading out wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs cover over the ark, and over its staves, from above;
005:009 and they lengthen the staves, and the heads of the staves are seen out of the ark on the front of the oracle, and they are not seen without; and it is there unto this day.
005:010 There is nothing in the ark but the two tables that Moses gave in Horeb, where Jehovah covenanted with the sons of Israel, in their going out from Egypt.
005:011 And it cometh to pass, in the going out of the priests from the sanctuary-for all the priests who are present have sanctified themselves, there is none to watch by courses,
005:012 and the Levites, the singers, to all of them, to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons, and to their brethren, clothed in white linen, with cymbals, and with psalteries, and harps, are standing on the east of the altar, and with them priests, to a hundred and twenty, blowing with trumpets-
005:013 yea, it cometh to pass, as one are trumpeters and singers, to sound-one voice-to praise and to give thanks to Jehovah, and at the lifting up of the sound with trumpets, and with cymbals, and with instruments of song, and at giving praise to Jehovah, for good, for to the age is His kindness, that the house is filled with a cloud-the house of Jehovah,
005:014 and the priests have not been able to stand to minister from the presence of the cloud, for the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house of God.
006:001 ¶  Then said Solomon, ‘Jehovah said-to dwell in thick darkness,
006:002 and I-I have built a house of habitation for Thee, and a fixed place for Thy dwelling to the ages.’
006:003 And the king turneth round his face, and blesseth the whole assembly of Israel, and the whole assembly of Israel is standing,
006:004 and he saith, ‘Blessed is Jehovah, God of Israel, who hath spoken with His mouth with David my father, and with His hands hath fulfilled it, saying:
006:005 ‘From the day that I brought out My people from the land of Egypt, I have not fixed on a city out of any of the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name being there, and I have not fixed on a man to be leader over My people Israel;
006:006 and I fix on Jerusalem for My name being there, and I fix on David to be over My people Israel.
006:007 ‘And it is with the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah God of Israel,
006:008 and Jehovah saith unto David my father, Because that it hath been with thy heart to build a house for My name, thou hast done well that it hath been with thy heart,
006:009 but thou dost not build the house, for thy son who cometh forth out from thy loins, he doth build the house for My name.
006:010 ‘And Jehovah doth establish His word that He spake, and I rise up in the stead of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah spake, and I build the house for the name of Jehovah, God of Israel,
006:011 and I place there the ark, where is the covenant of Jehovah that He made with the sons of Israel.’
006:012 And he standeth before the altar of Jehovah, over-against all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth out his hand,-
006:013 for Solomon hath made a scaffold of brass, and putteth it in the midst of the court, five cubits its length, and five cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height, and he standeth upon it, and kneeleth on his knees over-against all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth forth his hands towards the heavens-
006:014 and saith, ‘O Jehovah God of Israel, there is not like Thee a god in the heavens and in the earth, keeping the covenant and the kindness for Thy servants who are walking before Thee with all their heart;
006:015 who hast kept for Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst speak to him; yea, Thou dost speak with Thy mouth, and with Thy hand hast fulfilled it, as at this day.
006:016 ‘And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, keep for Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst speak to him, saying, There is not cut off to thee a man from before Me, sitting on the throne of Israel, only, if thy sons watch their way to walk in My law, as thou hast walked before Me.
006:017 ‘And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, is Thy word stedfast that Thou hast spoken to Thy servant, to David,
006:018 (for is it true?-God dwelleth with man on the earth! Lo, the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, do not contain Thee, how much less this house that I have built?)
006:019 ‘And Thou hast turned unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and unto the prayer that Thy servant is praying before Thee,
006:020 for Thine eyes being open towards this house by day and by night, towards the place that Thou hast said to put Thy name there, to hearken unto the prayer that Thy servant prayeth towards this place.
006:021 ‘And Thou hast hearkened unto the supplications of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, that they pray towards this place, and Thou dost hear from the place of Thy dwelling, from the heavens, and hast hearkened, and forgiven.
006:022 ‘If a man doth sin against his neighbour, and he hath lifted up on him an oath to cause him to swear, and the oath hath come in before Thine altar in this house-
006:023 then Thou dost hear from the heavens, and hast done, and hast judged Thy servants, to give back to the wicked, to put his way on his head, and to declare righteous the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness.
006:024 ‘And if Thy people Israel is smitten before an enemy, because they sin against Thee, and they have turned back and confessed Thy name, and prayed and made supplication before Thee in this house-
006:025 then Thou dost hear from the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy people Israel, and caused them to turn back unto the ground that Thou hast given to them, and to their fathers.
006:026 ‘In the heavens being restrained, and there is no rain, because they sin against Thee, and they have prayed towards this place, and confessed Thy name-from their sin they turn back because Thou dost afflict them-
006:027 then Thou dost hear in the heavens, and hast forgiven the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, because Thou directest them unto the good way in which they walk, and hast given rain on Thy land that Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance.
006:028 ‘Famine, when it is in the land, pestilence, when it is, blasting, and mildew, locust, and caterpillar, when they are, when its enemies have distressed it in the land-its gates, any plague and any sickness;
006:029 any prayer, any supplication that is for any man, and for all Thy people Israel, when they know each his own plague, and his own pain, and he hath spread out his hands towards this house:
006:030 then Thou dost hear from the heavens, the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast forgiven, and hast given to each according to all his ways (because Thou knowest his heart, for Thou-Thou only-hast known the heart of the sons of men),
006:031 so that they fear Thee, to walk in Thy ways, all the days that they are living on the face of the ground that Thou hast given to our fathers.
006:032 ‘And also, unto the stranger who is not of Thy people Israel, and he hath come from a land afar off for the sake of Thy great name, and Thy strong hand, and Thy stretched-out arm, and they have come in and prayed towards this house:
006:033 then Thou dost hear from the heavens, from the settled place of Thy dwelling, and hast done according to all that the stranger calleth unto Thee for: so that all the peoples of the earth do know Thy name, so as to fear Thee, as Thy people Israel, and to know that Thy name is called on this house that I have built.
006:034 ‘When Thy people doth go out to battle against its enemies in the way that Thou dost send them, and they have prayed unto Thee the way of this city that Thou hast fixed on, and the house that I have built for Thy name:
006:035 then Thou hast heard from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and hast maintained their cause.
006:036 ‘When they sin against Thee-for there is not a man who sinneth not-and Thou hast been angry with them, and hast given them before an enemy, and taken them captive have their captors, unto a land far off or near;
006:037 and they have turned it back unto their heart in the land whither they have been taken captive, and have turned back, and made supplication unto Thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have done wickedly;
006:038 yea, they have turned back unto Thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity, whither they have taken them captive, and they have prayed the way of their land that Thou hast given to their fathers, and of the city that Thou hast chosen, and of the house that I have built for Thy name:
006:039 then Thou hast heard from the heavens, from the settled place of Thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications, and hast maintained their cause, and forgiven Thy people who have sinned against Thee.
006:040 ‘Now, my God, let, I beseech Thee, Thine eyes be open, and Thine ears attentive, to the prayer of this place:
006:041 and now, rise, O Jehovah God, to Thy rest, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength; Thy priests, O Jehovah God, are clothed with salvation, and Thy saints rejoice in the goodness,
006:042 O Jehovah God, turn not back the face of Thine anointed, be mindful of the kind acts of David Thy servant.’
007:001 ¶  And at Solomon’s finishing to pray, then the fire hath come down from the heavens, and consumeth the burnt-offering and the sacrifices, and the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house,
007:002 and the priests have not been able to go in unto the house of Jehovah, because the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house of Jehovah.
007:003 And all the sons of Israel are looking on the descending of the fire, and the honour of Jehovah on the house, and they bow-faces to the earth-on the pavement, and do obeisance, and give thanks to Jehovah, for good, for to the age is His kindness.
007:004 And the king and all the people are sacrificing a sacrifice before Jehovah,
007:005 and king Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of the herd, twenty and two thousand, and of the flock, a hundred and twenty thousand, and the king and all the people dedicate the house of God.
007:006 And the priests over their charges are standing, and the Levites with instruments of the song of Jehovah-that David the king made, to give thanks to Jehovah, for to the age is His kindness, in David’s praising by their hand-and the priests are blowing trumpets over-against them, and all Israel are standing.
007:007 And Solomon sanctifieth the middle of the court that is before the house of Jehovah, for he hath made there the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings: for the altar of brass that Solomon made hath not been able to contain the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat.
007:008 And solomon maketh the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him-a very great assembly-from the entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.
007:009 And they make on the eighth day a restraint, because the dedication of the altar they have made seven days, and the feast seven days.
007:010 And on the twenty and third day of the seventh month he hath sent the people to their tents, rejoicing, and glad in heart, for the goodness that Jehovah hath done to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel His people.
007:011 And Solomon finisheth the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king; and all that hath come on the heart of Solomon to do in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he hath caused to prosper.
007:012 And Jehovah appeareth unto Solomon by night, and saith to him, ‘I have heard thy prayer, and have fixed on this place to Me for a house of sacrifice.
007:013 If I restrain the heavens and there is no rain, and if I lay charge on the locust to consume the land, and if I send pestilence among My people-
007:014 and My people on whom My name is called be humbled, and pray, and seek My face, and turn back from their evil ways, then I-I hear from the heavens, and forgive their sin, and heal their land.
007:015 ‘Now, Mine eyes are open, and Mine ears attentive, to the prayer of this place;
007:016 and now, I have chosen and sanctified this house for My name being there unto the age; yea, Mine eyes and My heart have been there all the days.
007:017 ‘And thou, if thou dost walk before Me as David thy father walked, even to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and My statutes and My judgments dost keep-
007:018 then I have established the throne of thy kingdom, as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There is not cut off a man to thee-a ruler in Israel;
007:019 and if ye turn back-ye-and have forsaken My statutes, and My commands, that I have placed before you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them-then I have plucked them from off My ground that I have given to them,
007:020 and this house that I have sanctified for My name, I cast from before My face, and make it for a proverb, and for a byword, among all the peoples.
007:021 ‘And this house that hath been high, to every one passing by it, is an astonishment, and he hath said, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus to this land, and to this house?
007:022 and they have said, Because that they have forsaken Jehovah, God of their fathers, who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and lay hold on other gods, and bow themselves to them, and serve them, therefore He hath brought upon them all this evil.’
008:001 ¶  And it cometh to pass, at the end of twenty years, that Solomon hath built the house of Jehovah, and his own house.
008:002 As to the cities that Huram hath given to Solomon, Solomon hath built them, and there he causeth the sons of Israel to dwell.
008:003 And Solomon goeth to Hamath-Zobah, and layeth hold upon it;
008:004 and he buildeth Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the cities of store that he hath built in Hamath.
008:005 And he buildeth Beth-Horon the upper, and Beth-Horon the lower-cities of defence, with walls, two-leaved doors, and bar-
008:006 and Baalath, and all the cities of store that Solomon had, and all the cities of the chariot, and the cities of the horsemen, and all the desire of Solomon that he desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
008:007 All the people who are left of the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, who are not of Israel-
008:008 of their sons who have been left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel consumed not-doth Solomon lift up a tribute unto this day.
008:009 And none of the sons of Israel hath Solomon made servants for his work, but they are men of war, and heads of his captains, and heads of his charioteers, and of his horsemen;
008:010 and these are heads of the officers whom king Solomon hath, two hundred and fifty who are rulers among the people.
008:011 And the daughter of Pharaoh hath Solomon brought up from the city of David to the house that he built for her, for he said, ‘My wife doth not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, for they are holy unto whom hath come the ark of Jehovah.’
008:012 Then hath Solomon caused to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he built before the porch,
008:013 even by the matter of a day in its day, to cause to ascend according to the command of Moses, on sabbaths, and on new moons, and on appointed seasons, three times in a year-in the feast of unleavened things, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths.
008:014 And he establisheth, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests over their service, and of the Levites over their charges, to praise and to minister over-against the priests, according to the matter of a day in its day, and the gatekeepers in their courses at gate and gate, for so is the command of David the man of God.
008:015 And they have not turned aside from the command of the king concerning the priests and the Levites, in reference to any matter, and to the treasures.
008:016 And all the work of Solomon is prepared till the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and till its completion; perfect is the house of Jehovah.
008:017 Then hath Solomon gone to Ezion-Geber, and unto Elath, on the border of the sea, in the land of Edom;
008:018 and Huram sendeth to him, by the hand of his servants, ships and servants knowing the sea, and they go with servants of Solomon to Ophir, and take thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and bring in unto king Solomon.
009:001 ¶  And the queen of Sheba hath heard of the fame of Solomon, and cometh in to try Solomon with acute sayings, to Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels bearing spices and gold in abundance, and precious stone; and she cometh in unto Solomon, and speaketh with him all that hath been with her heart,
009:002 and Solomon declareth to her all her matters, and there hath not been hid a thing from Solomon that he hath not declared to her.
009:003 And the queen of Sheba seeth the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he hath built,
009:004 and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the standing of his ministers, and their clothing, and his stewards, and their clothing, an his burnt-offering that he offered up in the house of Jehovah, and there hath not been any more spirit in her.
009:005 And she saith unto the king, ‘True is the word that I heard in my land concerning thy matters and concerning thy wisdom,
009:006 and I have given no credence to their words, till that I have come, and mine eyes see, and lo, there hath not been declared to me the half of the abundance of thy wisdom-thou hast added unto the report that I heard.
009:007 ‘O the happiness of thy men, and the happiness of thy servants-these-who are standing before thee continually, and hearing thy wisdom.
009:008 Let Jehovah thy God be blessed who hath delighted in thee, to put thee on His throne for king for Jehovah thy God; in the love of thy God to Israel, to establish it to the age, He hath put thee over them for king, to do judgment and righteousness.’
009:009 And she giveth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stone; and there hath not been any such spice as the queen of Sheba hath given to king Solomon.
009:010 And also, servants of Huram, and servants of Solomon, who brought in gold from Ophir, have brought in algum-trees and precious stone.
009:011 And the king maketh the algum-trees staircases for the house of Jehovah, and for the house of the king, and harps and psalteries for singers; and there have been none seen like these before in the land of Judah.
009:012 And king Solomon hath given to the queen of Sheba all her desire that she asked, apart from that which she had brought unto the king, and she turneth and goeth to her land, she and her servants.
009:013 And the weight of the gold that is coming to Solomon in one year is six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold,
009:014 apart from what the tourists, and the merchants, are bringing in; and all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the land, are bringing in gold and silver to Solomon.
009:015 And king Solomon maketh two hundred targets of alloyed gold, six hundred shekels of alloyed gold he causeth to go up on the one target;
009:016 and three hundred shields of alloyed gold, three hundred shekels of gold he causeth to go up on the one shield, and the king putteth them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
009:017 And the king maketh a great throne of ivory, and overlayeth it with pure gold;
009:018 and six steps are to the throne, and a footstool of gold, to the throne they are fastened, and hands are on this side and on that on the place of the sitting, and two lions are standing near the hands,
009:019 and twelve lions are standing there on the six steps on this side, and on that: it hath not been made so for any kingdom.
009:020 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon are of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon are of refined gold-silver is not reckoned in the days of Solomon for anything;
009:021 for ships of the king are going to Tarshish, with servants of Huram: once in three years come do the ships of Tarshish bearing gold, and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
009:022 And king Solomon becometh greater than any of the kings of the earth for riches and wisdom;
009:023 and all the kings of the earth are seeking the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom that God hath put in his heart,
009:024 and they are bringing in each his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
009:025 And there are to Solomon four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placed them in cities of the chariot, and with the king in Jerusalem.
009:026 And he is ruling over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt.
009:027 And the king maketh the silver in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars he hath made as sycamores, that are in the low country, for abundance,
009:028 and they are bringing out horses from Egypt to Solomon, and from all the lands.
009:029 And the rest of the matters of Solomon, the first and the last, are they not written beside the matters of Nathan the prophet, and beside the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and with the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?
009:030 And Solomon reigneth in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years,
009:031 and Solomon lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David his father, and reign doth Rehoboam his son in his stead.
010:001 ¶  And Rehoboam goeth to Shechem, for to Shechem have all Israel come to cause him to reign.
010:002 And it cometh to pass, at Jeroboam son of Nebat’s-who is in Egypt because he hath fled from the face of Solomon the king-hearing, that Jeroboam turneth back out of Egypt;
010:003 and they send and call for him, and Jeroboam cometh in, and all Israel, and speak unto Rehoboam, saying,
010:004 ‘Thy father made our yoke sharp, and now, make light somewhat of the sharp service of thy father, and of his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we serve thee.’
010:005 And he saith unto them, ‘Yet three days-then return ye unto me;’ and the people go.
010:006 And king Rehoboam consulteth with the aged men who have been standing before Solomon his father in his being alive, saying, ‘How are ye counselling to answer this people?’
010:007 And they speak unto him, saying, ‘If thou dost become good to this people, and hast been pleased with them, and spoken unto them good words, then they have been to thee servants all the days.’
010:008 And he forsaketh the counsel of the aged men that they counselled him, and consulteth with the lads who have grown up with him, those standing before him,
010:009 and he saith unto them, ‘What are ye counselling, and we answer this people that have spoken unto me, saying, Make light somewhat of the yoke that thy father put upon us?’
010:010 And the lads who have grown up with him, speak with him, saying, ‘Thus dost thou say to the people who have spoken unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and thou, make light somewhat of our yoke; thus dost thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father;
010:011 and now, my father laid on you a heavy yoke, and I-I add unto your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I-with scorpions.’
010:012 And Jeroboam cometh in, and all the people, unto Rehoboam on the third day, as the king spake, saying, ‘Return unto me on the third day.’
010:013 And the king answereth them sharply, and king Rehoboam forsaketh the counsel of the aged men,
010:014 and speaketh unto them according to the counsel of the lads, saying, ‘My father made your yoke heavy, and I-I add unto it; my father chastised you with whips, and I-with scorpions.’
010:015 And the king hath not hearkened unto the people, for the revolution hath been from God, for the sake of Jehovah’s establishing His word that He spake by the hand of Abijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam son of Nebat.
010:016 And all Israel have seen that the king hath not hearkened to them, and the people send back to the king, saying, ‘What portion have we in David? yea, there is no inheritance in a son of Jesse; each to thy tents, O Israel; now, see thy house-David,’ and all Israel go to their tents.
010:017 As to the sons of Israel who are dwelling in the cities of Judah-Rehoboam reigneth over them.
010:018 And king Rehoboam sendeth Hadoram, who is over the tribute, and the sons of Israel cast at him stones, and he dieth; and king Rehoboam hath strengthened himself to go up into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem;
010:019 and Israel transgress against the house of David unto this day.
011:001 ¶  And Rehoboam cometh in to Jerusalem, and assembleth the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors, to fight with Israel, to bring back the kingdom to Rehoboam.
011:002 And a word of Jehovah is unto Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,
011:003 ‘Speak unto Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, and unto all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
011:004 Thus said Jehovah, Ye do not go up nor fight with your brethren, turn back each to his house, for from Me hath this thing been;’ and they hear the words of Jehovah, and turn back from going against Jeroboam.
011:005 And Rehoboam dwelleth in Jerusalem, and buildeth cities for a bulwark in Judah,
011:006 yea, he buildeth Beth-Lehem and Etam, and Tekoa,
011:007 and Beth-Zur, and Shocho, and Adullam,
011:008 and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
011:009 and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
011:010 and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, that are in Judah and in Benjamin, cities of bulwarks.
011:011 And he strengtheneth the bulwarks, and putteth in them leaders, and treasures of food, and oil, and wine,
011:012 and in every city and city targets and spears, and strengtheneth them very greatly; and he hath Judah and Benjamin.
011:013 And the priests, and the Levites, that are in all Israel, have stationed themselves by him, out of all their border,
011:014 for the Levites have left their suburbs and their possession, and they come to Judah and to Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons have cast them off from acting as priests to Jehovah,
011:015 and he establisheth to him priests for high places, and for goats, and for calves, that he made-
011:016 and after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, those giving their heart to seek Jehovah, God of Israel, have come in to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah, God of their father.
011:017 And they strengthen the kingdom of Judah, and strengthen Rehoboam son of Solomon, for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.
011:018 And Rehoboam taketh to him a wife, Mahalath, child of Jerimoth son of David, and Abigail daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse.
011:019 And she beareth to him sons, Jeush, and Shamaria, and Zaham.
011:020 And after her he hath taken Maachah daughter of Absalom, and she beareth to him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
011:021 And Rehoboam loveth Maachah daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines-for eighteen wives he hath taken, and sixty concubines-and he begetteth twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters.
011:022 And Rehoboam appointeth for head Abijah son of Maachah, for leader among his brethren, for to cause him to reign.
011:023 And he hath understanding, and spreadeth out of all his sons to all lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all cities of the bulwarks, and giveth to them provision in abundance; and he asketh a multitude of wives.
012:001 ¶  And it cometh to pass, at the establishing of the kingdom of Rehoboam, and at his strengthening himself, he hath forsaken the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.
012:002 And it cometh to pass, in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, come up hath Shishak king of Egypt against Jerusalem-because they trespassed against Jehovah-
012:003 with a thousand and two hundred chariots, and with sixty thousand horsemen, and there is no number to the people who have come with him out of Egypt-Lubim, Sukkiim, and Cushim-
012:004 and he captureth the cities of the bulwarks that are to Judah, and cometh in unto Jerusalem.
012:005 And Shemaiah the prophet hath come in unto Rehoboam and the heads of Judah who have been gathered unto Jerusalem from the presence of Shishak, and saith to them, ‘Thus said Jehovah, Ye have forsaken Me, and also, I have left you in the hand of Shishak;’
012:006 and the heads of Israel are humbled, and the king, and they say, ‘Righteous is Jehovah.’
012:007 And when Jehovah seeth that they have been humbled, a word of Jehovah hath been unto Shemaiah, saying, ‘They have been humbled; I do not destroy them, and I have given to them as a little thing for an escape, and I pour not out My fury in Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak;
012:008 but they become servants to him, and they know My service, and the service of the kingdoms of the lands.’
012:009 And Shishak king of Egypt cometh up against Jerusalem, and taketh the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the house of the king-the whole he hath taken-and he taketh the shields of gold that Solomon had made;
012:010 and king Rehoboam maketh in their stead shields of brass, and hath given them a charge on the hand of the heads of the runners who are keeping the opening of the house of the king;
012:011 and it cometh to pass, from the time of the going in of the king to the house of Jehovah, the runners have come in and lifted them up, and brought them back unto the chamber of the runners.
012:012 And in his being humbled, turned back from him hath the wrath of Jehovah, so as not to destroy to completion; and also, in Judah there have been good things.
012:013 And king Rehoboam strengtheneth himself in Jerusalem, and reigneth; for a son of forty and two years is Rehoboam in his reigning, and seventeen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah hath chosen to put His name there, out of all the tribes of Israel, and the name of his mother is Naamah the Ammonitess,
012:014 and he doth the evil thing, for he hath not prepared his heart to seek Jehovah.
012:015 And the matters of Rehoboam, the first and the last, are they not written among the matters of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer, concerning genealogy? And the wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam are all the days;
012:016 and Rehoboam lieth with his fathers, and is buried in the city of David, and reign doth Abijah his son in his stead.
013:001 ¶  In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam-Abijah reigneth over Judah;
013:002 three years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, (and the name of his mother is Michaiah daughter of Uriel, from Gibeah,) and war hath been between Abijah and Jeroboam.
013:003 And Abijah directeth the war with a force of mighty men of war, four hundred thousand chosen men, and Jeroboam hath set in array with him battle, with eight hundred thousand chosen men, mighty of valour.
013:004 And Abijah riseth up on the hill of Zemaraim that is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and saith, ‘Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel!
013:005 Is it not for you to know that Jehovah, God of Israel, hath given the kingdom to David over Israel to the age, to him and to his sons-a covenant of salt?
013:006 and rise up doth Jeroboam, son of Nebat, servant of Solomon son of David, and rebelleth against his lord!
013:007 ‘And there are gathered unto him vain men, sons of worthlessness, and they strengthen themselves against Rehoboam son of Solomon, and Rehoboam was a youth, and tender of heart, and hath not strengthened himself against them.
013:008 ‘And now, ye are saying to strengthen yourselves before the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David, and ye are a numerous multitude, and with you calves of gold that Jeroboam hath made to you for gods.
013:009 ‘Have ye not cast out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make to you priests like the peoples of the lands? every one who hath come to fill his hand with a bullock, a son of the herd, and seven rams, even he hath been a priest to No-gods!
013:010 ‘As for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken Him, and priests are ministering to Jehovah, sons of Aaron and the Levites, in the work,
013:011 and are making perfume to Jehovah, burnt-offerings morning by morning, and evening by evening, and perfume of spices, and the arrangement of bread is on the pure table, and the candlestick of gold, and its lamps, to burn evening by evening, for we are keeping the charge of Jehovah our God, and ye-ye have forsaken Him.
013:012 ‘And lo, with us-at our head-is God, and His priests and trumpets of shouting to shout against you; O sons of Israel, do not fight with Jehovah, God of your fathers, for ye do not prosper.’
013:013 And Jeroboam hath brought round the ambush to come in from behind them, and they are before Judah, and the ambush is behind them.
013:014 And Judah turneth, and lo, against them is the battle, before and behind, and they cry to Jehovah, and the priests are blowing with trumpets,
013:015 and the men of Judah shout-and it cometh to pass, at the shouting of the men of Judah, that God hath smitten Jeroboam, and all Israel, before Abijah and Judah.
013:016 And the sons of Israel flee from the face of Judah, and God giveth them into their hand,
013:017 and Abijah and his people smite among them a great smiting, and there fall wounded of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
013:018 And the sons of Israel are humbled at that time, and the sons of Judah are strong, for they have leant on Jehovah, God of their fathers.
013:019 And Abijah pursueth after Jeroboam, and captureth from him cities, Beth-El and its small towns, and Jeshanah and its small towns, and Ephraim and its small towns.
013:020 And Jeroboam hath not retained power any more in the days of Abijah, and Jehovah smiteth him, and he dieth.
013:021 And Abijah strengtheneth himself, and taketh to him fourteen wives, and begetteth twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters,
013:022 and the rest of the matters of Abijah, and his ways, and his words, are written in the ‘Inquiry’ of the prophet Iddo.
014:001 ¶  And Abijah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign doth Asa his son in his stead: in his days was the land quiet ten years.
014:002 And Asa doth that which is good, and that which is right, in the eyes of Jehovah his God,
014:003 and turneth aside the altars of the stranger, and the high places, and breaketh the standing-pillars, and cutteth down the shrines,
014:004 and saith to Judah to seek Jehovah, God of their fathers, and to do the law and the command;
014:005 and he turneth aside out of all cities of Judah the high places and the images, and the kingdom is quiet before him.
014:006 And he buildeth cities of bulwarks in Judah, for the land hath quiet, and there is no war with him in these years, because Jehovah hath given rest to him.
014:007 And he saith to Judah, ‘Let us build these cities, and compass them with wall, and towers, two-leaved doors, and bars, while the land is before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God, we have sought, and He giveth rest to us round about;’ and they build and prosper.
014:008 And there is to Asa a force bearing target and spear, out of Judah three hundred thousand, and out of Benjamin, bearing shield and treading bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these are mighty of valour.
014:009 And come out unto them doth Zerah the Cushite with a force of a thousand thousand, and chariots three hundred, and he cometh in unto Mareshah,
014:010 and Asa goeth out before him, and they set battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
014:011 And Asa calleth unto Jehovah his God, and saith, ‘Jehovah! it is nothing with Thee to help, between the mighty and those who have no power; help us, O Jehovah, our God, for on Thee we have leant, and in Thy name we have come against this multitude; O Jehovah, our God thou art; let him not prevail with Thee-mortal man!
014:012 And Jehovah smiteth the Cushim before Asa, and before Judah, and the Cushim flee,
014:013 and Asa and the people who are with him pursue them even to Gerar, and there fall of the Cushim, for they have no preserving, because they have been broken before Jehovah, and before His camp; and they bear away very much spoil,
014:014 and smite all the cities round about Gerar, for a fear of Jehovah hath been upon them, and they spoil all the cities, for abundant spoil hath been in them;
014:015 and also tents of cattle they have smitten, and they capture sheep in abundance, and camels, and turn back to Jerusalem.
015:001 ¶  And upon Azariah son of Oded hath been the Spirit of God,
015:002 and he goeth out before Asa, and saith to him, ‘Hear, me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; Jehovah is with you-in your being with Him, and if ye seek Him, He is found of you, and if ye forsake Him, He forsaketh you;
015:003 and many days are to Israel without a true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law,
015:004 and it turneth back in its distress unto Jehovah, God of Israel, and they seek Him, and He is found of them,
015:005 and in those times there is no peace to him who is going out, and to him who is coming in, for many troubles are on all the inhabitants of the lands,
015:006 and they have been beaten down, nation by nation, and city by city, for God hath troubled them with every adversity;
015:007 and ye, be ye strong, and let not your hands be feeble, for there is a reward for your work.’
015:008 And at Asa’s hearing these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he hath strengthened himself, and doth cause the abominations to pass away out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities that he hath captured from the hill-country of Ephraim, and reneweth the altar of Jehovah that is before the porch of Jehovah,
015:009 and gathereth all Judah and Benjamin, and the sojourners with them out of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and out of Simeon-for they have fallen unto him from Israel in abundance, in their seeing that Jehovah his God is with him.
015:010 And they are gathered to Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa,
015:011 and sacrifice to Jehovah on that day from the spoil they have brought in-oxen seven hundred, and sheep seven thousand,
015:012 and they enter into a covenant to seek Jehovah, God of their fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soul,
015:013 and every one who doth not seek for Jehovah, God of Israel, is put to death, from small unto great, from man unto woman.
015:014 And they swear to Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets,
015:015 and rejoice do all Judah concerning the oath, for with all their heart they have sworn, and with all their good-will they have sought Him, and He is found of them, and Jehovah giveth rest to them round about.
015:016 And also Maachah, mother of Asa the king-he hath removed her from being mistress, in that she hath made for a shrine a horrible thing, and Asa cutteth down her horrible thing, and beateth it small, and burneth it by the brook Kidron:
015:017 yet the high places have not turned aside from Israel; only, the heart of Asa hath been perfect all his days.
015:018 And he bringeth in the sanctified things of his father, and his own sanctified things, to the house of God, silver, and gold, and vessels.
015:019 And war hath not been till the thirty and fifth year of the reign of Asa.
016:001 ¶  In the thirty and sixth year of the reign of Asa, come up hath Baasha king of Israel, against Judah, and buildeth Ramah, so as not to permit any going out and coming in to Asa king of Judah.
016:002 And Asa bringeth out silver and gold from the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the house of the king, and sendeth unto Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who is dwelling in Damascus, saying,
016:003 ‘A covenant is between me and thee, and between my father and thy father, lo, I have sent to thee silver and gold; go, break thy covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he doth go up from off me.’
016:004 And Ben-Hadad hearkeneth unto king Asa, and sendeth the heads of the forces that he hath unto cities of Israel, and they smite Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-Maim, and all the stores, cities of Naphtali.
016:005 And it cometh to pass, at Baasha’s hearing, that he ceaseth from building Ramah, and letteth his work rest;
016:006 and Asa the king hath taken all Judah, and they bear away the stones of Ramah, and its wood, that Baasha hath built, and he buildeth with them Geba and Mizpah.
016:007 And at that time hath Hanani the seer come in unto Asa king of Judah, and saith unto him, ‘Because of thy leaning on the king of Aram, and thou hast not leaned on Jehovah thy God, therefore hath the force of the king of Aram escaped from thy hand.
016:008 Did not the Cushim and the Lubim become a very great force for multitude, for chariot, and for horsemen? and in thy leaning on Jehovah He gave them into thy hand,
016:009 for Jehovah-His eyes go to and fro in all the earth, to show Himself strong for a people whose heart is perfect towards Him; thou hast been foolish concerning this, because-henceforth there are with thee wars.’
016:010 And Asa is angry at the seer, and giveth him to the house of torture, for he is in a rage with him for this; and Asa oppresseth some of the people at that time.
016:011 And lo, the matters of Asa, the first and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
016:012 And Asa is diseased-in the thirty and ninth year of his reign-in his feet, till his disease is excessive, and also in his disease he hath not sought Jehovah, but among physicians.
016:013 And Asa lieth with his fathers, and dieth in the forty and first year of his reign,
016:014 and they bury him in one of his graves, that he had prepared for himself in the city of David, and they cause him to lie on a bed that one hath filled with spices, and divers kinds of mixtures, with perfumed work; and they burn for him a burning-very great.
017:001 ¶  And Jehoshaphat his son reigneth in his stead, and he strengtheneth himself against Israel,
017:002 and putteth a force in all the fenced cities of Judah, and putteth garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured.
017:003 And Jehovah is with Jehoshaphat, for he hath walked in the first ways of David his father, and hath not sought to Baalim,
017:004 for to the God of his father he hath sought, and in His commands he hath walked, and not according to the work of Israel.
017:005 And Jehovah doth establish the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah give a present to Jehoshaphat, and he hath riches and honour in abundance,
017:006 and his heart is high in the ways of Jehovah, and again he hath turned aside the high places and the shrines out of Judah.
017:007 And in the third year of his reign he hath sent for his heads, for Ben-Hail, and for Obadiah, and for Zechariah, and for Nethaneel, and for Michaiah, to teach in cities of Judah,
017:008 and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijath, and Tob-Adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
017:009 And they teach in Judah, and with them is the Book of the Law of Jehovah, and they go round about into all cities of Judah, and teach among the people.
017:010 And here is a fear of Jehovah on all kingdoms of the lands that are round about Judah, and they have not fought with Jehoshaphat;
017:011 and of the Philistines they are bringing in to Jehoshaphat a present, and tribute silver; also, the Arabians are bringing to him a flock, rams seven thousand an seven hundred, and he-goats seven thousand and seven hundred.
017:012 And Jehoshaphat is going on and becoming very great, and he buildeth in Judah palaces and cities of store,
017:013 and he hath much work in cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty of valour, are in Jerusalem.
017:014 And these are their numbers, for the house of their fathers: Of Judah, heads of thousands, Adnah the head, and with him mighty ones of valour, three hundred chiefs.
017:015 And at his hand is Jehohanan the head, and with him two hundred and eighty chiefs.
017:016 And at his hand is Amasiah son of Zichri, who is willingly offering himself to Jehovah, and with him two hundred chiefs, mighty of valour.
017:017 And of Benjamin: mighty of valour, Eliada, and with him, armed with bow and shield, two hundred chiefs.
017:018 And at his hand is Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty chiefs, armed ones of the host.
017:019 These are those serving the king, apart from those whom the king put in the cities of fortress, in all Judah.
018:001 ¶  And Jehoshaphat hath riches and honour in abundance, and joineth affinity to Ahab,
018:002 and goeth down at the end of certain years unto Ahab to Samaria, and Ahab sacrificeth for him sheep and oxen in abundance, and for the people who are with him, and persuadeth him to go up unto Ramoth-Gilead.
018:003 And Ahab king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, ‘Dost thou go with me to Ramoth-Gilead?’ And he saith to him, ‘As I-so thou, and as thy people-my people, even with thee in battle.’
018:004 And Jehoshaphat saith unto the king of Israel, ‘Seek, I pray thee, this day, the word of Jehovah.’
018:005 And the king of Israel gathereth the prophets, four hundred men, and saith unto them, ‘Do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?’ And they say, ‘Go up, and God doth give it into the hand of the king.’
018:006 And Jehoshaphat saith, ‘Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah still, and we seek from him?’
018:007 And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, ‘Still-one man to seek Jehovah from him, and I-I have hated him, for he is not prophesying concerning me of good, but all his days of evil, he is Micaiah son of Imlah;’ and Jehoshaphat saith, ‘Let not the king say so.’
018:008 And the king of Israel calleth unto a certain officer, and saith, ‘Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.’
018:009 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah are sitting, each on his throne, clothed with garments, and they are sitting in a threshing-floor at the opening of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets are prophesying before them.
018:010 And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah maketh for himself horns of iron, and saith, ‘Thus said Jehovah,
018:011 With these thou dost push Aram till thou hast consumed them.’ And all the prophets are prophesying so, saying, ‘Go up to Ramath-Gilead and prosper, and Jehovah hath given it into the hand of the king.’
018:012 And the messenger who hath gone to call for Micaiah hath spoken unto him, saying, ‘Lo, the words of the prophets-one mouth-are good towards the king, and let, I pray thee, thy word be like one of theirs: and thou hast spoken good.’
018:013 And Micaiah saith ‘Jehovah liveth, surely that which my God saith, it I speak.’
018:014 And he cometh in unto the king, and the king saith unto him, ‘Micaiah, do we go unto Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or do I forbear?’ And he saith, ‘Go ye up, and prosper, and they are given into your hand.’
018:015 And the king saith unto him, ‘How many times am I adjuring thee, that thou speak unto me only truth in the name of Jehovah?’
018:016 And he saith, ‘I have seen all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd, and Jehovah saith, There are no masters to these, they turn back each to his house in peace.’
018:017 And the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat, ‘Did I not say unto thee, He doth not prophesy concerning me good, but rather of evil?’
018:018 And he saith, ‘Therefore, hear ye a word of Jehovah: I have seen Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing on His right and His left;
018:019 and Jehovah saith, Who doth entice Ahab king of Israel, and he doth go up and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? And this speaker saith thus, and that speaker thus.
018:020 And go out doth the spirit, and stand before Jehovah, and saith, I do entice him; and Jehovah saith unto him, With what?
018:021 and he saith, I go out, and have become a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets. And He saith, Thou dost entice, and also, thou art able; go out and do so.
018:022 And, now, lo, Jehovah hath put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of these thy prophets, and Jehovah hath spoken concerning thee-evil.’
018:023 And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah cometh nigh, and smiteth Micaiah on the cheek, and saith, ‘Where is this-the way the Spirit of Jehovah passed over from me to speak with thee?’
018:024 And Micaiah saith, ‘Lo, thou dost see in that day, that thou dost enter into the innermost chamber to be hidden.’
018:025 And the king of Israel saith, ‘Take ye Micaiah, and turn him back unto Amon head of the city, and unto Joash son of the king,
018:026 and ye have said, Thus said the king, Put ye this one in the house of restraint, and cause him to eat bread of oppression, and water of oppression, till my return in peace.’
018:027 And Micaiah saith, ‘If thou dost certainly return in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me;’ and he saith, ‘Hear ye, O peoples, all of them!’
018:028 And the king of Israel goeth up, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, unto Ramoth-Gilead;
018:029 and the king of Israel saith unto Jehoshaphat to disguise himself, and to go into battle, ‘And thou, put on thy garments.’ And the king of Israel disguiseth himself, and they go into battle.
018:030 And the king of Aram hath commanded the heads of the charioteers whom he hath, saying, ‘Ye do not fight with small or with great, except with the king of Israel by himself.’
018:031 And it cometh to pass at the heads of the charioteers seeing Jehoshaphat, that they have said, ‘The king of Israel he is,’ and they turn round against him to fight, and Jehoshaphat crieth out, and Jehovah hath helped him, and God enticeth them from him,
018:032 yea, it cometh to pass, at the heads of the charioteers seeing that it hath not been the king of Israel-they turn back from after him.
018:033 And a man hath drawn with a bow, in his simplicity, and smiteth the king of Israel between the joinings and the coat of mail, and he saith to the charioteer, ‘Turn thy hand, and thou hast brought me out of the camp, for I have become sick.’
018:034 And the battle increaseth on that day, and the king of Israel hath been stayed up in the chariot over-against Aram till the evening, and he dieth at the time of the going in of the sun.
019:001 ¶  And Jehoshaphat king of Judah turneth back unto his house in peace to Jerusalem,
019:002 and go out unto his presence doth Jehu son of Hanani, the seer, and saith unto king Jehoshaphat, ‘To give help to the wicked, and to those hating Jehovah, dost thou love? and for this against thee is wrath from before Jehovah,
019:003 but good things have been found with thee, for thou hast put away the shrines out of the land, and hast prepared thy heart to seek God.’
019:004 And Jehoshaphat dwelleth in Jerusalem, and he turneth back and goeth out among the people from Beer-Sheba unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and bringeth them back unto Jehovah, God of their fathers.
019:005 And he establisheth judges in the land, in all the fenced cities of Judah, for every city,
019:006 and saith unto the judges, ‘See what ye are doing-for not for man do ye judge, but for Jehovah, who is with you in the matter of judgment;
019:007 and now, let fear of Jehovah be upon you, observe and do, for there is not with Jehovah our God perverseness, and acceptance of faces, and taking of a bribe.’
019:008 And also in Jerusalem hath Jehoshaphat appointed of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the heads of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for strife; and they turn back to Jerusalem,
019:009 and he layeth a charge upon them, saying, ‘Thus do ye do in the fear of Jehovah, in faithfulness, and with a perfect heart,
019:010 and any strife that cometh in unto you of your brethren who are dwelling in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and command, statutes, and judgments, then ye have warned them and they become not guilty before Jehovah, and wrath hath not been on you and on your brethren; thus do ye do, and ye are not guilty.
019:011 ‘And, lo, Amariah the head priest is over you for every matter of Jehovah, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the house of Judah, is for every matter of the king, and officers the Levites are before you; be strong and do, and Jehovah is with the good.’
020:001 ¶  And it cometh to pass after this, the sons of Moab have come in, and the sons of Ammon, and with them of the peoples, against Jehoshaphat to battle.
020:002 And they come in and declare to Jehoshaphat, saying, ‘Come against thee hath a great multitude from beyond the sea, from Aram, and lo, they are in Hazezon-Tamar-it is En-Gedi.’
020:003 And Jehoshaphat feareth, and setteth his face to seek to Jehovah, and proclaimeth a fast over all Judah;
020:004 and Judah is gathered to inquire of Jehovah; also, from all the cities of Judah they have come in to seek Jehovah.
020:005 And Jehoshaphat standeth in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, at the front of the new court,
020:006 and saith, ‘O Jehovah, God of our fathers, art not Thou-God in the heavens? yea, Thou art ruling over all kingdoms of the nations, and in Thy hand is power and might, and there is none with Thee to station himself.
020:007 ‘Art not Thou our God? Thou hast dispossessed the inhabitants of this land from before Thy people Israel, and dost give it to the seed of Abraham Thy friend to the age,
020:008 and they dwell in it, and build to Thee in it a sanctuary for Thy name, saying,
020:009 If evil doth come upon us-sword, judgment, and pestilence, and famine-we stand before this house, and before Thee, for Thy name is in this house, and cry unto Thee out of our distress, and Thou dost hear and save.
020:010 ‘And now, lo, sons of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, whom Thou didst not grant to Israel to go in against in their coming out of the land of Egypt, for they turned aside from off them and destroyed them not,
020:011 and lo, they are recompensing to us-to come in to drive us out of Thy possession, that Thou hast caused us to possess.
020:012 ‘O our God, dost Thou not execute judgment upon them? for there is no power in us before this great multitude that hath come against us, and we know not what we do, but on Thee are our eyes.’
020:013 And all Judah are standing before Jehovah, also their infants, their wives, and their sons.
020:014 And upon Jahaziel, son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, hath the Spirit of Jehovah been, in the midst of the assembly,
020:015 and he saith, ‘Attend, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and O king Jehoshaphat, Thus said Jehovah to you, Ye fear not, nor are afraid of the face of this great multitude, for not for you is the battle, but for God.
020:016 To-morrow, go ye down against them, lo, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz, and ye have found them in the end of the valley, the front of the wilderness of Jeruel.
020:017 Not for you to fight in this; station yourselves, stand, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem-be not afraid nor fear ye-to-morrow go out before them, and Jehovah is with you.’
020:018 And Jehoshaphat boweth-face to the earth-and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have fallen before Jehovah, to bow themselves to Jehovah.
020:019 And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohathites, and of the sons of the Korhites, rise to give praise to Jehovah, God of Israel, with a loud voice on high.
020:020 And they rise early in the morning, and go out to the wilderness of Tekoa, and in their going out Jehoshaphat hath stood and saith, ‘Hear me, O Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, remain stedfast in Jehovah your God, and be stedfast; remain stedfast in His prophets, and prosper.’
020:021 And he taketh counsel with the people, and appointeth singers to Jehovah, and those giving praise to the honour of holiness, in the going out before the armed men, and saying, ‘Give ye thanks to Jehovah, for to the age is His kindness.’
020:022 And at the time they have begun with singing and praise, Jehovah hath put ambushments against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who are coming in to Judah, and they are smitten,
020:023 and the sons of Ammon stand up, and Moab, against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to devote and to destroy, and at their finishing with the inhabitants of Seir, they helped, a man against his neighbour, to destroy.
020:024 And Judah hath come in unto the watch-tower, to the wilderness, and they look unto the multitude, and lo, they are carcases fallen to the earth, and there is none escaped,
020:025 and Jehoshaphat cometh in, and his people, to seize their spoil, and they find among them, in abundance, both goods and carcases, and desirable vessels, and they take spoil to themselves without prohibition, and they are three days seizing the spoil, for it is abundant.
020:026 And on the fourth day they have been assembled at the valley of Blessing, for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore they have called the name of that place, ‘Valley of Blessing,’ unto this day.
020:027 And they turn back, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, to go back unto Jerusalem with joy, for Jehovah hath made them rejoice over their enemies.
020:028 And they come in to Jerusalem with psalteries, and with harps, and with trumpets, unto the house of Jehovah.
020:029 And there is a fear of God on all kingdoms of the lands in their hearing that Jehovah hath fought with the enemies of Israel,
020:030 and the kingdom of Jehoshaphat is quiet, and his God giveth rest to him round about.
020:031 And Jehoshaphat reigneth over Judah, a son of thirty and five years in his reigning, and twenty and five years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
020:032 And he walketh in the way of his father Asa, and hath not turned aside from it, to do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
020:033 Only, the high places have not turned aside, and still the people have not prepared their heart for the God of their fathers.
020:034 And the rest of the matters of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, lo, they are written among the matters of Jehu son of Hanani, who hath been mentioned on the book of the kings of Israel.
020:035 And after this hath Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, (he did wickedly in so doing),
020:036 and he joineth him with himself to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they make ships in Ezion-Geber,
020:037 and prophesy doth Eliezer son of Dodavah, of Mareshah, against Jehoshaphat, saying, ‘For thy joining thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah hath broken up thy works;’ and the ships are broken, and have not retained power to go unto Tarshish.
021:001 ¶  And Jehoshaphat lieth with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son reigneth in his stead.
021:002 And he hath brethren, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these are sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel,
021:003 and their father giveth to them many gifts of silver and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah, and the kingdom he hath given to Jehoram, for He is the first-born.
021:004 And Jehoram riseth up over the kingdom of his father, and strengtheneth himself, and slayeth all his brethren with the sword, and also-of the heads of Israel.
021:005 A son of thirty and two years is Jehoram in his reigning, and eight years he hath reigned in Jerusalem,
021:006 and he walketh in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for a daughter of Ahab hath been to him for a wife, and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah,
021:007 and Jehovah hath not been willing to destroy the house of David, for the sake of the covenant that He made with David, and as He had said to give to him a lamp, and to his sons-all the days.
021:008 In his days hath Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and cause a king to reign over them;
021:009 and Jehoram passeth over with his heads, and all the chariots with him, and it cometh to pass, he hath risen by night and smiteth the Edomites who are coming round against him, and the princes of the chariots,
021:010 and Edom revolteth from under the hand of Judah unto this day; then doth Libnah revolt at that time from under his hand, because he hath forsaken Jehovah, God of his fathers,
021:011 also, he hath made high places in the mountains of Judah, and causeth the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit whoredom, and compelleth Judah.
021:012 And there cometh in unto him a writing from Elijah the prophet, saying, ‘Thus said Jehovah, God of David thy father, Because that thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, and in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
021:013 and thou dost walk in the way of the kings of Israel, and dost cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit whoredom like the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also thy brethren, the house of thy father, who are better than thyself, thou hast slain;
021:014 lo, Jehovah is smiting-a great smiting-among thy people, and among thy sons, and among thy wives, and among all thy goods-
021:015 and thou, with many sicknesses, with disease of thy bowels, till thy bowels come out, by the sickness, day by day.’
021:016 And Jehovah waketh up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, who are beside the Cushim,
021:017 and they come up into Judah, and rend it, and take captive all the substance that is found at the house of the king, and also his sons, and his wives, and there hath not been left to him a son except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.
021:018 And after all this hath Jehovah plagued him in his bowels by a disease for which there is no healing,
021:019 and it cometh to pass, from days to days, and at the time of the going out of the end of two years, his bowels have gone out with his sickness, and he dieth of sore diseases, and his people have not made for him a burning like the burning of his fathers.
021:020 A son of thirty and two years was he in his reigning, and eight years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he goeth without desire, and they bury him in the city of David, and not in the graves of the kings.
022:001 ¶  And the inhabitants of Jerusalem cause Ahaziah his youngest son to reign in his stead, (for all the elder had the troop slain that came in with the Arabians to the camp,) and Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah reigneth.
022:002 A son of twenty and two years is Ahaziah in his reigning, and one year he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Athaliah daughter of Omri;
022:003 he also hath walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother hath been his counsellor to do wickedly.
022:004 And he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab, for they have been his counsellors, after the death of his father, for destruction to him.
022:005 Also, in their counsel he hath walked, and goeth with Jehoram son of Ahab king of Israel to battle against Hazael king of Aram, in Ramoth-Gilead, and they of Ramah smite Joram;
022:006 and he turneth back to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds with which they had smitten him in Ramah, in his fighting with Hazael king of Aram. And Azariah son of Jehoram king of Judah hath gone down to see Jehoram son of Ahab, in Jezreel, for he is sick;
022:007 and from God hath been the destruction of Ahaziah, to come unto Joram: and in his coming he hath gone out with Jehoram unto Jehu son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
022:008 And it cometh to pass, in Jehu’s executing judgment with the house of Ahab, that he findeth the heads of Judah and sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministers of Ahaziah, and slayeth them.
022:009 And he seeketh Ahaziah, and they capture him, (and he is hiding himself in Samaria), and bring him in unto Jehu, and put him to death, and bury him, for they said, ‘He is son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart;’ and there is none to the house of Ahaziah to retain power for the kingdom.
022:010 And Athaliah mother of Ahaziah hath seen that her son is dead, and she riseth and destroyeth the whole seed of the kingdom of the house of Judah.
022:011 And Jehoshabeath daughter of the king taketh Joash son of Ahaziah, and stealeth him from the midst of the sons of the king who are put to death, and putteth him and his nurse into the inner part of the bed-chambers, and Jehoshabeath daughter of king Jehoram, wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she hath been sister of Ahaziah, hideth him from the face of Athaliah, and she hath not put him to death.
022:012 And he is with them in the house of God hiding himself six years, and Athaliah is reigning over the land.
023:001 ¶  And in the seventh year hath Jehoiada strengthened himself, and taketh the heads of the hundreds, even Azariah son of Jeroham, and Ishmael son of Jehohanan, and Azariah son of Obed, and Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zichri, with him into covenant.
023:002 And they go round about in Judah, and gather the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and heads of the fathers of Israel, and come in unto Jerusalem,
023:003 and all the assembly make a covenant in the house of God with the king, and he saith to them, ‘Lo, the son of the king doth reign, as Jehovah spake concerning the sons of David.
023:004 ‘This is the thing that ye do: The third of you, going in on the sabbath, of the priests, and of the Levites, are for gatekeepers of the thresholds,
023:005 and the third are at the house of the king, and the third at the gate of the foundation, and all the people are in the courts of the house of Jehovah.
023:006 ‘And none doth enter the house of Jehovah except the priests, and those ministering of the Levites (they go in for they are holy), and all the people keep the watch of Jehovah:
023:007 and the Levites have compassed the king round about, each with his weapon in his hand, and he who hath gone in unto the house is put to death; and be ye with the king in his coming in and in his going out.’
023:008 And the Levites and all Judah do according to all that Jehoiada the priest hath commanded, and take each his men going in on the sabbath, with those going out on the sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest hath not let away the courses.
023:009 And Jehoiada the priest giveth to the heads of the hundreds the spears, and the shields, and the bucklers that are king David’s, that are in the house of God;
023:010 and he stationeth the whole of the people, and each his dart in his hand, from the right shoulder of the house unto the left shoulder of the house, at the altar, and at the house, by the king, round about.
023:011 And they bring out the son of the king, and put upon him the crown, and the testimony, and cause him to reign; and Jehoiada and his sons anoint him, and say, ‘Let the king live!’
023:012 And Athaliah heareth the voice of the people who are running, and who are praising the king, and she cometh in unto the people in the house of Jehovah,
023:013 and seeth, and lo, the king is standing by his pillar in the entrance, and the heads, and the trumpets are by the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and shouting with trumpets, and the singers with instruments of song, and the teachers, to praise, and Athaliah rendeth her garments, and saith, ‘Conspiracy, conspiracy.’
023:014 And Jehoiada the priest bringeth out the heads of the hundreds, inspectors of the force, and saith unto them, ‘Take her out from within the rows, and he who hath gone after her is put to death by the sword;’ for the priest said, ‘Put her not to death in the house of Jehovah.’
023:015 And they make for her sides, and she cometh in unto the entrance of the gate of the horses at the house of the king, and they put her to death there.
023:016 And Jehoiada maketh a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, to be for a people to Jehovah;
023:017 and all the people enter the house of Baal, and break it down, yea, his altars and his images they have broken, and Mattan priest of Baal they have slain before the altars.
023:018 And Jehoiada putteth the offices of the house of Jehovah into the hand of the priests the Levites whom David had apportioned over the house of Jehovah, to cause to ascend the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as written in the law of Moses, with joy, and with singing, by the hands of David;
023:019 and he stationeth the gatekeepers over the gates of the house of Jehovah, and the unclean in anything doth not go in.
023:020 And he taketh the heads of the hundreds, and the honourable ones, and the rulers among the people, and all the people of the land, and bringeth down the king from the house of Jehovah, and they come in through the high gate to the house of the king, and cause the king to sit on the throne of the kingdom.
023:021 And all the people of the land rejoice, and the city hath been quiet, and Athaliah they have put to death by the sword.
024:001 ¶  A son of seven years is Joash in his reigning, and forty years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Zibiah of Beer-Sheba.
024:002 And Joash doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
024:003 And Jehoiada taketh for him two wives, and he begetteth sons and daughters.
024:004 And it cometh to pass after this, it hath been with the heart of Joash to renew the house of Jehovah,
024:005 and he gathereth the priests and the Levites, and saith to them, ‘Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to strengthen the house of your God sufficiently year by year, and ye, ye do haste to the matter;’ and the Levites have not hasted.
024:006 And the king calleth for Jehoiada the head, and saith to him, ‘Wherefore hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tribute of Moses, servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?
024:007 for sons of Athaliah, the wicked one, have broken up the house of God, and also, all the holy things of the house of Jehovah they have prepared for Baalim.’
024:008 And the king speaketh, and they make one chest, and put it at the gate of the house of Jehovah without,
024:009 and give an intimation in Judah and in Jerusalem to bring in to Jehovah the tribute of Moses, servant of God, laid on Israel in the wilderness.
024:010 And all the heads, and all the people rejoice, and they bring in, and cast into the chest, unto completion.
024:011 And it cometh to pass, at the time one bringeth in the chest for the inspection of the king by the hand of the Levites, and at their seeing that the money is abundant, that a scribe of the king hath come in, and an officer of the head-priest, and they empty the chest, and take it up and turn it back unto its place; thus they have done day by day, and gather money in abundance.
024:012 And the king and Jehoiada give it unto the doers of the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and they are hiring hewers and artificers to renew the house of Jehovah, and also-to artificers in iron and brass to strengthen the house of Jehovah.
024:013 And those doing the business work, and there goeth up lengthening to the work by their hand, and they establish the house of God, by its proper measure, and strengthen it.
024:014 And at their completing it, they have brought in before the king and Jehoiada the rest of the money, and they make it vessels for the house of Jehovah, vessels of serving, and of offering up, and spoons, even vessels of gold and silver; and they are causing burnt-offerings to ascend in the house of Jehovah continually, all the days of Jehoiada.
024:015 And Jehoiada is aged and satisfied with days, and dieth-a son of a hundred and thirty years in his death,
024:016 and they bury him in the city of David, with the kings, for he hath done good in Israel, and with God, and his house.
024:017 And after the death of Jehoiada come in have heads of Judah, and bow themselves to the king; then hath the king hearkened unto them,
024:018 and they forsake the house of Jehovah, God of their fathers, and serve the shrines and the idols, and there is wrath upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt.
024:019 And He sendeth among them prophets, to bring them back unto Jehovah, and they testify against them, and they have not given ear;
024:020 and the Spirit of God hath clothed Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, and he standeth over-against the people, and saith to them, ‘Thus said God, Why are ye transgressing the commands of Jehovah, and prosper not? because ye have forsaken Jehovah-He doth forsake you.’
024:021 And they conspire against him, and stone him with stones by the command of the king, in the court of the house of Jehovah,
024:022 and Joash the king hath not remembered the kindness that Jehoiada his father did with him, and slayeth his son, and in his death he said, ‘Jehovah doth see, and require.’
024:023 And it cometh to pass, at the turn of the year, come up hath the force of Aram against him, and they come in unto Judah and Jerusalem, and destroy all the heads of the people from the people, and all their spoil they have sent to the king of Damascus,
024:024 for with few men have the force of Aram come in, and Jehovah hath given into their hand a mighty force for multitude, because they have forsaken Jehovah, God of their fathers; and with Joash they have executed judgments.
024:025 And in their going from him-for they left him with many diseases-his servants themselves have conspired against him, for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slay him on his bed, and he dieth; and they bury him in the city of David, and have not buried him in the graves of the kings.
024:026 And these are those conspiring against him, Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
024:027 As to his sons, and the greatness of the burden upon him, and the foundation of the house of God, lo, they are written on the ‘Inquiry’ of the book of the Kings; and reign doth Amaziah his son in his stead.
025:001 ¶  A son of twenty and five years hath Amaziah reigned, and twenty and nine years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Jehoaddan of Jerusalem,
025:002 and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah-only, not with a perfect heart.
025:003 And it cometh to pass, when the kingdom hath been strong upon him, that he slayeth his servants, those smiting the king his father,
025:004 and their sons he hath not put to death, but did as is written in the law, in the book of Moses, whom Jehovah commanded, saying, ‘Fathers do not die for sons, and sons die not for fathers, but each for his own sin they die.’
025:005 And Amaziah gathereth Judah, and appointeth them, according to the house of the fathers, for heads of the thousands, and for heads of the hundreds, for all Judah and Benjamin; and he inspecteth them from a son of twenty years and upward, and findeth them three hundred thousand chosen ones, going forth to the host, holding spear and target.
025:006 And he hireth out of Israel a hundred thousand mighty ones of valour, with a hundred talents of silver;
025:007 and a man of God hath come in unto him, saying, ‘O king, the host of Israel doth not go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel-all the sons of Ephraim;
025:008 but if thou art going-do it, be strong for battle, God doth cause thee to stumble before an enemy, for there is power in God to help, and to cause to stumble.’
025:009 And Amaziah saith to the man of God, ‘And what-to do for the hundred talents that I have given to the troop of Israel?’ And the man of God saith, ‘Jehovah hath more to give to thee than this.’
025:010 And Amaziah separateth them-for the troop that hath come in unto him from Ephraim to go to their own place, and their anger doth burn mightily against Judah, and they turn back to their place in the heat of anger.
025:011 And Amaziah hath strengthened himself, and leadeth his people, and goeth to the Valley of Salt, and smiteth the sons of Seir-ten thousand.
025:012 And ten thousand alive have the sons of Judah taken captive, and they bring them to the top of the rock, and cast them from the top of the rock, and all of them have been broken.
025:013 And the sons of the troop that Amaziah hath sent back from going with him to battle-they rush against cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-Horon, and smite of them three thousand, and seize much prey.
025:014 And it cometh to pass, after the coming in of Amaziah from smiting the Edomites, that he bringeth in the gods of the sons of Seir, and establisheth them to him for gods, and before them doth bow himself, and to them he maketh perfume.
025:015 And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Amaziah, and He sendeth unto him a prophet, and he saith unto him, ‘Why hast thou sought the gods of the people that have not delivered their people out of thy hand?’
025:016 And it cometh to pass, in his speaking unto him, that he saith to him, ‘For a counsellor to the king have we appointed thee? cease for thee; why do they smite thee?’ And the prophet ceaseth, and saith, ‘I have known that God hath counselled to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.’
025:017 And Amaziah king of Judah taketh counsel, and sendeth unto Joash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,
025:018 ‘Come, we look one another in the face.’ And Joash king of Israel sendeth unto Amaziah king of Judah, saying, ‘The thorn that is in Lebanon hath sent unto the cedar that is in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for a wife; and pass by doth a beast of the field that is in Lebanon, and treadeth down the thorn.
025:019 Thou hast said, Lo, I have smitten Edom; and thy heart hath lifted thee up to boast; now, abide in thy house, why dost thou stir thyself up in evil, that thou hast fallen, thou, and Judah with thee?’
025:020 And Amaziah hath not hearkened, for from God it is in order to give them into hand, because they have sought the gods of Edom;
025:021 and go up doth Joash king of Israel, and they look one another in the face, he and Amaziah king of Judah, in Beth-Shemesh, that is Judah’s,
025:022 and Judah is smitten before Israel, and they flee-each to his tents.
025:023 And Amaziah king of Judah, son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, hath Joash king of Israel caught in Beth-Shemesh, and bringeth him in to Jerusalem, and breaketh down in the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits,
025:024 and taketh all the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that are found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the house of the king, and the sons of the pledges, and turneth back to Samaria.
025:025 And Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, liveth after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, fifteen years;
025:026 and the rest of the matters of Amaziah, the first and the last, lo, are they not written on the books of the kings of Judah and Israel?
025:027 And from the time that Amaziah hath turned aside from after Jehovah-they make a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fleeth to Lachish, and they send after him to Lachish, and put him to death there,
025:028 and lift him up on the horses, and bury him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
026:001 ¶  And all the people of Judah take Uzziah (and he is a son of sixteen years), and cause him to reign instead of his father Amaziah.
026:002 He hath built Eloth, and restoreth it to Judah after the king’s lying with his fathers.
026:003 A son of sixteen years is Uzziah in his reigning, and fifty and two years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
026:004 And he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Amaziah his father did,
026:005 and he is as one seeking God in the days of Zechariah who hath understanding in visions of God: and in the days of his seeking Jehovah, God hath caused him to prosper.
026:006 And he goeth forth, and fighteth with the Philistines, and breaketh down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and buildeth cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
026:007 And God helpeth him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who are dwelling in Gur-Baal and the Mehunim.
026:008 And the Ammonites give a present to Uzziah, and his name goeth unto the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthened himself greatly.
026:009 And Uzziah buildeth towers in Jerusalem, by the gate of the corner, and by the gate of the valley, and by the angle, and strengtheneth them;
026:010 and he buildeth towers in the wilderness, and diggeth many wells, for he had much cattle, both in the low country and in the plain, husbandmen and vine-dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel; for he was a lover of the ground.
026:011 And Uzziah hath a force, making war, going forth to the host, by troops, in the number of their reckoning by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Masseiah the officer, by the hand of Hananiah one of the heads of the king.
026:012 The whole number of heads of the fathers of the mighty ones of valour is two thousand and six hundred;
026:013 and by their hand is the force of the host, three hundred thousand, and seven thousand, and five hundred warriors, with mighty power to give help to the king against the enemy.
026:014 And Uzziah prepareth for them, for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, even to stones of the slings.
026:015 And he maketh in Jerusalem inventions-a device of an inventor-to be on the towers, and on the corners, to shoot with arrows and with great stones, and his name goeth out unto a distance, for he hath been wonderfully helped till that he hath been strong.
026:016 And at his being strong his heart hath been high unto destruction, and he trespasseth against Jehovah his God, and goeth in unto the temple of Jehovah to make perfume upon the altar of perfume.
026:017 And Azariah the priest goeth in after him, and with him priests of Jehovah eighty, sons of valour,
026:018 and they stand up against Uzziah the king, and say to him, ‘Not for thee, O Uzziah, to make perfume to Jehovah, but for priests, sons of Aaron, who are sanctified to make perfume; go forth from the sanctuary, for thou hast trespassed, and it is not to thee for honour from Jehovah God.’
026:019 And Uzziah is wroth, and in his hand is a censer to make perfume, and in his being wroth with the priests-the leprosy hath risen in his forehead, before the priests, in the house of Jehovah, from beside the altar of perfume.
026:020 And Azariah the head priest looketh unto him, and all the priests, and lo, he is leprous in his forehead, and they hasten him thence, and also he himself hath hastened to go out, for Jehovah hath plagued him.
026:021 And Uzziah the king is a leper unto the day of his death, and inhabiteth a separate house-a leper, for he hath been cut off from the house of Jehovah, and Jotham his son is over the house of the king, judging the people of the land.
026:022 And the rest of the matters of Uzziah, the first and the last, hath Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet written;
026:023 and Uzziah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him with his fathers, in the field of the burying-place that the kings have, for they said, ‘He is a leper;’ and reign doth Jotham his son in his stead.
027:001 ¶  A son of twenty and five years is Jotham in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
027:002 And he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Uzziah his father did; only, he hath not come in unto the temple of Jehovah; and again are the people doing corruptly.
027:003 He hath built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and in the wall of Ophel he hath built abundantly;
027:004 and cities he hath built in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he hath built palaces and towers.
027:005 And he hath fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevaileth over them, and the sons of Ammon give to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and of barley ten thousand; this have the sons of Ammon returned to him both in the second year, and in the third.
027:006 And Jotham doth strengthen himself, for he hath prepared his ways before Jehovah his God.
027:007 And the rest of the matters of Jotham, and all his battles, and his ways, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
027:008 A son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;
027:009 and Jotham lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign doth Ahaz his son in his stead.
028:001 ¶  A son of twenty years is Ahaz in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he hath not done that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, as David his father,
028:002 and walketh in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also, molten images hath made for Baalim,
028:003 and himself hath made perfume in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burneth his sons with fire according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,
028:004 and sacrificeth and maketh perfume in high places, and on the heights, and under every green tree.
028:005 And Jehovah his God giveth him into the hand of the king of Aram, and they smite him, and take captive from him a great captivity, and bring them in to Damascus, and also into the hand of the king of Israel he hath been given, and he smiteth him-a great smiting.
028:006 And Pekah son of Remaliah slayeth in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day (the whole are sons of valour), because of their forsaking Jehovah, God of their fathers.
028:007 And Zichri, a mighty one of Ephraim, slayeth Maaseiah son of the king, and Azrikam leader of the house, and Elkanah second to the king.
028:008 And the sons of Israel take captive of their brethren, two hundred thousand, wives, sons and daughters, and also much spoil they have seized from them, and they bring in the spoil to Samaria.
028:009 And there hath been there a prophet of Jehovah (Oded is his name), and he goeth out before the host that hath come in to Samaria, and saith to them, ‘Lo, in the fury of Jehovah God of your fathers against Judah, He hath given them into your hand, and ye slay among them in rage-unto the heavens it hath come;
028:010 and now, sons of Judah and Jerusalem ye are saying to subdue for men-servants and for maid-servants to you; but are there not with you causes of guilt before Jehovah your God?
028:011 and now, hear me, and send back the captives whom ye have taken captive of your brethren, for the heat of the anger of Jehovah is upon you.’
028:012 And certain of the heads of the sons of Ephraim (Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai), rise up against those coming in from the host,
028:013 and say to them, ‘Ye do not bring in the captives hither, for, to guilt against Jehovah on us, ye are saying to add unto our sin and unto our guilt? for abundant is the guilt we have, and the fierceness of anger on Israel.’
028:014 And the armed men leave the captives and the prey before the heads and all the assembly;
028:015 and the men who have been expressed by name rise and take hold on the captives, and all their naked ones they have clothed from the spoil, yea, they clothe them, and shoe them, and cause them to eat and drink, and anoint them, and lead them on asses, even every feeble one, and bring them in to Jericho, the city of palms, near their brethren, and turn back to Samaria.
028:016 At that time hath king Ahaz sent unto the king of Asshur to give help to him;
028:017 and again the Edomites have come, and smite in Judah, and take captive a captivity.
028:018 And the Philistines have rushed against the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and capture Beth-Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho and its villages, and Timnah and its villages, and Gimzo and its villages, and dwell there,
028:019 for Jehovah hath humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he made free with Judah, even to commit a trespass against Jehovah.
028:020 And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Asshur cometh in unto him, and doth distress him, and hath not strengthened him,
028:021 though Ahaz hath taken a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and giveth to the king of Asshur, yet it is no help to him.
028:022 And in the time of his distress-he addeth to trespass against Jehovah, (this king Ahaz),
028:023 and he sacrificeth to the gods of Damascus-those smiting him, and saith, ‘Because the gods of the kings of Aram are helping them, to them I sacrifice, and they help me,’ and they have been to him to cause him to stumble, and to all Israel.
028:024 And Ahaz gathereth the vessels of the house of God, and cutteth in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shutteth the doors of the house of Jehovah, and maketh to himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem.
028:025 And in every city and city of Judah he hath made high places to make perfume to other gods, and provoketh Jehovah, God of his fathers.
028:026 And the rest of his matters, and all his ways, the first and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
028:027 And Ahaz lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city, in Jerusalem, but have not brought him in to the graves of the kings of Israel, and reign doth Hezekiah his son in his stead.
029:001 ¶  Hezekiah hath reigned-a son of twenty and five years, and twenty and nine years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother is Abijah daughter of Zechariah;
029:002 and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father did.
029:003 He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, hath opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and strengtheneth them,
029:004 and bringeth in the priests and the Levites, and gathereth them to the broad place to the east.
029:005 And he saith to them, ‘Hear me, O Levites, now, sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, God of your fathers, and bring out the impurity from the sanctuary,
029:006 for our fathers have trespassed, and done that which is evil in the eyes of Jehovah our God, and forsake him, and turn round their faces from the tabernacle of Jehovah, and give the neck.
029:007 ‘Also-they have shut the doors of the porch, and quench the lamps, and perfume they have not made, and burnt-offering have not caused to ascend in the sanctuary to the God of Israel,
029:008 and the wrath of Jehovah is on Judah and Jerusalem, and He giveth them for a trembling, for an astonishment, and for a hissing, as ye are seeing with your eyes.
029:009 And lo, fallen have our fathers by the sword, and our sons, and our daughters, and our wives are in captivity for this.
029:010 ‘Now-with my heart-to make a covenant before Jehovah, God of Israel, and the fierceness of His anger doth turn back from us.
029:011 My sons, be not now at rest, for on you hath Jehovah fixed to stand before Him, to serve Him, and to be to Him ministering and making perfume.’
029:012 And the Levites rise-Mahath son of Amasai, and Joel son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathite; and of the sons of Merari: Kish son of Abdi, and Azariah son of Jehalelel; and of the Gershonite: Joah son of Zimmah, and Eden son of Joah;
029:013 and of the sons of Elizaphan: Shimri, and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah;
029:014 and of the sons of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel-
029:015 and they gather their brethren, and sanctify themselves, and come in, according to the command of the king in the matters of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah,
029:016 and the priests come in to the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and bring out all the uncleanness that they have found in the temple of Jehovah to the court of the house of Jehovah, and the Levites receive it, to take it out to the brook Kidron without.
029:017 And they begin on the first of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they have come to the porch of Jehovah, and they sanctify the house of Jehovah in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they have finished.
029:018 And they come in within unto Hezekiah the king, and say, ‘We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and the table of the arrangement, and all its vessels,
029:019 and all the vessels that king Ahaz cast away in his reign-in his trespass-we have prepared and sanctified, and lo, they are before the altar of Jehovah.’
029:020 And Hezekiah the king riseth early, and gathereth the heads of the city, and goeth up to the house of Jehovah;
029:021 and they bring in seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven young he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah; and he saith to sons of Aaron, the priests, to cause them to ascend on the altar of Jehovah.
029:022 And they slaughter the oxen, and the priests receive the blood, and sprinkle on the altar; and they slaughter the rams, and sprinkle the blood on the altar; and they slaughter the lambs, and sprinkle the blood on the altar;
029:023 and they bring nigh the he-goats of the sin-offering before the king and the assembly, and they lay their hands upon them;
029:024 and the priests slaughter them, and make a sin-offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel, for ‘For all Israel,’ said the king, ‘is the burnt-offering and the sin-offering.’
029:025 And he appointeth the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, by the command of David, and of Gad, seer of the king, and of Nathan the prophet, for by the hand of Jehovah is the command, by the hand of His prophets;
029:026 and the Levites stand with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
029:027 And Hezekiah saith to cause the burnt-offering to ascend on the altar; and at the time the burnt-offering began-began the song of Jehovah, and the trumpets, even by the hands of the instruments of David king of Israel.
029:028 And all the assembly are doing obeisance, and the singers singing, and the trumpeters blowing; the whole is till the completion of the burnt-offering.
029:029 And at the completion of the offering up bowed have the king and all those found with him, and do obeisance.
029:030 And Hezekiah the king saith, and the princes, to the Levites to give praise to Jehovah in the words of David, and of Asaph the seer, and they praise-unto joy, and they bow, and do obeisance.
029:031 And Hezekiah answereth and saith, ‘Now ye have filled your hand to Jehovah, come nigh, and bring in sacrifices and thank-offerings to the house of Jehovah;’ and the assembly bring in sacrifices and thank-offerings, and every willing-hearted one-burnt-offerings.
029:032 And the number of the burnt-offerings that the assembly have brought in, is seventy oxen, a hundred rams, lambs two hundred; for a burnt-offering to Jehovah are all these.
029:033 And the sanctified things are oxen six hundred, and sheep three thousand.
029:034 Only, the priests have become few, and have not been able to strip the whole of the burnt-offerings, and their brethren the Levites strengthen them till the completion of the work, and till the priests sanctify themselves, for the Levites are more upright of heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
029:035 And also, burnt-offerings are in abundance, with fat of the peace-offerings, and with oblations for the burnt-offering; and the service of the house of Jehovah is established,
029:036 and rejoice doth Hezekiah and all the people, because of God’s giving preparation to the people, for the thing hath been suddenly.
030:001 ¶  And Hezekiah sendeth unto all Israel and Judah, and also letters he hath written unto Ephraim and Manasseh, to come in to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, to make a passover to Jehovah, God of Israel.
030:002 And the king taketh counsel, and his heads, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to make the passover in the second month,
030:003 for they have not been able to make it at that time, for the priests have not sanctified themselves sufficiently, and the people have not been gathered to Jerusalem.
030:004 And the thing is right in the eyes of the king, and in the eyes of all the assembly,
030:005 and they establish the thing, to cause to pass over an intimation into all Israel, from Beer-Sheba even unto Dan, to come in to make a passover to Jehovah, God of Israel, in Jerusalem, for not for a long time had they done as it is written.
030:006 And the runners go with letters from the hand of the king and his heads, into all Israel and Judah, even according to the command of the king, saying, ‘O sons of Israel, turn back unto Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He doth turn back unto the escaped part that is left of you from the hand of the kings of Asshur;
030:007 and do not be like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, God of their fathers, and He giveth them to desolation, as ye do see.
030:008 ‘Now, harden not your neck like your fathers, give a hand to Jehovah, and come in to His sanctuary, that He hath sanctified to the age, and serve Jehovah your God, and the fierceness of His anger doth turn back from you;
030:009 for in your turning back unto Jehovah, your brethren and your sons have mercies before their captors, even to return to this land, for gracious and merciful is Jehovah your God, and He doth not turn aside the face from you, if ye turn back unto Him.’
030:010 And the runners are passing over from city to city, in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: and they are laughing at them, and mocking at them,
030:011 only, certain from Asher, and Manasseh, and from Zebulun, have been humbled, and come in to Jerusalem.
030:012 Also, in Judah hath the hand of God been to give to them one heart to do the command of the king and of the heads, in the matter of Jehovah;
030:013 and much people are gathered to Jerusalem, to make the feast of unleavened things in the second month-a mighty assembly for multitude.
030:014 And they arise and turn aside the altars that are in Jerusalem, and all the perfume altars they have turned aside, and cast them to the brook Kidron;
030:015 and they slaughter the passover-offering on the fourteenth of the second month, and the priests and the Levites have been ashamed, and sanctify themselves, and bring in burnt-offerings to the house of Jehovah.
030:016 And they stand on their station according to their ordinance; according to the law of Moses the man of God the priests are sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the Levites,
030:017 for many are in the assembly who have not sanctified themselves, and the Levites are over the slaughtering of the passover-offerings for every one not clean, to sanctify him to Jehovah:
030:018 for a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, have not been cleansed, but have eaten the passover otherwise than it is written; but Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, ‘Jehovah, who is good, doth receive atonement for every one
030:019 who hath prepared his heart to seek God-Jehovah, God of his fathers-yet not according to the cleansing of the sanctuary;’
030:020 and Jehovah hearkeneth unto Hezekiah, and healeth the people.
030:021 And the sons of Israel, those found in Jerusalem, make the feast of unleavened things seven days with great joy; and giving praise to Jehovah day by day are the Levites and the priests, with instruments of praise before Jehovah.
030:022 And Hezekiah speaketh unto the heart of all the Levites, those giving good understanding concerning Jehovah, and they eat the appointed thing seven days; sacrificing sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, God of their fathers.
030:023 And all the assembly take counsel to keep other seven days, and they keep seven days with joy;
030:024 for Hezekiah king of Judah hath presented to the assembly a thousand bullocks, and seven thousand sheep; and the heads have presented to the assembly bullocks a thousand, and sheep ten thousand; and priests sanctify themselves in abundance.
030:025 And all the assembly of Judah rejoice, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the assembly, those coming in from Israel, and the sojourners, those coming in from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah,
030:026 and there is great joy in Jerusalem; for from the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there is not like this in Jerusalem,
030:027 and the priests, the Levites, rise and bless the people, and their voice is heard, and their prayer cometh in to His holy habitation, to the heavens.
031:001 ¶  And at the completion of all this, gone out have all Israel who are found present to the cities of Judah, and break the standing-pillars, and cut down the shrines, and break down the high places and the altars, out of all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, even to completion, and all the sons of Israel turn back, each to his Possession, to their cities.
031:002 And Hezekiah appointeth the courses of the priests, and of the Levites, by their courses, each according to his service, of the priests and of the Levites, for burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to give praise in the gates of the camps of Jehovah.
031:003 And a portion of the king, from his substance, is for burnt-offerings, for burnt-offerings of the morning, and of the evening, and the burnt-offerings of sabbaths, and of new moons, and of appointed seasons, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.
031:004 And he saith to the people, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests, and of the Levites, so that they are strengthened in the law of Jehovah;
031:005 and at the spreading forth of the thing have the sons of Israel multiplied the first-fruit of corn, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field, and the tithe of the whole in abundance they have brought in.
031:006 And the sons of Israel and Judah, those dwelling in cities of Judah, they also a tithe of herd and flock, and a tithe of the holy things that are sanctified to Jehovah their God, have brought in, and they give-heaps, heaps;
031:007 in the third month they have begun to lay the foundation of the heaps, and in the seventh month they have finished.
031:008 And Hezekiah and the heads come in and see the heaps, and bless Jehovah and His people Israel,
031:009 and Hezekiah inquireth at the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps,
031:010 and Azariah the head priest, of the house of Zadok, speaketh unto him, and saith, ‘From the beginning of the bringing of the heave-offering to the house of Jehovah, there is to eat, and to be satisfied, and to leave abundantly, for Jehovah hath blessed His people, and that left is this store.’
031:011 And Hezekiah saith to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah, and they prepare,
031:012 and they bring in the heave-offering, and the tithe, and the holy things faithfully; and over them is a leader, Conaniah the Levite, and Shimei his brother is second;
031:013 and Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, are inspectors under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah leader of the house of God.
031:014 And Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east, is over the willing-offerings of God, to give the heave-offering of Jehovah, and the most holy things.
031:015 And by his hand are Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shechaniah, in cities of the priests, faithfully to give to their brethren in courses, as the great so the small,
031:016 apart from their genealogy, to males from a son of three years and upward, to every one who hath gone in to the house of Jehovah, by the matter of a day in its day, for their service in their charges, according to their courses;
031:017 and the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and of the Levites, from a son of twenty years and upward, in their charges, in their courses;
031:018 and to the genealogy among all their infants, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters to all the congregation, for in their faithfulness they sanctify themselves in holiness.
031:019 And to sons of Aaron, the priests, in the fields of the suburb of their cities, in every city and city, are men who have been defined by name, to give portions to every male among the priests, and to every one who reckoned himself by genealogy among the Levites.
031:020 And Hezekiah doth thus in all Judah, and doth that which is good, and that which is right, and that which is true, before Jehovah his God;
031:021 and in every work that he hath begun for the service of the house of God, and for the law, and for the command, to seek to his God, with all his heart he hath wrought and prospered.
032:001 ¶  After these things and this truth, come hath Sennacherib king of Asshur, yea, he cometh in to Judah, and encampeth against the cities of the bulwarks, and saith to rend them unto himself.
032:002 And Hezekiah seeth that Sennacherib hath come, and his face is to the battle against Jerusalem,
032:003 and he taketh counsel with his heads and his mighty ones, to stop the waters of the fountains that are at the outside of the city-and they help him,
032:004 and much people are gathered, and they stop all the fountains and the brook that is rushing into the midst of the land, saying, ‘Why do the kings of Asshur come, and have found much water?’
032:005 And he strengtheneth himself, and buildeth the whole of the wall that is broken, and causeth it to ascend unto the towers, and at the outside of the wall another, and strengtheneth Millo, in the city of David, and maketh darts in abundance, and shields.
032:006 And he putteth heads of war over the people, and gathereth them unto him, unto the broad place of a gate of the city, and speaketh unto their heart, saying,
032:007 ‘Be strong and courageous, be not afraid, nor be cast down from the face of the king of Asshur, and from the face of all the multitude that is with him, for with us are more than with him.
032:008 With him is an arm of flesh, and with us is Jehovah our God, to help us, and to fight our battles;’ and the people are supported by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
032:009 After this hath Sennacherib king of Asshur sent his servants to Jerusalem-and he is by Lachish, and all his power with him-against Hezekiah king of Judah, and against all Judah, who are in Jerusalem, saying,
032:010 ‘Thus said Sennacherib king of Asshur, On what are ye trusting and abiding in the bulwark, in Jerusalem?
032:011 ‘Is not Hezekiah persuading you, to give you up to die by famine, and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God doth deliver us from the hand of the king of Asshur?
032:012 Hath not Hezekiah himself turned aside His high places, and His altars, and speaketh to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar ye bow yourselves, and on it ye make perfume?
032:013 ‘Do ye not know what I have done-I and my fathers-to all peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?
032:014 Who among all the gods of these nations whom my fathers have devoted to destruction is he who hath been able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your God is able to deliver you out of my hand?
032:015 ‘And, now, let not Hezekiah lift you up, nor persuade you thus, nor give credence to him, for no god of any nation and kingdom is able to deliver his people from my hand, and from the hand of my fathers: also, surely your God doth not deliver you from my hand!’
032:016 And again have his servants spoken against Jehovah God, and against Hezekiah His servant,
032:017 and letters he hath written to give reproach to Jehovah, God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, ‘As the gods of the nations of the lands that have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah doth not deliver His people from my hand.’
032:018 And they call with a great voice in Jewish, against the people of Jerusalem who are on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them, that they may capture the city,
032:019 and they speak against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the land-work of the hands of man.
032:020 And Hezekiah the king prayeth, and Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, concerning this, and they cry to the heavens,
032:021 and Jehovah sendeth a messenger, and cutteth off every mighty one of valour-both leader and head-in the camp of the king of Asshur, and he turneth back with shame of face to his land, and entereth the house of his god, and those coming out of his bowels have caused him to fall there by the sword.
032:022 And Jehovah saveth Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Asshur, and from the hand of all, and He leadeth them round about;
032:023 and many are bringing in an offering to Jehovah, to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, and he is lifted up before the eyes of all the nations after this.
032:024 In those days hath Hezekiah been sick even unto death, and he prayeth unto Jehovah, and He speaketh to him, and a wonder hath appointed for him;
032:025 and Hezekiah hath not returned according to the deed done unto him, for his heart hath been lofty, and there is wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem;
032:026 and Hezekiah is humbled for the loftiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the wrath of Jehovah hath not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
032:027 And Hezekiah hath riches and honour very much, and treasures he hath made to himself of silver, and of gold, and of precious stone, and of spices, and of shields, and of all kinds of desirable vessels,
032:028 and storehouses for the increase of corn, and new wine, and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and herds for stalls;
032:029 and cities he hath made for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance, for God hath given to him very much substance.
032:030 And Hezekiah himself hath stopped the upper source of the waters of Gihon, and directeth them beneath to the west of the city of David, and Hezekiah prospereth in all his work;
032:031 and so with the ambassadors of the heads of Babylon, those sending unto him to inquire of the wonder that hath been in the land, God hath left him to try him, to know all in his heart,
032:032 And the rest of the matters of Hezekiah, and his kind acts, lo, they are written in the vision of Isaiah son of Amoz the prophet, on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
032:033 And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the uppermost of the graves of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have done honour to him at his death, and reign doth Manasseh his son in his stead.
033:001 ¶  A son of twelve years is Manasseh in his reigning, and fifty and five years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;
033:002 and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, like the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the presence of the sons of Israel,
033:003 and he turneth and buildeth the high places that Hezekiah his father hath broken down, and raiseth altars for Baalim, and maketh shrines, and boweth himself to all the host of the heavens, and serveth them.
033:004 And he hath built altars in the house of Jehovah of which Jehovah had said, ‘In Jerusalem is My name to the age.’
033:005 And he buildeth altars to all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
033:006 And he hath caused his sons to pass over through fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and observed clouds and used enchantments and witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and a wizard; he hath multiplied to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
033:007 And he placeth the graven image of the idol that he made in the house of God, of which God said unto David, and unto Solomon his son, ‘In this house, and in Jerusalem that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I put My name to the age,
033:008 and I add not to turn aside the foot of Israel from off the ground that I appointed to your fathers, only, if they watch to do all that I have commanded them-to all the law, and the statutes, and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.’
033:009 And Manasseh maketh Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, to do evil above the nations that Jehovah destroyed from the presence of the sons of Israel.
033:010 And Jehovah speaketh unto Manasseh and unto his people, and they have not attended,
033:011 and Jehovah bringeth in against them the heads of the host that the king of Asshur hath, and they capture Manasseh among the thickets, and bind him with brazen fetters, and cause him to go to Babylon.
033:012 And when he is in distress he hath appeased the face of Jehovah his God, and is humbled exceedingly before the God of his fathers,
033:013 and prayeth unto Him, and He is entreated of him, and heareth his supplication, and bringeth him back to Jerusalem, to his kingdom, and Manasseh knoweth that Jehovah-He is God.
033:014 And after this he hath built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entering in at the fish-gate, and it hath gone round to the tower, and he maketh it exceeding high, and he putteth heads of the force in all the cities of the bulwarks in Judah.
033:015 And he turneth aside the gods of the stranger, and the idol, out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem, and casteth them to the outside of the city.
033:016 And he buildeth the altar of Jehovah, and sacrificeth upon it sacrifices of peace-offerings and thank-offering, and saith to Judah to serve Jehovah, God of Israel;
033:017 but still the people are sacrificing in high places, only-to Jehovah their God.
033:018 And the rest of the matters of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the matters of the seers, those speaking unto him in the name of Jehovah, God of Israel, lo, they are on the book of the matters of the kings of Israel;
033:019 and his prayer, and his entreaty, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places in which he had built high places, and established the shrines and the graven images before his being humbled, lo, they are written beside the matters of Hozai.
033:020 And Manasseh lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in his own house, and reign doth Amon his son in his stead.
033:021 A son of twenty and two years is Amon in his reigning, and two years he hath reigned in Jerusalem,
033:022 and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father, and to all the graven images that Manasseh his father had made hath Amon sacrificed, and serveth them,
033:023 and hath not been humbled before Jehovah, like the humbling of Manasseh his father, for Amon himself hath multiplied guilt.
033:024 And his servants conspire against him, and put him to death in his own house,
033:025 and the people of the land smite all those conspiring against king Amon, and the people of the land cause Josiah his son to reign in his stead.
034:001 ¶  A son of eight years is Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years he hath reigned in Jerusalem,
034:002 and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walketh in the ways of David his father, and hath not turned aside-right or left.
034:003 And in the eighth year of his reign (and he yet a youth), he hath begun to seek to the God of David his father, and in the twelfth year he hath begun to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the shrines, and the graven images, and the molten images.
034:004 And they break down before him the altars of the Baalim, and the images that are on high above them he hath cut down, and the shrines, and the graven images, and the molten images, he hath broken and beaten small, and streweth on the surface of the graves of those sacrificing to them,
034:005 and the bones of the priests he hath burnt on their altars, and cleanseth Judah and Jerusalem,
034:006 and in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their tools, round about.
034:007 And he breaketh down the altars and the shrines, and the graven images he hath beaten down very small, and all the images he hath cut down in all the land of Israel, and turneth back to Jerusalem.
034:008 And in the eighteenth year of his reign, to purify the land and the house he hath sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah head of the city, and Joah son of Johaz the remembrancer, to strengthen the house of Jehovah his God.
034:009 And they come in unto Hilkiah the high priest, and they give the money that is brought in to the house of God, that the Levites, keeping the threshold, have gathered from the hand of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah, and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
034:010 and they give it into the hand of the workmen, those appointed over the house of Jehovah, and they give it to the workmen who are working in the house of Jehovah, to repair and to strengthen the house;
034:011 and they give it to artificers, and to builders, to buy hewn stones, and wood for couplings and for beams to the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed.
034:012 And the men are working faithfully in the business, and over them are appointed Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathite, to overlook; and of the Levites, every one understanding about instruments of song,
034:013 and over the burden-bearers, and overseers of every one doing work for service and service; and of the Levites are scribes, and officers, and gatekeepers.
034:014 And in their bringing out the money that is brought in to the house of Jehovah, hath Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah by the hand of Moses,
034:015 and Hilkiah answereth and saith unto Shaphan the scribe, ‘A book of the law I have found in the house of Jehovah;’ and Hilkiah giveth the book unto Shaphan,
034:016 and Shaphan bringeth in the book unto the king, and bringeth the king back word again, saying, ‘All that hath been given into the hand of thy servants they are doing,
034:017 and they pour out the money that is found in the house of Jehovah, and give it into the hand of those appointed, and into the hands of those doing the work.’
034:018 And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king, saying, ‘A book hath Hilkiah the priest given to me;’ and Shaphan readeth in it before the king.
034:019 And it cometh to pass, at the king’s hearing the words of the law, that he rendeth his garments,
034:020 and the king commandeth Hilkiah, and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Abdon son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, servant of the king, saying,
034:021 ‘Go, seek Jehovah for me, and for him who is left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found, for great is the fury of Jehovah that is poured on us, because that our fathers kept not the word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written on this book.’
034:022 And Hilkiah goeth, and they of the king, unto Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tikvath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the garments, and she is dwelling in Jerusalem in the Second, and they speak unto her thus.
034:023 And she saith to them, ‘Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Say to the man who hath sent you unto me,
034:024 Thus said Jehovah, Lo, I am bringing in evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, all the execrations that are written on the book that they read before the king of Judah;
034:025 because that they have forsaken Me, and make perfume to other gods, so as to provoke Me with all the works of their hands, and poured out is My fury upon this place, and it is not quenched.
034:026 ‘And unto the king of Judah, who is sending you to inquire of Jehovah, thus do ye say unto him: Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, whose words thou hast heard:
034:027 Because thy heart is tender, and thou art humbled before God in thy hearing His words concerning this place, and concerning its inhabitants, and art humbled before Me, and dost rend thy garments, and weep before Me: even I also have heard-the affirmation of Jehovah.
034:028 Lo, I am gathering thee unto thy fathers, and thou hast been gathered unto thy graves in peace, and thine eyes do not look on all the evil that I am bringing upon this place, and upon its inhabitants;’ and they bring the king back word.
034:029 And the king sendeth and gathereth all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem,
034:030 and the king goeth up to the house of Jehovah, and every man of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, even all the people, from great even unto small, and he readeth in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that is found in the house of Jehovah.
034:031 And the king standeth on his station, and maketh the covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commands, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to do the words of the covenant that are written on this book.
034:032 And he presenteth every one who is found in Jerusalem and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem do according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
034:033 And Josiah turneth aside all the abominations out of all the lands that the sons of Israel have, and causeth every one who is found in Israel to serve, to serve Jehovah their God; all his days they turned not aside from after Jehovah, God of their fathers.
035:001 ¶  And Josiah maketh in Jerusalem a passover to Jehovah, and they slaughter the passover-offering on the fourteenth of the first month,
035:002 and he stationeth the priests over their charges, and strengtheneth them for the service of the house of Jehovah,
035:003 and saith to the Levites-who are teaching all Israel-who are sanctified to Jehovah, ‘Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon son of David king of Israel built; it is not to you a burden on the shoulder. ‘Now, serve Jehovah your God, and His people Israel,
035:004 and prepare, by the house of your fathers, according to your courses, by the writing of David king of Israel, and by the writing of Solomon his son,
035:005 and stand in the sanctuary, by the divisions of the house of the fathers of your brethren, sons of the people, and the portion of the house of a father of the Levites,
035:006 and slaughter the passover-offering and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.’
035:007 And Josiah lifteth up to the sons of the people a flock of lambs and young goats, the whole for passover-offerings, for every one who is found, to the number of thirty thousand, and oxen three thousand: these are from the substance of the king.
035:008 And his heads, for a willing-offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites, have lifted up; Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Jehiel, leaders in the house of God, to the priests have given for passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred, and oxen three hundred;
035:009 and Conaniah, and Shemaiah, and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, heads of the Levites, have lifted up to the Levites, for passover-offerings, five thousand, and oxen five hundred.
035:010 And the service is prepared, and the priests stand on their station, and the Levites on their courses, according to the command of the king,
035:011 and they slaughter the passover-offering, and the priests sprinkle out of their hand, and the Levites are striping;
035:012 and they turn aside the burnt-offering, to put them by the divisions of the house of the fathers of the sons of the people, to bring near to Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses-and so to the oxen.
035:013 And they cook the passover with fire, according to the ordinance, and the sanctified things they have cooked in pots, and in kettles, and in pans-for all the sons of the people.
035:014 And afterward they have prepared for themselves, and for the priests: for the priests, sons of Aaron, are in the offering up of the burnt-offering and of the fat till night; and the Levites have prepared for themselves, and for the priests, sons of Aaron.
035:015 And the singers, sons of Asaph, are on their station, according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun seer of the king, and the gate keepers are at gate and gate; it is not for them to turn aside from off their service, for their brethren the Levites have prepared for them.
035:016 And all the service of Jehovah is prepared on that day, to keep the passover, and to cause to ascend burnt-offering upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the command of king Josiah.
035:017 And the sons of Israel who are found make the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened things, seven days.
035:018 And there hath not been made a passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, and none of the kings of Israel made such a passover as Josiah hath made, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who are found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
035:019 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah hath this passover been made.
035:020 After all this, when Josiah hath prepared the house, come up hath Necho king of Egypt, to fight against Carchemish by Phrat, and Josiah goeth forth to meet him;
035:021 and he sendeth unto him messengers, saying, ‘What-to me and to thee, O king of Judah? not against thee do I come to-day, but unto the house with which I have war, and God said to haste me; cease for thee from God who is with me, and He doth not destroy thee.’
035:022 And Josiah hath not turned round his face from him, but to fight against him hath disguised himself, and hath not hearkened unto the words of Necho, from the mouth of God, and cometh in to fight in the valley of Megiddo;
035:023 and the archers shoot at king Josiah, and the king saith to his servants, ‘Remove me, for I have become very sick.’
035:024 And his servants remove him from the chariot, and cause him to ride on the second chariot that he hath, and cause him to go to Jerusalem, and he dieth, and is buried in the graves of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem are mourning for Josiah,
035:025 and Jeremiah lamenteth for Josiah, and all the singers and the songstresses speak in their lamentations of Josiah unto this day, and set them for a statute on Israel, and lo, they are written beside the lamentations.
035:026 And the rest of the matters of Josiah, and his kind acts, according as it is written in the law of Jehovah,
035:027 even his matters, the first and the last, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
036:001 ¶  And the people of the land take Jehoahaz son of Josiah, and cause him to reign instead of his father in Jerusalem.
036:002 A son of three and twenty years is Jehoahaz in his reigning, and three months he hath reigned in Jerusalem,
036:003 and turn him aside doth the king of Egypt in Jerusalem, and fineth the land a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold;
036:004 and the king of Egypt causeth Eliakim his brother to reign over Judah and Jerusalem, and turneth his name to Jehoiakim; and Jehoahaz his brother hath Necho taken, and bringeth him in to Egypt.
036:005 A son of twenty and five years is Jehoiakim in his reigning, and eleven years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah his God;
036:006 against him hath Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon come up, and bindeth him in brazen fetters to take him away to Babylon.
036:007 And of the vessels of the house of Jehovah hath Nebuchadnezzar brought in to Babylon, and putteth them in his temple in Babylon.
036:008 And the rest of the matters of Jehoiakim, and his abominations that he hath done, and that which is found against him, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, and reign doth Jehoiachin his son in his stead.
036:009 A son of eight years is Jehoiachin in his reigning, and three months and ten days he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah;
036:010 and at the turn of the year hath king Nebuchadnezzar sent and bringeth him in to Babylon, with the desirable vessels of the house of Jehovah, and causeth Zedekiah his brother to reign over Judah and Jerusalem.
036:011 A son of twenty and one years is Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;
036:012 and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah his God, he hath not been humbled before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Jehovah;
036:013 and also, against king Nebuchadnezzar he hath rebelled, who had caused him to swear by God, and he hardeneth his neck, and strengtheneth his heart, against turning back unto Jehovah, God of Israel.
036:014 Also, all the heads of the priests, and the people, having multiplied to commit a trespass according to all the abominations of the nations, and they defile the house of Jehovah that He hath sanctified in Jerusalem.
036:015 And Jehovah, God of their fathers, sendeth unto them by the hand of His messengers-rising early and sending-for He hath had pity on His people, and on His habitation,
036:016 and they are mocking at the messengers of God, and despising His words, and acting deceitfully with His prophets, till the going up of the fury of Jehovah against His people-till there is no healing.
036:017 And He causeth to go up against them the king of the Chaldeans, and he slayeth their chosen ones by the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and hath had no pity on young man and virgin, old man and very aged-the whole He hath given into his hand.
036:018 And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king and of his princes-the whole he hath brought in to Babylon.
036:019 And they burn the house of God, and break down the wall of Jerusalem, and all its palaces they have burnt with fire, and all its desirable vessels-to destruction.
036:020 And he removeth those left of the sword unto Babylon, and they are to him and to his sons for servants, till the reigning of the kingdom of Persia,
036:021 to fulfil the word of Jehovah in the mouth of Jeremiah, till the land hath enjoyed its sabbaths; all the days of the desolation it kept sabbath-to the fulness of seventy years.
036:022 And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, at the completion of the word of Jehovah in the mouth of Jeremiah, hath Jehovah waked up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he causeth an intimation to pass over into all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,
036:023 ‘Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, All kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, God of the heavens, given to me, and He hath laid a charge on me to build to Him a house in Jerusalem, that is in Judah; who is among you of all His people? Jehovah his God is with him, and he doth go up.’
