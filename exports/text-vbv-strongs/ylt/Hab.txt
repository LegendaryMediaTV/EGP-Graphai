001:001 ¶  The burden that Habakkuk the prophet hath seen:
001:002 Till when, O Jehovah, have I cried, And Thou dost not hear? I cry unto Thee-‘Violence,’ and Thou dost not save.
001:003 Why dost Thou shew me iniquity, And perversity dost cause to behold? And spoiling and violence are before me, And there is strife, and contention doth lift itself up,
001:004 Therefore doth law cease, And judgment doth not go forth for ever, For the wicked is compassing the righteous, Therefore wrong judgment goeth forth.
001:005 Look ye on nations, and behold and marvel greatly. For a work He is working in your days, Ye do not believe though it is declared.
001:006 For, lo, I am raising up the Chaldeans, The bitter and hasty nation, That is going to the broad places of earth, To occupy tabernacles not its own.
001:007 Terrible and fearful it is, From itself its judgment and its excellency go forth.
001:008 Swifter than leopards have been its horses, And sharper than evening wolves, And increased have its horsemen, Even its horsemen from afar come in, They fly as an eagle, hasting to consume.
001:009 Wholly for violence it doth come in, Their faces swallowing up the east wind, And it doth gather as the sand a captivity.
001:010 And at kings it doth scoff, And princes are a laughter to it, At every fenced place it doth laugh, And it heapeth up dust, and captureth it.
001:011 Then passed on hath the spirit, Yea, he doth transgress, And doth ascribe this his power to his god.
001:012 Art not Thou of old, O Jehovah, my God, my Holy One? We do not die, O Jehovah, For judgment Thou hast appointed it, And, O Rock, for reproof Thou hast founded it.
001:013 Purer of eyes than to behold evil, To look on perverseness Thou art not able, Why dost Thou behold the treacherous? Thou keepest silent when the wicked Doth swallow the more righteous than he,
001:014 And Thou makest man as fishes of the sea, As a creeping thing-none ruling over him.
001:015 Each of them with a hook he hath brought up, He doth catch it in his net, and gathereth it in his drag, Therefore he doth joy and rejoice.
001:016 Therefore he doth sacrifice to his net, And doth make perfume to his drag, For by them is his portion fertile, and his food fat.
001:017 Doth he therefore empty his net, And continually to slay nations spare not?
002:001 ¶  On my charge I stand, and I station myself on a bulwark, and I watch to see what He doth speak against me, and what I do reply to my reproof.
002:002 And Jehovah answereth me and saith: ‘Write a vision, and explain on the tables, That he may run who is reading it.
002:003 For yet the vision is for a season, And it breatheth for the end, and doth not lie, If it tarry, wait for it, For surely it cometh, it is not late.
002:004 Lo, a presumptuous one! Not upright is his soul within him, And the righteous by his stedfastness liveth.
002:005 And also, because the wine is treacherous, A man is haughty, and remaineth not at home, Who hath enlarged as sheol his soul, And is as death that is not satisfied, And doth gather unto itself all the nations, And doth assemble unto itself all the peoples,
002:006 Do not these-all of them-against him a simile taken up, And a moral of acute sayings for him, And say, Woe to him who is multiplying what is not his? Till when also is he multiplying to himself heavy pledges?
002:007 Do not thy usurers instantly rise up, And those shaking thee awake up, And thou hast been for a spoil to them?
002:008 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, Spoil thee do all the remnant of the peoples, Because of man’s blood, and of violence to the land, To the city, and to all dwelling in it.
002:009 Woe to him who is gaining evil gain for his house, To set on high his nest, To be delivered from the hand of evil,
002:010 Thou hast counselled a shameful thing to thy house, To cut off many peoples, and sinful is thy soul.
002:011 For a stone from the wall doth cry out, And a holdfast from the wood answereth it.
002:012 Woe to him who is building a city by blood, And establishing a city by iniquity.
002:013 Lo, is it not from Jehovah of Hosts And peoples are fatigued for fire, And nations for vanity are weary?
002:014 For full is the earth of the knowledge of the honour of Jehovah, As waters cover the bottom of a sea.
002:015 Woe to him who is giving drink to his neighbour, Pouring out thy bottle, and also making drunk, In order to look on their nakedness.
002:016 Thou hast been filled-shame without honour, Drink thou also, and be uncircumcised, Turn round unto thee doth the cup of the right hand of Jehovah, And shameful spewing is on thine honour.
002:017 For violence to Lebanon doth cover thee, And spoil of beasts doth affright them, Because of man’s blood, and of violence to the land, To the city, and to all dwelling in it.
002:018 What profit hath a graven image given That its former hath graven it? A molten image and teacher of falsehood, That trusted hath the former on his own formation-to make dumb idols?
002:019 Woe to him who is saying to wood, ‘Awake,’ ‘Stir up,’ to a dumb stone, It a teacher! lo, it is overlaid-gold and silver, And there is no spirit in its midst.
002:020 And Jehovah is in His holy temple, Be silent before Him, all the earth!
003:001 ¶  A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet concerning erring ones:
003:002 O Jehovah, I heard thy report, I have been afraid, O Jehovah, Thy work! in midst of years revive it, In the midst of years Thou makest known In anger Thou dost remember mercy.
003:003 God from Teman doth come, The Holy One from mount Paran. Pause! Covered the heavens hath His majesty, And His praise hath filled the earth.
003:004 And the brightness is as the light, He hath rays out of His hand, And there-the hiding of His strength.
003:005 Before Him goeth pestilence, And a burning flame goeth forth at His feet.
003:006 He hath stood, and He measureth earth, He hath seen, and He shaketh off nations, And scatter themselves do mountains of antiquity, Bowed have the hills of old, The ways of old are His.
003:007 Under sorrow I have seen tents of Cushan, Tremble do curtains of the land of Midian.
003:008 Against rivers hath Jehovah been wroth? Against rivers is Thine anger? Against the sea is Thy wrath? For Thou dost ride on Thy horses- Thy chariots of salvation?
003:009 Utterly naked Thou dost make Thy bow, Sworn are the tribes-saying, ‘Pause!’ With rivers Thou dost cleave the earth.
003:010 Seen thee-pained are mountains, An inundation of waters hath passed over, Given forth hath the deep its voice, High its hands it hath lifted up.
003:011 Sun-moon-hath stood-a habitation, At the light thine arrows go on, At the brightness, the glittering of thy spear.
003:012 In indignation Thou dost tread earth, In anger Thou dost thresh nations.
003:013 Thou hast gone forth for the salvation of Thy people, For salvation with Thine anointed, Thou hast smitten the head of the house of the wicked, Laying bare the foundation unto the neck. Pause!
003:014 Thou hast pierced with his staves the head of his leaders, They are tempestuous to scatter me, Their exultation is as to consume the poor in secret.
003:015 Thou hast proceeded through the sea with Thy horses-the clay of many waters.
003:016 I have heard, and my belly trembleth, At the noise have my lips quivered, Rottenness doth come into my bones, And in my place I do tremble, That I rest for a day of distress, At the coming up of the people, he overcometh it.
003:017 Though the fig-tree doth not flourish, And there is no produce among vines, Failed hath the work of the olive, And fields have not yielded food, Cut off from the fold hath been the flock, And there is no herd in the stalls.
003:018 Yet I, in Jehovah I exult, I do joy in the God of my salvation.
003:019 Jehovah the Lord is my strength, And He doth make my feet like hinds, And on my high-places causeth me to tread. To the overseer with my stringed instruments!
