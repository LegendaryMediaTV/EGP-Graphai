001:001 ¶  O the happiness of that one, who Hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked. And in the way of sinners hath not stood, And in the seat of scorners hath not sat;
001:002 But-in the law of Jehovah is his delight, And in His law he doth meditate by day and by night:
001:003 And he hath been as a tree, Planted by rivulets of water, That giveth its fruit in its season, And its leaf doth not wither, And all that he doth he causeth to prosper.
001:004 Not so the wicked: But-as chaff that wind driveth away!
001:005 Therefore the wicked rise not in judgment, Nor sinners in the company of the righteous,
001:006 For Jehovah is knowing the way of the righteous, And the way of the wicked is lost!
002:001 ¶  Why have nations tumultuously assembled? And do peoples meditate vanity?
002:002 Station themselves do kings of the earth, And princes have been united together, Against Jehovah, and against His Messiah:
002:003 ‘Let us draw off Their cords, And cast from us Their thick bands.’
002:004 He who is sitting in the heavens doth laugh, The Lord doth mock at them.
002:005 Then doth He speak unto them in His anger, And in His wrath He doth trouble them:
002:006 ‘And I-I have anointed My King, Upon Zion-My holy hill.’
002:007 I declare concerning a statute: Jehovah said unto me, ‘My Son Thou art, I to-day have brought thee forth.
002:008 Ask of Me and I give nations-thy inheritance, And thy possession-the ends of earth.
002:009 Thou dost rule them with a sceptre of iron, As a vessel of a potter Thou dost crush them.’
002:010 And now, O kings, act wisely, Be instructed, O judges of earth,
002:011 Serve ye Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
002:012 Kiss the Chosen One, lest He be angry, And ye lose the way, When His anger burneth but a little, O the happiness of all trusting in Him!
003:001 ¶  Jehovah, how have my distresses multiplied! Many are rising up against me.
003:002 Many are saying of my soul, ‘There is no salvation for him in God.’ Selah.
003:003 And Thou, O Jehovah, art a shield for me, My honour, and lifter up of my head.
003:004 My voice is unto Jehovah: I call: And He answereth me from his holy hill, Selah.
003:005 I-I have lain down, and I sleep, I have waked, for Jehovah sustaineth me.
003:006 I am not afraid of myriads of people, That round about they have set against me.
003:007 Rise, O Jehovah! save me, my God. Because Thou hast smitten All mine enemies on the cheek. The teeth of the wicked Thou hast broken.
003:008 Of Jehovah is this salvation; On Thy people is Thy blessing! Selah.
004:001 ¶  In my calling answer Thou me, O God of my righteousness. In adversity Thou gavest enlargement to me; Favour me, and hear my prayer.
004:002 Sons of men! till when is my glory for shame? Ye love a vain thing, ye seek a lie. Selah.
004:003 And know ye that Jehovah Hath separated a saintly one to Himself. Jehovah heareth in my calling to Him.
004:004 ‘Tremble ye, and do not sin;’ Say ye thus in your heart on your bed, And be ye silent. Selah.
004:005 Sacrifice ye sacrifices of righteousness, And trust ye unto Jehovah.
004:006 Many are saying, ‘Who doth show us good?’ Lift on us the light of Thy face, O Jehovah,
004:007 Thou hast given joy in my heart, From the time their corn and their wine Have been multiplied.
004:008 In peace together I lie down and sleep, For Thou, O Jehovah, alone, In confidence dost cause me to dwell!
005:001 ¶  My sayings hear, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.
005:002 Be attentive to the voice of my cry, My king and my God, For unto Thee I pray habitually.
005:003 Jehovah, at morning Thou hearest my voice, At morning I set in array for Thee, And I look out.
005:004 For not a God desiring wickedness art Thou, Evil inhabiteth Thee not.
005:005 The boastful station not themselves before Thine eyes: Thou hast hated all working iniquity.
005:006 Thou destroyest those speaking lies, A man of blood and deceit Jehovah doth abominate.
005:007 And I, in the abundance of Thy kindness, I enter Thy house, I bow myself toward Thy holy temple in Thy fear.
005:008 O Jehovah, lead me in Thy righteousness, Because of those observing me, Make straight before me Thy way,
005:009 For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart is mischiefs, An open grave is their throat, Their tongue they make smooth.
005:010 Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall from their own counsels, In the abundance of their transgressions Drive them away, Because they have rebelled against Thee.
005:011 And rejoice do all trusting in Thee, To the age they sing, and Thou coverest them over, And those loving Thy name exult in Thee.
005:012 For Thou blessest the righteous, O Jehovah, As a buckler with favour dost compass him!
006:001 ¶  O Jehovah, in Thine anger reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me.
006:002 Favour me, O Jehovah, for I am weak, Heal me, O Jehovah, For troubled have been my bones,
006:003 And my soul hath been troubled greatly, And Thou, O Jehovah, till when?
006:004 Turn back, O Jehovah, draw out my soul, Save me for Thy kindness’ sake.
006:005 For there is not in death Thy memorial, In Sheol, who doth give thanks to Thee?
006:006 I have been weary with my sighing, I meditate through all the night on my bed, With my tear my couch I waste.
006:007 Old from provocation is mine eye, It is old because of all mine adversaries,
006:008 Turn from me all ye workers of iniquity, For Jehovah heard the voice of my weeping,
006:009 Jehovah hath heard my supplication, Jehovah my prayer receiveth.
006:010 Ashamed and troubled greatly are all mine enemies, They turn back-ashamed in a moment!
007:001 ¶  O Jehovah, my God, in Thee I have trusted, Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me.
007:002 Lest he tear as a lion my soul, Rending, and there is no deliverer.
007:003 O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this, If there is iniquity in my hands,
007:004 If I have done my well-wisher evil, And draw mine adversary without cause,
007:005 An enemy pursueth my soul, and overtaketh, And treadeth down to the earth my life, And my honour placeth in the dust. Selah.
007:006 Rise, O Jehovah, in Thine anger, Be lifted up at the wrath of mine adversaries, And awake Thou for me: Judgment Thou hast commanded:
007:007 And a company of peoples compass Thee, And over it on high turn Thou back,
007:008 Jehovah doth judge the peoples; Judge me, O Jehovah, According to my righteousness, And according to mine integrity on me,
007:009 Let, I pray Thee be ended the evil of the wicked, And establish Thou the righteous, And a trier of hearts and reins is the righteous God.
007:010 My shield is on God, Saviour of the upright in heart!
007:011 God is a righteous judge, And He is not angry at all times.
007:012 If one turn not, His sword he sharpeneth, His bow he hath trodden-He prepareth it,
007:013 Yea, for him He hath prepared Instruments of death, His arrows for burning pursuers He maketh.
007:014 Lo, he travaileth with iniquity, And he hath conceived perverseness, And hath brought forth falsehood.
007:015 A pit he hath prepared, and he diggeth it, And he falleth into a ditch he maketh.
007:016 Return doth his perverseness on his head, And on his crown his violence cometh down.
007:017 I thank Jehovah, According to His righteousness, And praise the name of Jehovah Most High!
008:001 ¶  Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth! Who settest thine honour on the heavens.
008:002 From the mouths of infants and sucklings Thou hast founded strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To still an enemy and a self-avenger.
008:003 For I see Thy heavens, a work of Thy fingers, Moon and stars that Thou didst establish.
008:004 What is man that Thou rememberest him? The son of man that Thou inspectest him?
008:005 And causest him to lack a little of Godhead, And with honour and majesty compassest him.
008:006 Thou dost cause him to rule Over the works of Thy hands, All Thou hast placed under his feet.
008:007 Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also beasts of the field,
008:008 Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas!
008:009 Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth!
009:001 ¶  I confess, O Jehovah, with all my heart, I recount all Thy wonders,
009:002 I rejoice and exult in Thee, I praise Thy Name, O Most High.
009:003 In mine enemies turning backward, they stumble and perish from Thy face.
009:004 For Thou hast done my judgment and my right. Thou hast sat on a throne, A judge of righteousness.
009:005 Thou hast rebuked nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Their name Thou hast blotted out to the age and for ever.
009:006 O thou Enemy, Finished have been destructions for ever, As to cities thou hast plucked up, Perished hath their memorial with them.
009:007 And Jehovah to the age abideth, He is preparing for judgment His throne.
009:008 And He judgeth the world in righteousness, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.
009:009 And Jehovah is a tower for the bruised, A tower for times of adversity.
009:010 They trust in Thee who do know Thy name, For Thou hast not forsaken Those seeking Thee, O Jehovah.
009:011 Sing ye praise to Jehovah, inhabiting Zion, Declare ye among the peoples His acts,
009:012 For He who is seeking for blood Them hath remembered, He hath not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.
009:013 Favour me, O Jehovah, See mine affliction by those hating me, Thou who liftest me up from the gates of death,
009:014 So that I recount all Thy praise, In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Thy salvation.
009:015 Sunk have nations in a pit they made, In a net that they hid hath their foot been captured.
009:016 Jehovah hath been known, Judgment He hath done, By a work of his hands Hath the wicked been snared. Meditation. Selah.
009:017 The wicked do turn back to Sheol, All nations forgetting God.
009:018 For not for ever is the needy forgotten, The hope of the humble lost to the age.
009:019 Rise, O Jehovah, let not man be strong, Let nations be judged before Thy face.
009:020 Appoint, O Jehovah, a director to them, Let nations know they are men! Selah.
010:001 ¶  Why, Jehovah, dost Thou stand at a distance? Thou dost hide in times of adversity,
010:002 Through the pride of the wicked, Is the poor inflamed, They are caught in devices that they devised.
010:003 Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul, And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath despised Jehovah.
010:004 The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth not. ‘God is not!’ are all his devices.
010:005 Pain do his ways at all times, On high are Thy judgments before him, All his adversaries-he puffeth at them.
010:006 He hath said in his heart, ‘I am not moved,’ To generation and generation not in evil.
010:007 Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue is perverseness and iniquity,
010:008 He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch secretly,
010:009 He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net.
010:010 He is bruised-he boweth down, Fallen by his mighty ones hath the afflicted.
010:011 He said in his heart, ‘God hath forgotten, He hath hid His face, He hath never seen.’
010:012 Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up Thy hand! Forget not the humble.
010:013 Wherefore hath the wicked despised God? He hath said in his heart, ‘It is not required.’
010:014 Thou hast seen, For Thou perverseness and anger beholdest; By giving into Thy hand, On Thee doth the afflicted leave it, Of the fatherless Thou hast been an helper.
010:015 Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, Seek out his wickedness, find none;
010:016 Jehovah is king to the age, and for ever, The nations have perished out of His land!
010:017 The desire of the humble Thou hast heard, O Jehovah. Thou preparest their heart; Thou causest Thine ear to attend,
010:018 To judge the fatherless and bruised: He addeth no more to oppress-man of the earth!
011:001 ¶  In Jehovah I trusted, how say ye to my soul, ‘They moved to Thy mountain for the bird?
011:002 For lo, the wicked tread a bow, They have prepared their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
011:003 When the foundations are destroyed, The righteous-what hath he done?
011:004 ‘Jehovah is in his holy temple: Jehovah-in the heavens is His throne. His eyes see-His eyelids try the sons of men.
011:005 Jehovah the righteous doth try. And the wicked and the lover of violence, Hath His soul hated,
011:006 He poureth on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, And a horrible wind is the portion of their cup.
011:007 For righteous is Jehovah, Righteousness He hath loved, The upright doth His countenance see!’
012:001 ¶  Save, Jehovah, for the saintly hath failed, For the stedfast have ceased From the sons of men:
012:002 Vanity they speak each with his neighbour, Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak.
012:003 Jehovah doth cut off all lips of flattery, A tongue speaking great things,
012:004 Who said, ‘By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?’
012:005 Because of the spoiling of the poor, Because of the groaning of the needy, Now do I arise, saith Jehovah, I set in safety him who doth breathe for it.
012:006 Sayings of Jehovah are pure sayings; Silver tried in a furnace of earth refined sevenfold.
012:007 Thou, O Jehovah, dost preserve them, Thou keepest us from this generation to the age.
012:008 Around the wicked walk continually, According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!
013:001 ¶  Till when, O Jehovah, Dost Thou forget me?-for ever? Till when dost Thou hide Thy face from me?
013:002 Till when do I set counsels in my soul? Sorrow in my heart daily? Till when is mine enemy exalted over me?
013:003 Look attentively; Answer me, O Jehovah, my God, Enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death,
013:004 Lest mine enemy say, ‘I overcame him,’ Mine adversaries joy when I am moved.
013:005 And I, in Thy kindness I have trusted, Rejoice doth my heart in Thy salvation.
013:006 I do sing to Jehovah, For He hath conferred benefits upon me!
014:001 ¶  A fool hath said in his heart, ‘God is not;’ They have done corruptly, They have done abominable actions, There is not a doer of good.
014:002 Jehovah from the heavens Hath looked on the sons of men, To see if there is a wise one-seeking God.
014:003 The whole have turned aside, Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one.
014:004 Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, Jehovah they have not called.
014:005 There they have feared a fear, For God is in the generation of the righteous.
014:006 The counsel of the poor ye cause to stink, Because Jehovah is his refuge.
014:007 ‘Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When Jehovah doth turn back To a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice-Israel is glad!
015:001 ¶  Jehovah, who doth sojourn in Thy tent? Who doth dwell in Thy holy hill?
015:002 He who is walking uprightly, And working righteousness, And speaking truth in his heart.
015:003 He hath not slandered by his tongue, He hath not done to his friend evil; And reproach he hath not lifted up Against his neighbour.
015:004 Despised in his eyes is a rejected one, And those fearing Jehovah he doth honour. He hath sworn to suffer evil, and changeth not;
015:005 His silver he hath not given in usury, And a bribe against the innocent Hath not taken; Whoso is doing these is not moved to the age!
016:001 ¶  Preserve me, O God, for I did trust in Thee.
016:002 Thou hast said to Jehovah, ‘My Lord Thou art;’ My good is not for thine own sake;
016:003 For the holy ones who are in the land, And the honourable, all my delight is in them.
016:004 Multiplied are their griefs, Who have hastened backward; I pour not out their libations of blood, Nor do I take up their names on my lips.
016:005 Jehovah is the portion of my share, and of my cup, Thou-Thou dost uphold my lot.
016:006 Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, Yea, a beauteous inheritance is for me.
016:007 I bless Jehovah who hath counselled me; Also in the nights my reins instruct me.
016:008 I did place Jehovah before me continually, Because-at my right hand I am not moved.
016:009 Therefore hath my heart been glad, And my honour doth rejoice, Also my flesh dwelleth confidently:
016:010 For Thou dost not leave my soul to Sheol, Nor givest thy saintly one to see corruption.
016:011 Thou causest me to know the path of life; Fulness of joys is with Thy presence, Pleasant things by Thy right hand for ever!
017:001 ¶  Hear, O Jehovah, righteousness, attend my cry, Give ear to my prayer, without lips of deceit.
017:002 From before thee my judgment doth go out; Thine eyes do see uprightly.
017:003 Thou hast proved my heart, Thou hast inspected by night, Thou hast tried me, Thou findest nothing; My thoughts pass not over my mouth.
017:004 As to doings of man, Through a word of Thy lips I have observed The paths of a destroyer;
017:005 To uphold my goings in Thy paths, My steps have not slidden.
017:006 I-I called Thee, for Thou dost answer me, O God, incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech.
017:007 Separate wonderfully Thy kindness, O Saviour of the confiding, By Thy right hand, from withstanders.
017:008 Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; In shadow of Thy wings thou dost hide me.
017:009 From the face of the wicked who spoiled me. Mine enemies in soul go round against me.
017:010 Their fat they have closed up, Their mouths have spoken with pride:
017:011 ‘Our steps now have compassed him;’ Their eyes they set to turn aside in the land.
017:012 His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, As a young lion dwelling in secret places.
017:013 Arise, O Jehovah, go before his face, Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Thy sword,
017:014 From men, Thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, their portion is in life, And with Thy hidden things Thou fillest their belly, They are satisfied with sons; And have left their abundance to their sucklings.
017:015 I-in righteousness, I see Thy face; I am satisfied, in awaking, with Thy form!
018:001 ¶  I love Thee, O Jehovah, my strength.
018:002 Jehovah is my rock, and my bulwark, And my deliverer, My God is my rock, I trust in Him: My shield, and a horn of my salvation, My high tower.
018:003 The ‘Praised One’ I call Jehovah, And from my enemies I am saved.
018:004 Compassed me have cords of death, And streams of the worthless make me afraid.
018:005 Cords of Sheol have surrounded me, Before me have been snares of death.
018:006 In mine adversity I call Jehovah, And unto my God I cry. He heareth from His temple my voice, And My cry before Him cometh into His ears.
018:007 And shake and tremble doth the earth, And foundations of hills are troubled, And they shake-because He hath wrath.
018:008 Gone up hath smoke by His nostrils, And fire from His mouth consumeth, Coals have been kindled by it.
018:009 And He inclineth the heavens, and cometh down, And thick darkness is under His feet.
018:010 And He rideth on a cherub, and doth fly, And He flieth on wings of wind.
018:011 He maketh darkness His secret place, Round about Him His tabernacle, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
018:012 From the brightness over-against Him His thick clouds have passed on, Hail and coals of fire.
018:013 And thunder in the heavens doth Jehovah, And the Most High giveth forth His voice, Hail and coals of fire.
018:014 And He sendeth His arrows and scattereth them, And much lightning, and crusheth them.
018:015 And seen are the streams of waters, And revealed are foundations of the earth. From Thy rebuke, O Jehovah, From the breath of the spirit of Thine anger.
018:016 He sendeth from above-He taketh me, He draweth me out of many waters.
018:017 He delivereth me from my strong enemy, And from those hating me, For they have been stronger than I.
018:018 They go before me in a day of my calamity And Jehovah is for a support to me.
018:019 And He bringeth me forth to a large place, He draweth me out, because He delighted in me.
018:020 Jehovah doth recompense me According to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands, He doth return to me.
018:021 For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not done wickedly against my God.
018:022 For all His judgments are before me, And His statutes I turn not from me.
018:023 And I am perfect with him, And I keep myself from mine iniquity.
018:024 And Jehovah doth return to me, According to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands, Over-against his eyes.
018:025 With the kind Thou showest Thyself kind, With a perfect man showest Thyself perfect.
018:026 With the pure Thou showest Thyself pure, And with the perverse showest Thyself a wrestler,
018:027 For Thou a poor people savest, And the eyes of the high causest to fall.
018:028 For Thou-Thou lightest my lamp, Jehovah my God enlighteneth my darkness.
018:029 For by Thee I run-a troop! And by my God I leap a wall.
018:030 God! perfect is His way, The saying of Jehovah is tried, A shield is He to all those trusting in Him.
018:031 For who is God besides Jehovah? And who is a rock save our God?
018:032 God! who is girding me with strength, And He maketh perfect my way.
018:033 Making my feet like hinds, And on my high places causeth me to stand.
018:034 Teaching my hands for battle, And a bow of brass was brought down by my arms.
018:035 And Thou givest to me the shield of Thy salvation, And Thy right hand doth support me, And Thy lowliness maketh me great.
018:036 Thou enlargest my step under me, And mine ankles have not slidden.
018:037 I pursue mine enemies, and overtake them, And turn back not till they are consumed.
018:038 I smite them, and they are not able to rise, They fall under my feet,
018:039 And Thou girdest me with strength for battle, Causest my withstanders to bow under me.
018:040 As to mine enemies- Thou hast given to me the neck, As to those hating me-I cut them off.
018:041 They cry, and there is no saviour, On Jehovah, and He doth not answer them.
018:042 And I beat them as dust before wind, As mire of the streets I empty them out.
018:043 Thou dost deliver me From the strivings of the people, Thou placest me for a head of nations, A people I have not known do serve me.
018:044 At the hearing of the ear they hearken to me, Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me,
018:045 Sons of a stranger fade away, And are slain out of their close places.
018:046 Jehovah liveth-and blessed is my rock, And exalted is the God of my salvation.
018:047 God-who is giving vengeance to me, And He subdueth peoples under me,
018:048 My deliverer from mine enemies, Above my withstanders Thou raisest me, From a man of violence dost deliver me.
018:049 Therefore I confess Thee among nations, O Jehovah, And to Thy name I sing praise,
018:050 Magnifying the salvation of His king, And doing kindness to His anointed, To David, and to his seed-unto the age!
019:001 ¶  The heavens are recounting the honour of God, And the work of His hands The expanse is declaring.
019:002 Day to day uttereth speech, And night to night sheweth knowledge.
019:003 There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice hath not been heard.
019:004 Into all the earth hath their line gone forth, And to the end of the world their sayings, For the sun He placed a tent in them,
019:005 And he, as a bridegroom, goeth out from his covering, He rejoiceth as a mighty one To run the path.
019:006 From the end of the heavens is his going out, And his revolution is unto their ends, And nothing is hid from his heat.
019:007 The law of Jehovah is perfect, refreshing the soul, The testimonies of Jehovah are stedfast, Making wise the simple,
019:008 The precepts of Jehovah are upright, Rejoicing the heart, The command of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes,
019:009 The fear of Jehovah is clean, standing to the age, The judgments of Jehovah are true, They have been righteous-together.
019:010 They are more desirable than gold, Yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, Even liquid honey of the comb.
019:011 Also-Thy servant is warned by them, ‘In keeping them is a great reward.’
019:012 Errors! who doth understand? From hidden ones declare me innocent,
019:013 Also-from presumptuous ones keep back Thy servant, Let them not rule over me, Then am I perfect, And declared innocent of much transgression,
019:014 Let the sayings of my mouth, And the meditation of my heart, Be for a pleasing thing before Thee, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer!
020:001 ¶  Jehovah doth answer thee, In a day of adversity, The name of the God of Jacob doth set thee on high,
020:002 He doth send thy help from the sanctuary, And from Zion doth support thee,
020:003 He doth remember all thy presents, And thy burnt-offering doth reduce to ashes. Selah.
020:004 He doth give to thee according to thy heart, And all thy counsel doth fulfil.
020:005 We sing of thy salvation, And in the name of our God set up a banner. Jehovah doth fulfil all thy requests.
020:006 Now I have known That Jehovah hath saved His anointed, He answereth him from His holy heavens, With the saving might of His right hand.
020:007 Some of chariots, and some of horses, And we of the name of Jehovah our God Make mention.
020:008 They-they have bowed and have fallen, And we have risen and station ourselves upright.
020:009 O Jehovah, save the king, He doth answer us in the day we call!
021:001 ¶  Jehovah, in Thy strength is the king joyful, In Thy salvation how greatly he rejoiceth.
021:002 The desire of his heart Thou gavest to him, And the request of his lips Thou hast not withheld. Selah.
021:003 For Thou puttest before him blessings of goodness, Thou settest on his head a crown of fine gold.
021:004 Life he hath asked from Thee, Thou hast given to him-length of days, Age-during-and for ever.
021:005 Great is his honour in Thy salvation, Honour and majesty Thou placest on him.
021:006 For Thou makest him blessings for ever, Thou dost cause him to rejoice with joy, By Thy countenance.
021:007 For the king is trusting in Jehovah, And in the kindness of the Most High He is not moved.
021:008 Thy hand cometh to all Thine enemies, Thy right hand doth find Thy haters.
021:009 Thou makest them as a furnace of fire, At the time of Thy presence. Jehovah in His anger doth swallow them, And fire doth devour them.
021:010 Their fruit from earth Thou destroyest, And their seed from the sons of men.
021:011 For they stretched out against Thee evil, They devised a wicked device, they prevail not,
021:012 For Thou makest them a butt, When Thy strings Thou preparest against their faces.
021:013 Be Thou exalted, O Jehovah in, Thy strength, We sing and we praise Thy might!
022:001 ¶  My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation, The words of my roaring?
022:002 My God, I call by day, and Thou answerest not, And by night, and there is no silence to me.
022:003 And Thou art holy, Sitting-the Praise of Israel.
022:004 In Thee did our fathers trust-they trusted, And Thou dost deliver them.
022:005 Unto Thee they cried, and were delivered, In Thee they trusted, and were not ashamed.
022:006 And I am a worm, and no man, A reproach of man, and despised of the people.
022:007 All beholding me do mock at me, They make free with the lip-shake the head,
022:008 ‘Roll unto Jehovah, He doth deliver him, He doth deliver him, for he delighted in him.’
022:009 For thou art He bringing me forth from the womb, Causing me to trust, On the breasts of my mother.
022:010 On Thee I have been cast from the womb, From the belly of my mother Thou art my God.
022:011 Be not far from me, For adversity is near, for there is no helper.
022:012 Many bulls have surrounded me, Mighty ones of Bashan have compassed me,
022:013 They have opened against me their mouth, A lion tearing and roaring.
022:014 As waters I have been poured out, And separated themselves have all my bones, My heart hath been like wax, It is melted in the midst of my bowels.
022:015 Dried up as an earthen vessel is my power, And my tongue is cleaving to my jaws.
022:016 And to the dust of death thou appointest me, For surrounded me have dogs, A company of evil doers have compassed me, Piercing my hands and my feet.
022:017 I count all my bones-they look expectingly, They look upon me,
022:018 They apportion my garments to themselves, And for my clothing they cause a lot to fall.
022:019 And Thou, O Jehovah, be not far off, O my strength, to help me haste.
022:020 Deliver from the sword my soul, From the paw of a dog mine only one.
022:021 Save me from the mouth of a lion:- And-from the horns of the high places Thou hast answered me!
022:022 I declare Thy name to my brethren, In the midst of the assembly I praise Thee.
022:023 Ye who fear Jehovah, praise ye Him, All the seed of Jacob, honour ye Him, And be afraid of Him, all ye seed of Israel.
022:024 For He hath not despised, nor abominated, The affliction of the afflicted, Nor hath He hidden His face from him, And in his crying unto Him He heareth.
022:025 Of Thee my praise is in the great assembly. My vows I complete before His fearers.
022:026 The humble do eat and are satisfied, Praise Jehovah do those seeking Him, Your heart doth live for ever.
022:027 Remember and return unto Jehovah, Do all ends of the earth, And before Thee bow themselves, Do all families of the nations,
022:028 For to Jehovah is the kingdom, And He is ruling among nations.
022:029 And the fat ones of earth have eaten, And they bow themselves, Before Him bow do all going down to dust, And he who hath not revived his soul.
022:030 A seed doth serve Him, It is declared of the Lord to the generation.
022:031 They come and declare His righteousness, To a people that is borne, that He hath made!
023:001 ¶  Jehovah is my shepherd, I do not lack,
023:002 In pastures of tender grass He causeth me to lie down, By quiet waters He doth lead me.
023:003 My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness, For His name’s sake,
023:004 Also-when I walk in a valley of death-shade, I fear no evil, for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy staff-they comfort me.
023:005 Thou arrangest before me a table, Over-against my adversaries, Thou hast anointed with oil my head, My cup is full!
023:006 Only-goodness and kindness pursue me, All the days of my life, And my dwelling is in the house of Jehovah, For a length of days!
024:001 ¶  To Jehovah is the earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.
024:002 For He on the seas hath founded it, And on the floods He doth establish it.
024:003 Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah? And who riseth up in His holy place?
024:004 The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit.
024:005 He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.
024:006 This is a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah.
024:007 Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!
024:008 Who is this-‘the king of glory?’ Jehovah-strong and mighty, Jehovah, the mighty in battle.
024:009 Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!
024:010 Who is He-this ‘king of glory?’ Jehovah of hosts-He is the king of glory! Selah.
025:001 ¶  Unto Thee, O Jehovah, my soul I lift up.
025:002 My God, in Thee I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed, Let not mine enemies exult over me.
025:003 Also let none waiting on Thee be ashamed, Let the treacherous dealers without cause be ashamed.
025:004 Thy ways, O Jehovah, cause me to know, Thy paths teach Thou me.
025:005 Cause me to tread in Thy truth, and teach me, For Thou art the God of my salvation, Near Thee I have waited all the day.
025:006 Remember Thy mercies, O Jehovah, And Thy kindnesses, for from the age are they.
025:007 Sins of my youth, and my transgressions, Do not Thou remember. According to Thy kindness be mindful of me, For Thy goodness’ sake, O Jehovah.
025:008 Good and upright is Jehovah, Therefore He directeth sinners in the way.
025:009 He causeth the humble to tread in judgment, And teacheth the humble His way.
025:010 All the paths of Jehovah are kindness and truth, To those keeping His covenant, And His testimonies.
025:011 For Thy name’s sake, O Jehovah, Thou hast pardoned mine iniquity, for it is great.
025:012 Who is this-the man fearing Jehovah? He directeth him in the way He doth choose.
025:013 His soul in good doth remain, And his seed doth possess the land.
025:014 The secret of Jehovah is for those fearing Him, And His covenant-to cause them to know.
025:015 Mine eyes are continually unto Jehovah, For He bringeth out from a net my feet.
025:016 Turn Thou unto me, and favour me, For lonely and afflicted am I.
025:017 The distresses of my heart have enlarged themselves, From my distresses bring me out.
025:018 See mine affliction and my misery, And bear with all my sins.
025:019 See my enemies, for they have been many, And with violent hatred they have hated me.
025:020 Keep my soul, and deliver me, Let me not be ashamed, for I trusted in Thee.
025:021 Integrity and uprightness do keep me, For I have waited on Thee.
025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, from all his distresses!
026:001 ¶  Judge me, O Jehovah, for I in mine integrity have walked, And in Jehovah I have trusted, I slide not.
026:002 Try me, O Jehovah, and prove me, Purified are my reins and my heart.
026:003 For Thy kindness is before mine eyes, And I have walked habitually in Thy truth.
026:004 I have not sat with vain men, And with dissemblers I enter not.
026:005 I have hated the assembly of evil doers, And with the wicked I sit not.
026:006 I wash in innocency my hands, And I compass Thine altar, O Jehovah.
026:007 To sound with a voice of confession, And to recount all Thy wonders.
026:008 Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, And the place of the tabernacle of Thine honour.
026:009 Do not gather with sinners my soul, And with men of blood my life,
026:010 In whose hand is a wicked device, And their right hand is full of bribes.
026:011 And I, in mine integrity I walk, Redeem me, and favour me.
026:012 My foot hath stood in uprightness, In assemblies I bless Jehovah!
027:001 ¶  Jehovah is my light and my salvation, Whom do I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life, Of whom am I afraid?
027:002 When evil doers come near to me to eat my flesh, My adversaries and mine enemies to me, They have stumbled and fallen.
027:003 Though a host doth encamp against me, My heart doth not fear, Though war riseth up against me, In this I am confident.
027:004 One thing I asked of Jehovah-it I seek. My dwelling in the house of Jehovah, All the days of my life, To look on the pleasantness of Jehovah, And to inquire in His temple.
027:005 For He hideth me in a tabernacle in the day of evil, He hideth me in a secret place of His tent, On a rock he raiseth me up.
027:006 And now, lifted up is my head, Above my enemies-my surrounders, And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of shouting, I sing, yea, I sing praise to Jehovah.
027:007 Hear, O Jehovah, my voice-I call, And favour me, and answer me.
027:008 To Thee said my heart ‘They sought my face, Thy face, O Jehovah, I seek.’
027:009 Hide not Thy face from me, Turn not aside in anger Thy servant, My help Thou hast been. Leave me not, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.
027:010 When my father and my mother Have forsaken me, then doth Jehovah gather me.
027:011 Shew me, O Jehovah, Thy way, And lead me in a path of uprightness, For the sake of my beholders.
027:012 Give me not to the will of my adversaries, For risen against me have false witnesses, And they breathe out violence to me.
027:013 I had not believed to look on the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living!
027:014 Look unto Jehovah-be strong, And He doth strengthen thy heart, Yea, look unto Jehovah!
028:001 ¶  Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I call, My rock, be not silent to me! Lest Thou be silent to me, And I have been compared With those going down to the pit.
028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee, In my lifting up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
028:003 Draw me not with the wicked, And with workers of iniquity, Speaking peace with their neighbours, And evil in their heart.
028:004 Give to them according to their acting, And according to the evil of their doings. According to the work of their hands give to them. Return their deed to them.
028:005 For they attend not to the doing of Jehovah, And unto the work of His hands. He throweth them down, And doth not build them up.
028:006 Blessed is Jehovah, For He hath heard the voice of my supplications.
028:007 Jehovah is my strength, and my shield, In Him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. And my heart exulteth, And with my song I thank Him.
028:008 Jehovah is strength to him, Yea, the strength of the salvation of His anointed is He.
028:009 Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance, And feed them, and carry them to the age!
029:001 ¶  Ascribe to Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.
029:002 Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.
029:003 The voice of Jehovah is on the waters, The God of glory hath thundered, Jehovah is on many waters.
029:004 The voice of Jehovah is with power, The voice of Jehovah is with majesty,
029:005 The voice of Jehovah is shivering cedars, Yea, Jehovah shivers the cedars of Lebanon.
029:006 And He causeth them to skip as a calf, Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,
029:007 The voice of Jehovah is hewing fiery flames,
029:008 The voice of Jehovah paineth a wilderness, Jehovah paineth the wilderness of Kadesh.
029:009 The voice of Jehovah paineth the oaks, And maketh bare the forests, And in His temple every one saith, ‘Glory.’
029:010 Jehovah on the deluge hath sat, And Jehovah sitteth king-to the age,
029:011 Jehovah strength to his people giveth, Jehovah blesseth His people with peace!
030:001 ¶  I exalt Thee, O Jehovah, For Thou hast drawn me up, and hast not let mine enemies rejoice over me.
030:002 Jehovah my God, I have cried to Thee, And Thou dost heal me.
030:003 Jehovah, Thou hast brought up from Sheol my soul, Thou hast kept me alive, From going down to the pit.
030:004 Sing praise to Jehovah, ye His saints, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness,
030:005 For-a moment is in His anger, Life is in His good-will, At even remaineth weeping, and at morn singing.
030:006 And I-I have said in mine ease, ‘I am not moved-to the age.
030:007 O Jehovah, in Thy good pleasure, Thou hast caused strength to remain for my mountain,’ Thou hast hidden Thy face-I have been troubled.
030:008 Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I call, And unto Jehovah I make supplication.
030:009 ‘What gain is in my blood? In my going down unto corruption? Doth dust thank Thee? doth it declare Thy truth?
030:010 Hear, O Jehovah, and favour me, O Jehovah, be a helper to me.’
030:011 Thou hast turned my mourning to dancing for me, Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, And girdest me with joy.
030:012 So that honour doth praise Thee, and is not silent, O Jehovah, my God, to the age I thank Thee!
031:001 ¶  In Thee, O Jehovah, I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed to the age, In Thy righteousness deliver me.
031:002 Incline unto me Thine ear hastily, deliver me, Be to me for a strong rock, For a house of bulwarks to save me.
031:003 For my rock and my bulwark art Thou, For Thy name’s sake lead me and tend me.
031:004 Bring me out from the net that they hid for me, For Thou art my strength.
031:005 Into Thy hand I commit my spirit, Thou hast redeemed me, Jehovah God of truth.
031:006 I have hated the observers of lying vanities, And I toward Jehovah have been confident.
031:007 I rejoice, and am glad in Thy kindness, In that Thou hast seen mine affliction, Thou hast known in adversities my soul.
031:008 And Thou hast not shut me up, Into the hand of an enemy, Thou hast caused my feet to stand in a broad place.
031:009 Favour me, O Jehovah, for distress is to me, Mine eye, my soul, and my body Have become old by provocation.
031:010 For my life hath been consumed in sorrow And my years in sighing. Feeble because of mine iniquity hath been my strength, And my bones have become old.
031:011 Among all mine adversaries I have been a reproach, And to my neighbours exceedingly, And a fear to mine acquaintances, Those seeing me without-fled from me.
031:012 I have been forgotten as dead out of mind, I have been as a perishing vessel.
031:013 For I have heard an evil account of many, Fear is round about. In their being united against me, To take my life they have devised,
031:014 And I on Thee-I have trusted, O Jehovah, I have said, ‘Thou art my God.’
031:015 In Thy hand are my times, Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, And from my pursuers.
031:016 Cause Thy face to shine on Thy servant, Save me in Thy kindness.
031:017 O Jehovah, let me not be ashamed, For I have called Thee, let the wicked be ashamed, Let them become silent to Sheol.
031:018 Let lips of falsehood become dumb, That are speaking against the righteous, Ancient sayings, in pride and contempt.
031:019 How abundant is Thy goodness, That Thou hast laid up for those fearing Thee,
031:020 Thou hast wrought for those trusting in Thee, Before sons of men. Thou hidest them in the secret place of Thy presence, From artifices of man, Thou concealest them in a tabernacle, From the strife of tongues.
031:021 Blessed is Jehovah, For He hath made marvellous His kindness To me in a city of bulwarks.
031:022 And I-I have said in my haste, ‘I have been cut off from before Thine eyes,’ But Thou hast heard the voice of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee.
031:023 Love Jehovah, all ye His saints, Jehovah is keeping the faithful, And recompensing abundantly a proud doer.
031:024 Be strong, and He strengtheneth your heart, All ye who are waiting for Jehovah!
032:001 ¶  O the happiness of him whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
032:002 O the happiness of a man, To whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
032:003 When I have kept silence, become old have my bones, Through my roaring all the day.
032:004 When by day and by night Thy hand is heavy upon me, My moisture hath been changed Into the droughts of summer. Selah.
032:005 My sin I cause Thee to know, And mine iniquity I have not covered. I have said, ‘I confess concerning My transgressions to Jehovah,’ And Thou-Thou hast taken away, The iniquity of my sin. Selah.
032:006 For this doth every saintly one pray to Thee, As the time to find. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, Unto him they come not.
032:007 Thou art a hiding-place for me, From distress Thou dost keep me, With songs of deliverance dost compass me. Selah.
032:008 I cause thee to act wisely, And direct thee in the way that thou goest, I cause mine eye to take counsel concerning thee.
032:009 Be ye not as a horse-as a mule, Without understanding, With bridle and bit, its ornaments, to curb, Not to come near unto thee.
032:010 Many are the pains of the wicked; As to him who is trusting in Jehovah, Kindness doth compass him.
032:011 Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous, And sing, all ye upright of heart!
033:001 ¶  Sing, ye righteous, in Jehovah, For upright ones praise is comely.
033:002 Give ye thanks to Jehovah with a harp, With psaltery of ten strings sing praise to Him,
033:003 Sing ye to Him a new song, Play skilfully with shouting.
033:004 For upright is the word of Jehovah, And all His work is in faithfulness.
033:005 Loving righteousness and judgment, Of the kindness of Jehovah is the earth full.
033:006 By the word of Jehovah The heavens have been made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host.
033:007 Gathering as a heap the waters of the sea, Putting in treasuries the depths.
033:008 Afraid of Jehovah are all the earth, Of Him are all the inhabitants of the world afraid.
033:009 For He hath said, and it is, He hath commanded, and it standeth.
033:010 Jehovah made void the counsel of nations, He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples.
033:011 The counsel of Jehovah to the age standeth, The thoughts of His heart to all generations.
033:012 O the happiness of the nation whose God is Jehovah, Of the people He did choose, For an inheritance to Him.
033:013 From the heavens hath Jehovah looked, He hath seen all the sons of men.
033:014 From the fixed place of His dwelling, He looked unto all inhabitants of the earth;
033:015 Who is forming their hearts together, Who is attending unto all their works.
033:016 The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, By abundance of power.
033:017 A false thing is the horse for safety, And by the abundance of his strength He doth not deliver.
033:018 Lo, the eye of Jehovah is to those fearing Him, To those waiting for His kindness,
033:019 To deliver from death their soul, And to keep them alive in famine.
033:020 Our soul hath waited for Jehovah, Our help and our shield is He,
033:021 For in Him doth our heart rejoice, For in His holy name we have trusted.
033:022 Let Thy kindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, As we have waited for Thee!
034:001 ¶  I do bless Jehovah at all times, Continually His praise is in my mouth.
034:002 In Jehovah doth my soul boast herself, Hear do the humble and rejoice.
034:003 Ascribe ye greatness to Jehovah with me, And we exalt His name together.
034:004 I sought Jehovah, and He answered me, And from all my fears did deliver me.
034:005 They looked expectingly unto Him, And they became bright, And their faces are not ashamed.
034:006 This poor one called, and Jehovah heard, And from all his distresses saved him.
034:007 A messenger of Jehovah is encamping, Round about those who fear Him, And He armeth them.
034:008 Taste ye and see that Jehovah is good, O the happiness of the man who trusteth in Him.
034:009 Fear Jehovah, ye His holy ones, For there is no lack to those fearing Him.
034:010 Young lions have lacked and been hungry, And those seeking Jehovah lack not any good,
034:011 Come ye, children, hearken to me, The fear of Jehovah I do teach you.
034:012 Who is the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good?
034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking deceit.
034:014 Turn aside from evil and do good, Seek peace and pursue it.
034:015 The eyes of Jehovah are unto the righteous, And His ears unto their cry.
034:016 (The face of Jehovah is on doers of evil, To cut off from earth their memorial.)
034:017 They cried, and Jehovah heard, And from all their distresses delivered them.
034:018 Near is Jehovah to the broken of heart, And the bruised of spirit He saveth.
034:019 Many are the evils of the righteous, Out of them all doth Jehovah deliver him.
034:020 He is keeping all his bones, One of them hath not been broken.
034:021 Evil doth put to death the wicked, And those hating the righteous are desolate.
034:022 Jehovah redeemeth the soul of His servants, And none trusting in Him are desolate!
035:001 ¶  Strive, Jehovah, with my strivers, fight with my fighters,
035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help,
035:003 And draw out spear and lance, To meet my pursuers. Say to my soul, ‘Thy salvation I am.’
035:004 They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, Turned backward and confounded, Those devising my evil.
035:005 They are as chaff before wind, And a messenger of Jehovah driving away.
035:006 Their way is darkness and slipperiness, And a messenger of Jehovah their pursuer.
035:007 For without cause they hid for me their netpit, Without cause they digged for my soul.
035:008 Meet him doth desolation-he knoweth not, And his net that he hid catcheth him, For desolation he falleth into it.
035:009 And my soul is joyful in Jehovah, It rejoiceth in His salvation.
035:010 All my bones say, ‘Jehovah, who is like Thee, Delivering the poor from the stronger than he, And the poor and needy from his plunderer.’
035:011 Violent witnesses rise up, That which I have not known they ask me.
035:012 They pay me evil for good, bereaving my soul,
035:013 And I-in their sickness my clothing is sackcloth, I have humbled with fastings my soul, And my prayer unto my bosom returneth.
035:014 As if a friend, as if my brother, I walked habitually, As a mourner for a mother, Mourning I have bowed down.
035:015 And-in my halting they have rejoiced, And have been gathered together, Gathered against me were the smiters, And I have not known, They have rent, and they have not ceased;
035:016 With profane ones, mockers in feasts, Gnashing against me their teeth.
035:017 Lord, how long dost thou behold? Keep back my soul from their desolations, From young lions my only one.
035:018 I thank Thee in a great assembly, Among a mighty people I praise Thee.
035:019 Mine enemies rejoice not over me with falsehood, Those hating me without cause wink the eye.
035:020 For they speak not peace, And against the quiet of the land, Deceitful words they devise,
035:021 And they enlarge against me their mouth, They said, ‘Aha, aha, our eye hath seen.’
035:022 Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, Be not silent, O Lord-be not far from me,
035:023 Stir up, and wake to my judgment, My God, and my Lord, to my plea.
035:024 Judge me according to Thy righteousness, O Jehovah my God, And they do not rejoice over me.
035:025 They do not say in their heart, ‘Aha, our desire.’ They do not say, ‘We swallowed him up.’
035:026 They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, Who are magnifying themselves against me.
035:027 They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, And they say continually, ‘Jehovah is magnified, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.’
035:028 And my tongue uttereth Thy righteousness, All the day Thy praise!
036:001 ¶  The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within my heart, ‘Fear of God is not before his eyes,
036:002 For he made it smooth to himself in his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated.
036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit, He ceased to act prudently-to do good.
036:004 Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he doth not refuse.’
036:005 O Jehovah, in the heavens is Thy kindness, Thy faithfulness is unto the clouds.
036:006 Thy righteousness is as mountains of God, Thy judgments are a great deep. Man and beast Thou savest, O Jehovah.
036:007 How precious is Thy kindness, O God, And the sons of men In the shadow of Thy wings do trust.
036:008 They are filled from the fatness of Thy house, And the stream of Thy delights Thou dost cause them to drink.
036:009 For with Thee is a fountain of life, In Thy light we see light.
036:010 Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright of heart.
036:011 Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a hand of the wicked let not move me.
036:012 There have workers of iniquity fallen, They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!
037:001 ¶  Do not fret because of evil doers, Be not envious against doers of iniquity,
037:002 For as grass speedily they are cut off, And as the greenness of the tender grass do fade.
037:003 Trust in Jehovah, and do good, Dwell in the land, and enjoy faithfulness,
037:004 And delight thyself on Jehovah, And He giveth to thee the petitions of thy heart.
037:005 Roll on Jehovah thy way, And trust upon Him, and He worketh,
037:006 And hath brought out as light thy righteousness, And thy judgment as noon-day.
037:007 Be silent for Jehovah, and stay thyself for Him, Do not fret because of him Who is making prosperous his way, Because of a man doing wicked devices.
037:008 Desist from anger, and forsake fury, Fret not thyself only to do evil.
037:009 For evil doers are cut off, As to those waiting on Jehovah, they possess the land.
037:010 And yet a little, and the wicked is not, And thou hast considered his place, and it is not.
037:011 And the humble do possess the land, And they have delighted themselves In the abundance of peace.
037:012 The wicked is devising against the righteous, And gnashing against him his teeth.
037:013 The Lord doth laugh at him, For He hath seen that his day cometh.
037:014 A sword have the wicked opened, And they have trodden their bow, To cause to fall the poor and needy, To slaughter the upright of the way.
037:015 Their sword doth enter into their own heart, And their bows are shivered.
037:016 Better is the little of the righteous, Than the store of many wicked.
037:017 For the arms of the wicked are shivered, And Jehovah is sustaining the righteous.
037:018 Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect, And their inheritance is-to the age.
037:019 They are not ashamed in a time of evil, And in days of famine they are satisfied.
037:020 But the wicked perish, and the enemies of Jehovah, As the preciousness of lambs, Have been consumed, In smoke they have been consumed.
037:021 The wicked is borrowing and repayeth not, And the righteous is gracious and giving.
037:022 For His blessed ones do possess the land, And His reviled ones are cut off.
037:023 From Jehovah are the steps of a man, They have been prepared, And his way he desireth.
037:024 When he falleth, he is not cast down, For Jehovah is sustaining his hand.
037:025 Young I have been, I have also become old, And I have not seen the righteous forsaken, And his seed seeking bread.
037:026 All the day he is gracious and lending, And his seed is for a blessing.
037:027 Turn aside from evil, and do good, and dwell to the age.
037:028 For Jehovah is loving judgment, And He doth not forsake His saintly ones, To the age they have been kept, And the seed of the wicked is cut off.
037:029 The righteous possess the land, And they dwell for ever on it.
037:030 The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And his tongue speaketh judgment.
037:031 The law of his God is his heart, His steps do not slide.
037:032 The wicked is watching for the righteous, And is seeking to put him to death.
037:033 Jehovah doth not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him in his being judged.
037:034 Look unto Jehovah, and keep His way, And He doth exalt thee to possess the land, In the wicked being cut off-thou seest!
037:035 I have seen the wicked terrible, And spreading as a green native plant,
037:036 And he passeth away, and lo, he is not, And I seek him, and he is not found!
037:037 Observe the perfect, and see the upright, For the latter end of each is peace.
037:038 And transgressors were destroyed together, The latter end of the wicked was cut off.
037:039 And the salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah, Their strong place in a time of adversity.
037:040 And Jehovah doth help them and deliver them, He delivereth them from the wicked, And saveth them, Because they trusted in Him!
038:001 ¶  Jehovah, in Thy wrath reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me.
038:002 For Thine arrows have come down on me, And Thou lettest down upon me Thy hand.
038:003 Soundness is not in my flesh, Because of Thine indignation, Peace is not in my bones because of my sin.
038:004 For mine iniquities have passed over my head, As a heavy burden-too heavy for me.
038:005 Stunk-become corrupt have my wounds, Because of my folly.
038:006 I have been bent down, I have been bowed down-unto excess, All the day I have gone mourning.
038:007 For my flanks have been full of drought, And soundness is not in my flesh.
038:008 I have been feeble and smitten-unto excess, I have roared from disquietude of heart.
038:009 Lord, before Thee is all my desire, And my sighing from Thee hath not been hid.
038:010 My heart is panting, my power hath forsaken me, And the light of mine eyes, Even they are not with me.
038:011 My lovers and my friends over-against my plague stand. And my neighbours afar off have stood.
038:012 And those seeking my soul lay a snare, And those seeking my evil Have spoken mischievous things, And they do deceits meditate all the day.
038:013 And I, as deaf, hear not. And as a dumb one who openeth not his mouth.
038:014 Yea, I am as a man who heareth not, And in his mouth are no reproofs.
038:015 Because for Thee, O Jehovah, I have waited, Thou dost answer, O Lord my God.
038:016 When I said, ‘Lest they rejoice over me, In the slipping of my foot against me they magnified themselves.
038:017 For I am ready to halt, And my pain is before me continually.
038:018 For mine iniquity I declare, I am sorry for my sin.
038:019 And mine enemies are lively, They have been strong, and those hating me without cause, Have been multiplied.
038:020 And those paying evil for good accuse me, Because of my pursuing good.
038:021 Do not forsake me, O Jehovah, My God, be not far from me,
038:022 Haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
039:001 ¶  I have said, ‘I observe my ways, Against sinning with my tongue, I keep for my mouth a curb, while the wicked is before me.’
039:002 I was dumb with silence, I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited.
039:003 Hot is my heart within me, In my meditating doth the fire burn, I have spoken with my tongue.
039:004 ‘Cause me to know, O Jehovah, mine end, And the measure of my days-what it is,’ I know how frail I am.
039:005 Lo, handbreadths Thou hast made my days, And mine age is as nothing before Thee, Only, all vanity is every man set up. Selah.
039:006 Only, in an image doth each walk habitually, Only, in vain, they are disquieted, He heapeth up and knoweth not who gathereth them.
039:007 And, now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope-it is of Thee.
039:008 From all my transgressions deliver me, A reproach of the fool make me not.
039:009 I have been dumb, I open not my mouth, Because Thou-Thou hast done it.
039:010 Turn aside from off me Thy stroke, From the striving of Thy hand I have been consumed.
039:011 With reproofs against iniquity, Thou hast corrected man, And dost waste as a moth his desirableness, Only, vanity is every man. Selah.
039:012 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And to my cry give ear, Unto my tear be not silent, For a sojourner I am with Thee, A settler like all my fathers.
039:013 Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!
040:001 ¶  I have diligently expected Jehovah, And He inclineth to me, and heareth my cry,
040:002 And He doth cause me to come up From a pit of desolation-from mire of mud, And He raiseth up on a rock my feet, He is establishing my steps.
040:003 And He putteth in my mouth a new song, ‘Praise to our God.’ Many do see and fear, and trust in Jehovah.
040:004 O the happiness of the man Who hath made Jehovah his trust, And hath not turned unto the proud, And those turning aside to lies.
040:005 Much hast Thou done, Jehovah my God; Thy wonders and Thy thoughts toward us, There is none to arrange unto Thee, I declare and speak: They have been more than to be numbered.
040:006 Sacrifice and present Thou hast not desired, Ears Thou hast prepared for me, Burnt and sin-offering Thou hast not asked.
040:007 Then said I, ‘Lo, I have come,’ In the roll of the book it is written of me,
040:008 To do Thy pleasure, my God, I have delighted, And Thy law is within my heart.
040:009 I have proclaimed tidings of righteousness In the great assembly, lo, my lips I restrain not, O Jehovah, Thou hast known.
040:010 Thy righteousness I have not concealed In the midst of my heart, Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation I have told, I have not hidden Thy kindness and Thy truth, To the great assembly.
040:011 Thou, O Jehovah, restrainest not Thy mercies from me, Thy kindness and Thy truth do continually keep me.
040:012 For compassed me have evils innumerable, Overtaken me have mine iniquities, And I have not been able to see; They have been more than the hairs of my head, And my heart hath forsaken me.
040:013 Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me, O Jehovah, for my help make haste.
040:014 They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are seeking my soul to destroy it, They are turned backward, And are ashamed, who are desiring my evil.
040:015 They are desolate because of their shame, Who are saying to me, ‘Aha, aha.’
040:016 All seeking Thee rejoice and are glad in Thee, Those loving Thy salvation say continually, ‘Jehovah is magnified.’
040:017 And I am poor and needy, The Lord doth devise for me. My help and my deliverer art Thou, O my God, tarry Thou not.
041:001 ¶  O the happiness of him Who is acting wisely unto the poor, In a day of evil doth Jehovah deliver him.
041:002 Jehovah doth preserve him and revive him, He is happy in the land, And Thou givest him not into the will of his enemies.
041:003 Jehovah supporteth on a couch of sickness, All his bed Thou hast turned in his weakness.
041:004 I-I said, ‘O Jehovah, favour me, Heal my soul, for I did sin against Thee,’
041:005 Mine enemies say evil of me: When he dieth-his name hath perished!
041:006 And if he came to see-vanity he speaketh, His heart gathereth iniquity to itself, He goeth out-at the street he speaketh.
041:007 All hating me whisper together against me, Against me they devise evil to me:
041:008 A thing of Belial is poured out on him, And because he lay down he riseth not again.
041:009 Even mine ally, in whom I trusted, One eating my bread, made great the heel against me,
041:010 And Thou, Jehovah, favour me, And cause me to rise, And I give recompence to them.
041:011 By this I have known, That Thou hast delighted in me, Because my enemy shouteth not over me.
041:012 As to me, in mine integrity, Thou hast taken hold upon me, And causest me to stand before Thee to the age.
041:013 Blessed is Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age-and unto the age. Amen and Amen.
042:001 ¶  As a hart doth pant for streams of water, So my soul panteth toward Thee, O God.
042:002 My soul thirsted for God, for the living God, When do I enter and see the face of God?
042:003 My tear hath been to me bread day and night, In their saying unto me all the day, ‘Where is thy God?’
042:004 These I remember, and pour out my soul in me, For I pass over into the booth, I go softly with them unto the house of God, With the voice of singing and confession, The multitude keeping feast!
042:005 What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? Yea, art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him: The salvation of my countenance-My God!
042:006 In me doth my soul bow itself, Therefore I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, And of the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.
042:007 Deep unto deep is calling At the noise of Thy water-spouts, All Thy breakers and Thy billows passed over me.
042:008 By day Jehovah commandeth His kindness, And by night a song is with me, A prayer to the God of my life.
042:009 I say to God my rock, ‘Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning in the oppression of an enemy?
042:010 With a sword in my bones Have mine adversaries reproached me, In their saying unto me all the day, ‘Where is thy God?’
042:011 What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? And what! art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!
043:001 ¶  Judge me, O God, And plead my cause against a nation not pious, From a man of deceit and perverseness Thou dost deliver me,
043:002 For thou art the God of my strength. Why hast Thou cast me off? Why mourning do I go up and down, In the oppression of an enemy?
043:003 Send forth Thy light and Thy truth, They-they lead me, they bring me in, Unto Thy holy hill, and unto Thy tabernacles.
043:004 And I go in unto the altar of God, Unto God, the joy of my rejoicing. And I thank Thee with a harp, O God, my God.
043:005 What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? And what! art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!
044:001 ¶  O God, with our ears we have heard, Our fathers have recounted to us, The work Thou didst work in their days, In the days of old.
044:002 Thou, with Thy hand, nations hast dispossessed. And Thou dost plant them. Thou afflictest peoples, and sendest them away.
044:003 For, not by their sword Possessed they the land, And their arm gave not salvation to them, But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, And the light of Thy countenance, Because Thou hadst accepted them.
044:004 Thou art He, my king, O God, Command the deliverances of Jacob.
044:005 By Thee our adversaries we do push, By Thy name tread down our withstanders,
044:006 For, not in my bow do I trust, And my sword doth not save me.
044:007 For Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And those hating us Thou hast put to shame.
044:008 In God we have boasted all the day, And Thy name to the age we thank. Selah.
044:009 In anger Thou hast cast off and causest us to blush, And goest not forth with our hosts.
044:010 Thou causest us to turn backward from an adversary, And those hating us, Have spoiled for themselves.
044:011 Thou makest us food like sheep, And among nations Thou hast scattered us.
044:012 Thou sellest Thy people-without wealth, And hast not become great by their price.
044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a reproach to our surrounders.
044:014 Thou makest us a simile among nations, A shaking of the head among peoples.
044:015 All the day my confusion is before me, And the shame of my face hath covered me.
044:016 Because of the voice of a reproacher and reviler, Because of an enemy and a self-avenger.
044:017 All this met us, and we did not forget Thee, Nor have we dealt falsely in Thy covenant.
044:018 We turn not backward our heart, Nor turn aside doth our step from Thy path.
044:019 But Thou hast smitten us in a place of dragons, And dost cover us over with death-shade.
044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, And spread our hands to a strange God,
044:021 Doth not God search out this? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart.
044:022 Surely, for Thy sake we have been slain all the day, Reckoned as sheep of the slaughter.
044:023 Stir up-why dost Thou sleep, O Lord? Awake, cast us not off for ever.
044:024 Why Thy face hidest Thou? Thou forgettest our afflictions and our oppression,
044:025 For bowed to the dust hath our soul, Cleaved to the earth hath our belly.
044:026 Arise, a help to us, And ransom us for thy kindness’ sake.
045:001 ¶  My heart hath indited a good thing, I am telling my works to a king, My tongue is the pen of a speedy writer.
045:002 Thou hast been beautified above the sons of men, Grace hath been poured into thy lips, Therefore hath God blessed thee to the age.
045:003 Gird Thy sword upon the thigh, O mighty, Thy glory and Thy majesty!
045:004 As to Thy majesty-prosper!-ride! Because of truth, and meekness-righteousness, And Thy right hand showeth Thee fearful things.
045:005 Thine arrows are sharp, -Peoples fall under Thee- In the heart of the enemies of the king.
045:006 Thy throne, O God, is age-during, and for ever, A sceptre of uprightness Is the sceptre of Thy kingdom.
045:007 Thou hast loved righteousness and hatest wickedness, Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee, Oil of joy above thy companions.
045:008 Myrrh and aloes, cassia! all thy garments, Out of palaces of ivory Stringed instruments have made thee glad.
045:009 Daughters of kings are among thy precious ones, A queen hath stood at thy right hand, In pure gold of Ophir.
045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and see, incline thine ear, And forget thy people, and thy father’s house,
045:011 And the king doth desire thy beauty, Because he is thy lord-bow thyself to him,
045:012 And the daughter of Tyre with a present, The rich of the people do appease thy face.
045:013 All glory is the daughter of the king within, Of gold-embroidered work is her clothing.
045:014 In divers colours she is brought to the king, Virgins-after her-her companions, Are brought to thee.
045:015 They are brought with joy and gladness, They come into the palace of the king.
045:016 Instead of thy fathers are thy sons, Thou dost appoint them for princes in all the earth.
045:017 I make mention of Thy name in all generations, Therefore do peoples praise Thee, To the age, and for ever!
046:001 ¶  God is to us a refuge and strength, A help in adversities found most surely.
046:002 Therefore we fear not in the changing of earth, And in the slipping of mountains Into the heart of the seas.
046:003 Roar-troubled are its waters, Mountains they shake in its pride. Selah.
046:004 A river-its rivulets rejoice the city of God, Thy holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
046:005 God is in her midst-she is not moved, God doth help her at the turn of the morn!
046:006 Troubled have been nations, Moved have been kingdoms, He hath given forth with His voice, earth melteth.
046:007 Jehovah of Hosts is with us, A tower for us is the God of Jacob. Selah.
046:008 Come ye, see the works of Jehovah, Who hath done astonishing things in the earth,
046:009 Causing wars to cease, Unto the end of the earth, the bow he shivereth, And the spear He hath cut asunder, Chariots he doth burn with fire.
046:010 Desist, and know that I am God, I am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth.
046:011 Jehovah of hosts is with us, A tower for us is the God of Jacob! Selah.
047:001 ¶  All ye peoples, clap the hand, Shout to God with a voice of singing,
047:002 For Jehovah Most High is fearful, A great king over all the earth.
047:003 He leadeth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
047:004 He doth choose for us our inheritance, The excellency of Jacob that He loves. Selah.
047:005 God hath gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.
047:006 Praise God-praise-give praise to our king, praise.
047:007 For king of all the earth is God, Give praise, O understanding one.
047:008 God hath reigned over nations, God hath sat on His holy throne,
047:009 Nobles of peoples have been gathered, With the people of the God of Abraham, For to God are the shields of earth, Greatly hath He been exalted!
048:001 ¶  Great is Jehovah, and praised greatly, In the city of our God-His holy hill.
048:002 Beautiful for elevation, A joy of all the land, is Mount Zion, The sides of the north, the city of a great king.
048:003 God in her high places is known for a tower.
048:004 For, lo, the kings met, they passed by together,
048:005 They have seen-so they have marvelled, They have been troubled, they were hastened away.
048:006 Trembling hath seized them there, Pain, as of a travailing woman.
048:007 By an east wind Thou shiverest ships of Tarshish.
048:008 As we have heard, so we have seen, In the city of Jehovah of hosts, In the city of our God, God doth establish her-to the age. Selah.
048:009 We have thought, O God, of Thy kindness, In the midst of Thy temple,
048:010 As is Thy name, O God, so is Thy praise, Over the ends of the earth, Righteousness hath filled Thy right hand.
048:011 Rejoice doth Mount Zion, The daughters of Judah are joyful, For the sake of Thy judgments.
048:012 Compass Zion, and go round her, count her towers,
048:013 Set your heart to her bulwark, Consider her high places, So that ye recount to a later generation,
048:014 That this God is our God- To the age and for ever, He-he doth lead us over death!
049:001 ¶  Hear this, all ye peoples, Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.
049:002 Both low and high, together rich and needy.
049:003 My mouth speaketh wise things, And the meditations of my heart are things of understanding.
049:004 I incline to a simile mine ear, I open with a harp my riddle:
049:005 Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my supplanters doth compass me.
049:006 Those trusting on their wealth, And in the multitude of their riches, Do shew themselves foolish.
049:007 A brother doth no one at all ransom, He doth not give to God his atonement.
049:008 And precious is the redemption of their soul, And it hath ceased-to the age.
049:009 And still he liveth for ever, He seeth not the pit.
049:010 For he seeth wise men die, Together the foolish and brutish perish, And have left to others their wealth.
049:011 Their heart is: Their houses are to the age, Their tabernacles to all generations. They proclaimed their names over the lands.
049:012 And man in honour doth not remain, He hath been like the beasts, they have been cut off.
049:013 This their way is folly for them, And their posterity with their sayings are pleased. Selah.
049:014 As sheep for Sheol they have set themselves, Death doth afflict them, And the upright rule over them in the morning, And their form is for consumption. Sheol is a dwelling for him.
049:015 Only, God doth ransom my soul from the hand of Sheol, For He doth receive me. Selah.
049:016 Fear not, when one maketh wealth, When the honour of his house is abundant,
049:017 For at his death he receiveth nothing, His honour goeth not down after him.
049:018 For his soul in his life he blesseth, (And they praise thee when thou dost well for thyself.)
049:019 It cometh to the generation of his fathers, For ever they see not the light.
049:020 Man in honour, who understandest not, Hath been like the beasts, they have been cut off!
050:001 ¶  The God of gods-Jehovah-hath spoken, And He calleth to the earth From the rising of the sun unto its going in.
050:002 From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shone.
050:003 Our God cometh, and is not silent, Fire before Him doth devour, And round about him it hath been very tempestuous.
050:004 He doth call unto the heavens from above, And unto the earth, to judge His people.
050:005 Gather ye to Me My saints, Making covenant with Me over a sacrifice.
050:006 And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself is judge. Selah.
050:007 Hear, O My people, and I speak, O Israel, and I testify against thee, God, thy God am I.
050:008 Not for thy sacrifices do I reprove thee, Yea, thy burnt-offerings Are before Me continually.
050:009 I take not from thy house a bullock, From thy folds he goats.
050:010 For Mine is every beast of the forest, The cattle on the hills of oxen.
050:011 I have known every fowl of the mountains, And the wild beast of the field is with Me.
050:012 If I am hungry I tell not to thee, For Mine is the world and its fulness.
050:013 Do I eat the flesh of bulls, And drink the blood of he-goats?
050:014 Sacrifice to God confession, And complete to the Most High thy vows.
050:015 And call Me in a day of adversity, I deliver thee, and thou honourest Me.
050:016 And to the wicked hath God said: What to thee-to recount My statutes? That thou liftest up My covenant on thy mouth?
050:017 Yea, thou hast hated instruction, And dost cast My words behind thee.
050:018 If thou hast seen a thief, Then thou art pleased with him, And with adulterers is thy portion.
050:019 Thy mouth thou hast sent forth with evil, And thy tongue joineth deceit together,
050:020 Thou sittest, against thy brother thou speakest, Against a son of thy mother givest slander.
050:021 These thou didst, and I kept silent, Thou hast thought that I am like thee, I reprove thee, and set in array before thine eyes.
050:022 Understand this, I pray you, Ye who are forgetting God, Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer.
050:023 He who is sacrificing praise honoureth Me, As to him who maketh a way, I cause him to look on the salvation of God!
051:001 ¶  Favour me, O God, according to Thy kindness, According to the abundance of Thy mercies, Blot out my transgressions.
051:002 Thoroughly wash me from mine iniquity, And from my sin cleanse me,
051:003 For my transgressions I do know, And my sin is before me continually.
051:004 Against Thee, Thee only, I have sinned, And done the evil thing in Thine eyes, So that Thou art righteous in Thy words, Thou art pure in Thy judging.
051:005 Lo, in iniquity I have been brought forth, And in sin doth my mother conceive me.
051:006 Lo, truth Thou hast desired in the inward parts, And in the hidden part Wisdom Thou causest me to know.
051:007 Thou cleansest me with hyssop and I am clean, Washest me, and than snow I am whiter.
051:008 Thou causest me to hear joy and gladness, Thou makest joyful bones Thou hast bruised.
051:009 Hide Thy face from my sin. And all mine iniquities blot out.
051:010 A clean heart prepare for me, O God, And a right spirit renew within me.
051:011 Cast me not forth from Thy presence, And Thy Holy Spirit take not from me.
051:012 Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, And a willing spirit doth sustain me.
051:013 I teach transgressors Thy ways, And sinners unto Thee do return.
051:014 Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, My tongue singeth of Thy righteousness.
051:015 O Lord, my lips thou dost open, And my mouth declareth Thy praise.
051:016 For Thou desirest not sacrifice, or I give it, Burnt-offering Thou acceptest not.
051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, A heart broken and bruised, O God, Thou dost not despise.
051:018 Do good in Thy good pleasure with Zion, Thou dost build the walls of Jerusalem.
051:019 Then Thou desirest sacrifices of righteousness, Burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering, Then they offer bullocks on thine altar!
052:001 ¶  What, boasteth thou in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God is all the day.
052:002 Mischiefs doth thy tongue devise, Like a sharp razor, working deceit.
052:003 Thou hast loved evil rather than good, Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah.
052:004 Thou hast loved all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
052:005 Also-God doth break thee down for ever, Taketh thee, and pulleth thee out of the tent, And He hath uprooted thee Out of the land of the living. Selah.
052:006 And the righteous see, And fear, and laugh at him.
052:007 ‘Lo, the man who maketh not God his strong place, And trusteth in the abundance of his riches, He is strong in his mischiefs.’
052:008 And I, as a green olive in the house of God, I have trusted in the kindness of God, To the age and for ever,
052:009 I thank Thee to the age, because Thou hast done it, And I wait on Thy name for it is good before Thy saints!
053:001 ¶  A fool said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ They have done corruptly, Yea, they have done abominable iniquity, There is none doing good.
053:002 God from the heavens looked on the sons of men, To see if there be an understanding one, One seeking God.
053:003 Every one went back, together they became filthy, There is none doing good-not even one.
053:004 Have not workers of iniquity known, Those eating my people have eaten bread, God they have not called.
053:005 There they feared a fear-there was no fear, For God hath scattered the bones of him Who is encamping against thee, Thou hast put to shame, For God hath despised them.
053:006 Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God turneth back to a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice-Israel is glad!
054:001 ¶  O God, by Thy name save me, and by Thy might judge me.
054:002 O God, hear my prayer, Give ear to the sayings of my mouth,
054:003 For strangers have risen up against me And terrible ones have sought my soul, They have not set God before them. Selah.
054:004 Lo, God is a helper to me, The Lord is with those supporting my soul,
054:005 Turn back doth the evil thing to mine enemies, In Thy truth cut them off.
054:006 With a free will-offering I sacrifice to Thee, I thank Thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good,
054:007 For, from all adversity He delivered me, And on mine enemies hath mine eye looked!
055:001 ¶  Give ear, O God, to my prayer, And hide not from my supplication.
055:002 Attend to me, and answer me, I mourn in my meditation, and make a noise,
055:003 Because of the voice of an enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked, For they cause sorrow to move against me, And in anger they hate me.
055:004 My heart is pained within me, And terrors of death have fallen on me.
055:005 Fear and trembling come in to me, And horror doth cover me.
055:006 And I say, ‘Who doth give to me a pinion as a dove? I fly away and rest,
055:007 Lo, I move far off, I lodge in a wilderness. Selah.
055:008 I hasten escape for myself, From a rushing wind, from a whirlwind.
055:009 Swallow up, O Lord, divide their tongue, For I saw violence and strife in a city.
055:010 By day and by night they go round it, on its walls. Both iniquity and perverseness are in its midst,
055:011 Mischiefs are in its midst. Fraud and deceit depart not from its street.
055:012 For an enemy reproacheth me not, or I bear it, He who is hating me Hath not magnified himself against me, Or I hide from him.
055:013 But thou, a man-as mine equal, My familiar friend, and mine acquaintance.
055:014 When together we sweeten counsel, Into the house of God we walk in company.
055:015 Desolations are upon them, They go down to Sheol-alive, For wickedness is in their dwelling, in their midst.
055:016 I-to God I call, and Jehovah saveth me.
055:017 Evening, and morning, and noon, I meditate, and make a noise, and He heareth my voice,
055:018 He hath ransomed in peace my soul From him who is near to me, For with the multitude they were with me.
055:019 God doth hear and afflict them, And He sitteth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, and fear not God,
055:020 He hath sent forth his hands against his well-wishers, He hath polluted his covenant.
055:021 Sweeter than honey hath been his mouth, And his heart is war! Softer have been his words than oil, And they are drawn swords.
055:022 Cast on Jehovah that which He hath given thee, And He doth sustain thee, He doth not suffer for ever the moving of the righteous.
055:023 And Thou, O God, dost bring them down To a pit of destruction, Men of blood and deceit reach not to half their days, And I-I do trust in Thee!
056:001 ¶  Favour me, O God, for man swallowed me up, All the day fighting he oppresseth me,
056:002 Mine enemies have swallowed up all the day, For many are fighting against me, O most High,
056:003 The day I am afraid I am confident toward Thee.
056:004 In God I praise His word, in God I have trusted, I fear not what flesh doth to me.
056:005 All the day they wrest my words, Concerning me all their thoughts are for evil,
056:006 They assemble, they hide, they watch my heels, When they have expected my soul.
056:007 By iniquity they escape, In anger the peoples put down, O God.
056:008 My wandering Thou hast counted, Thou-place Thou my tear in Thy bottle, Are they not in Thy book?
056:009 Then turn back do mine enemies in the day I call. This I have known, that God is for me.
056:010 In God I praise the word, In Jehovah I praise the word.
056:011 In God I trusted, I fear not what man doth to me,
056:012 On me, O God, are Thy vows, I repay thank-offerings to Thee.
056:013 For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, Dost Thou not my feet from falling? To walk habitually before God in the light of the living!
057:001 ¶  Favour me, O God, favour me, For in Thee is my soul trusting, And in the shadow of Thy wings I trust, Until the calamities pass over.
057:002 I call to God Most High, To God who is perfecting for me.
057:003 He sendeth from the heaven, and saveth me, He reproached-who is panting after me. Selah. God sendeth forth His kindness and His truth.
057:004 My soul is in the midst of lions, I lie down among flames-sons of men, Their teeth are a spear and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
057:005 Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, Above all the earth Thine honour.
057:006 A net they have prepared for my steps, Bowed down hath my soul, They have digged before me a pit, They have fallen into its midst. Selah.
057:007 Prepared is my heart, O God, Prepared is my heart, I sing and praise.
057:008 Awake, mine honour, awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the morning dawn.
057:009 I thank Thee among the peoples, O Lord, I praise Thee among the nations.
057:010 For great unto the heavens is Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.
057:011 Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God. Above all the earth Thine honour!
058:001 ¶  Is it true, O dumb one, righteously ye speak? Uprightly ye judge, O sons of men?
058:002 Even in heart ye work iniquities, In the land the violence of your hands ye ponder.
058:003 The wicked have been estranged from the womb, They have erred from the belly, speaking lies.
058:004 Their poison is as poison of a serpent, As a deaf asp shutting its ear,
058:005 Which hearkeneth not to the voice of whisperers, A charmer of charms most skilful.
058:006 O God, break their teeth in their mouth, The jaw-teeth of young lions break down, O Jehovah.
058:007 They are melted as waters, They go up and down for themselves, His arrow proceedeth as they cut themselves off.
058:008 As a snail that melteth he goeth on, As an untimely birth of a woman, They have not seen the sun.
058:009 Before your pots discern the bramble, As well the raw as the heated He whirleth away.
058:010 The righteous rejoiceth that he hath seen vengeance, His steps he washeth in the blood of the wicked.
058:011 And man saith: ‘Surely fruit is for the righteous: Surely there is a God judging in the earth!’
059:001 ¶  Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God, From my withstanders set me on high.
059:002 Deliver me from workers of iniquity, And from men of blood save me.
059:003 For, lo, they laid wait for my soul, Assembled against me are strong ones, Not my transgression nor my sin, O Jehovah.
059:004 Without punishment they run and prepare themselves, Stir up to meet me, and see.
059:005 And Thou, Jehovah, God of Hosts, God of Israel, Awake to inspect all the nations. Favour not any treacherous dealers of iniquity. Selah.
059:006 They turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And go round about the city.
059:007 Lo, they belch out with their mouths, Swords are in their lips, for ‘Who heareth?’
059:008 And Thou, O Jehovah dost laugh at them, Thou dost mock at all the nations.
059:009 O my Strength, unto Thee I take heed, For God is my tower-the God of my kindness.
059:010 God doth go before me, He causeth me to look on mine enemies.
059:011 Slay them not, lest my people forget, Shake them by Thy strength, And bring them down, O Lord our shield.
059:012 The sin of their mouth is a word of their lips, And they are captured in their pride, And from the curse and lying they recount.
059:013 Consume in fury, consume and they are not, And they know that God is ruling in Jacob, To the ends of the earth. Selah.
059:014 And they turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And they go round about the city.
059:015 They-they wander for food, If they are not satisfied-then they murmur.
059:016 And I-I sing of Thy strength, And I sing at morn of Thy kindness, For thou hast been a tower to me, And a refuge for me in a day of adversity.
059:017 O my Strength, unto Thee I sing praise, For God is my tower, the God of my kindness!
060:001 ¶  O God, Thou hadst cast us off, Thou hadst broken us-hadst been angry! -Thou dost turn back to us.
060:002 Thou hast caused the land to tremble, Thou hast broken it, Heal its breaches, for it hath moved.
060:003 Thou hast shewn Thy people a hard thing, Thou hast caused us to drink wine of trembling.
060:004 Thou hast given to those fearing thee an ensign. To be lifted up as an ensign Because of truth. Selah.
060:005 That Thy beloved ones may be drawn out, Save with Thy right hand, and answer us.
060:006 God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult-I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,
060:007 Mine is Gilead, and mine is Manasseh, And Ephraim is the strength of my head, Judah is my lawgiver,
060:008 Moab is my pot for washing, over Edom I cast my shoe, Shout, concerning me, O Philistia.
060:009 Who doth bring me to a city of bulwarks? Who hath led me unto Edom?
060:010 Is it not Thou, O God? hast Thou cast us off? And dost Thou not go forth, O God, with our hosts!
060:011 Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the deliverance of man.
060:012 In God we do mightily, And He treadeth down our adversaries!
061:001 ¶  Hear, O God, my loud cry, attend to my prayer.
061:002 From the end of the land unto Thee I call, In the feebleness of my heart, Into a rock higher than I Thou dost lead me.
061:003 For Thou hast been a refuge for me, A tower of strength because of the enemy.
061:004 I sojourn in Thy tent to the ages, I trust in the secret place of Thy wings. Selah.
061:005 For Thou, O God, hast hearkened to my vows, Thou hast appointed the inheritance Of those fearing Thy name.
061:006 Days to the days of the king Thou addest, His years as generation and generation.
061:007 He dwelleth to the age before God, Kindness and truth appoint-they keep him.
061:008 So do I praise Thy name for ever, When I pay my vows day by day!
062:001 ¶  Only-toward God is my soul silent, From Him is my salvation.
062:002 Only-He is my rock, and my salvation, My tower, I am not much moved.
062:003 Till when do ye devise mischief against a man? Ye are destroyed all of you, As a wall inclined, a hedge that is cast down.
062:004 Only-from his excellency They have consulted to drive away, They enjoy a lie, with their mouth they bless, And with their heart revile. Selah.
062:005 Only-for God, be silent, O my soul, For from Him is my hope.
062:006 Only-He is my rock and my salvation, My tower, I am not moved.
062:007 On God is my salvation, and my honour, The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.
062:008 Trust in Him at all times, O people, Pour forth before Him your heart, God is a refuge for us. Selah.
062:009 Only-vanity are the low, a lie the high. In balances to go up they than vanity are lighter.
062:010 Trust not in oppression, And in robbery become not vain, Wealth-when it increaseth-set not the heart.
062:011 Once hath God spoken, twice I heard this, That ‘strength is with God.’
062:012 And with Thee, O Lord, is kindness, For Thou dost recompense to each, According to his work!
063:001 ¶  O God, Thou art my God, earnestly do I seek Thee, Thirsted for Thee hath my soul, Longed for Thee hath my flesh, In a land dry and weary, without waters.
063:002 So in the sanctuary I have seen Thee, To behold Thy strength and Thine honour.
063:003 Because better is Thy kindness than life, My lips do praise Thee.
063:004 So I bless Thee in my life, in Thy name I lift up my hands.
063:005 As with milk and fatness is my soul satisfied, And with singing lips doth my mouth praise.
063:006 If I have remembered Thee on my couch, In the watches-I meditate on Thee.
063:007 For Thou hast been a help to me, And in the shadow of Thy wings I sing.
063:008 Cleaved hath my soul after Thee, On me hath Thy right hand taken hold.
063:009 And they who for desolation seek my soul, Go in to the lower parts of the earth.
063:010 They cause him to run on the edge of the sword, A portion for foxes they are.
063:011 And the king doth rejoice in God, Boast himself doth every one swearing by Him, But stopped is the mouth of those speaking lies!
064:001 ¶  Hear, O God, my voice, in my meditation, From the fear of an enemy Thou keepest my life,
064:002 Hidest me from the secret counsel of evil doers, From the tumult of workers of iniquity.
064:003 Who sharpened as a sword their tongue, They directed their arrow-a bitter word.
064:004 To shoot in secret places the perfect, Suddenly they shoot him, and fear not.
064:005 They strengthen for themselves an evil thing, They recount of the hiding of snares, They have said, ‘Who doth look at it?’
064:006 They search out perverse things, ‘We perfected a searching search,’ And the inward part of man, and the heart are deep.
064:007 And God doth shoot them with an arrow, Sudden have been their wounds,
064:008 And they cause him to stumble, Against them is their own tongue, Every looker on them fleeth away.
064:009 And all men fear, and declare the work of God, And His deed they have considered wisely.
064:010 The righteous doth rejoice in Jehovah, And hath trusted in Him, And boast themselves do all the upright of heart!
065:001 ¶  To Thee, silence-praise, O God, is in Zion, And to Thee is a vow completed.
065:002 Hearer of prayer, to Thee all flesh cometh.
065:003 Matters of iniquities were mightier than I, Our transgressions-Thou dost cover them.
065:004 O the happiness of him whom Thou choosest, And drawest near, he inhabiteth Thy courts, We are satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, Thy holy temple.
065:005 By fearful things in righteousness Thou answerest us, O God of our salvation, The confidence of all far off ends of earth and sea.
065:006 Establishing mountains by His power, He hath been girded with might,
065:007 Restraining the noise of seas, the noise of their billows, And the multitude of the peoples.
065:008 And the inhabitants of the uttermost parts From Thy signs are afraid, The outgoings of morning and evening Thou causest to sing.
065:009 Thou hast inspected the earth, and waterest it, Thou makest it very rich, the rivulet of God is full of water, Thou preparest their corn, When thus Thou dost prepare it,
065:010 Its ridges have been filled, Deepened hath been its furrow, With showers Thou dost soften it, Its springing up Thou blessest.
065:011 Thou hast crowned the year of Thy goodness, And Thy paths drop fatness.
065:012 Drop do the pastures of a wilderness, And joy of the heights Thou girdest on.
065:013 Clothed have lambs the flock, And valleys are covered with corn, They shout-yea, they sing!
066:001 ¶  Shout ye to God, all the earth.
066:002 Praise ye the honour of His name, Make ye honourable His praise.
066:003 Say to God, ‘How fearful are Thy works, By the abundance of Thy strength, Thine enemies feign obedience to Thee.
066:004 All the earth do bow to Thee, They sing praise to Thee, they praise Thy name.’ Selah.
066:005 Come ye, and see the works of God, Fearful acts toward the sons of men.
066:006 He hath turned a sea to dry land, Through a river they pass over on foot, There do we rejoice in Him.
066:007 Ruling by His might to the age, His eyes among the nations do watch, The refractory exalt not themselves. Selah.
066:008 Bless, ye peoples, our God, And sound the voice of His praise,
066:009 Who hath placed our soul in life, And suffered not our feet to be moved.
066:010 For Thou hast tried us, O God, Thou hast refined us as the refining of silver.
066:011 Thou hast brought us into a net, Thou hast placed pressure on our loins.
066:012 Thou hast caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, And Thou bringest us out to a watered place.
066:013 I enter Thy house with burnt-offerings, I complete to Thee my vows,
066:014 For opened were my lips, And my mouth spake in my distress:
066:015 ‘Burnt-offerings of fatlings I offer to Thee, With perfume of rams, I prepare a bullock with he-goats.’ Selah.
066:016 Come, hear, all ye who fear God, And I recount what he did for my soul.
066:017 Unto Him with my mouth I have called, And exaltation is under my tongue.
066:018 Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, The Lord doth not hear.
066:019 But God hath heard, He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
066:020 Blessed is God, Who hath not turned aside my prayer, And His loving-kindness, from me!
067:001 ¶  God doth favour us and bless us, Doth cause His face to shine with us. Selah.
067:002 For the knowledge in earth of Thy way, among all nations of Thy salvation.
067:003 Praise Thee do peoples, O God, Praise Thee do peoples, all of them.
067:004 Rejoice and sing do nations, For Thou judgest peoples uprightly, And peoples on earth comfortest. Selah.
067:005 Confess Thee do peoples, O God, Confess Thee do peoples-all of them.
067:006 Earth hath given her increase, God doth bless us-our God,
067:007 God doth bless us, and all ends of earth fear Him!
068:001 ¶  Rise doth God-scattered are His enemies! And those hating Him flee from His face.
068:002 As the driving away of smoke Thou drivest away, As the melting of wax before fire, The wicked perish at the presence of God.
068:003 And the righteous rejoice, they exult before God, And they joy with gladness.
068:004 Sing ye to God-praise His name, Raise up a highway for Him who is riding in deserts, In Jah is His name, and exult before Him.
068:005 Father of the fatherless, and judge of the widows, Is God in His holy habitation.
068:006 God-causing the lonely to dwell at home, Bringing out bound ones into prosperity, Only-the refractory have inhabited a dry place.
068:007 O God, in Thy going forth before Thy people, In Thy stepping through the wilderness, Selah.
068:008 The earth hath shaken, Yea, the heavens have dropped before God, This Sinai-before God, the God of Israel.
068:009 A shower of free-will gifts thou shakest out, O God. Thine inheritance, when it hath been weary, Thou hast established it.
068:010 Thy company have dwelt in it, Thou preparest in Thy goodness for the poor, O God.
068:011 The Lord doth give the saying, The female proclaimers are a numerous host.
068:012 Kings of hosts flee utterly away, And a female inhabitant of the house apportioneth spoil.
068:013 Though ye do lie between two boundaries, Wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold.
068:014 When the Mighty spreadeth kings in it, It doth snow in Salmon.
068:015 A hill of God is the hill of Bashan, A hill of heights is the hill of Bashan.
068:016 Why do ye envy, O high hills, The hill God hath desired for His seat? Jehovah also doth tabernacle for ever.
068:017 The chariots of God are myriads, thousands of changes, The Lord is among them, in Sinai, in the sanctuary.
068:018 Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast taken captive captivity, Thou hast taken gifts for men, That even the refractory may rest, O Jah God.
068:019 Blessed is the Lord, day by day He layeth on us. God Himself is our salvation. Selah.
068:020 God Himself is to us a God for deliverances, And Jehovah Lord hath the outgoings of death.
068:021 Only-God doth smite The head of His enemies, The hairy crown of a habitual walker in his guilt.
068:022 The Lord said: ‘From Bashan I bring back, I bring back from the depths of the sea.
068:023 So that thou dashest thy foot in blood, In the blood of enemies-the tongue of Thy dogs.’
068:024 They have seen Thy goings, O God, Goings of my God, my king, in the sanctuary.
068:025 Singers have been before, Behind are players on instruments, In the midst virgins playing with timbrels.
068:026 In assemblies bless ye God, The Lord-from the fountain of Israel.
068:027 There is little Benjamin their ruler, Heads of Judah their defence, Heads of Zebulun-heads of Naphtali.
068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength, Be strong, O God, this Thou hast wrought for us.
068:029 Because of Thy temple at Jerusalem, To Thee do kings bring a present.
068:030 Rebuke a beast of the reeds, a company of bulls, With calves of the peoples, Each humbling himself with pieces of silver, Scatter Thou peoples delighting in conflicts.
068:031 Come do fat ones out of Egypt, Cush causeth her hands to run to God.
068:032 Kingdoms of the earth, sing ye to God, Praise ye the Lord. Selah.
068:033 To him who is riding on the heavens of the heavens of old, Lo, He giveth with His voice a strong voice.
068:034 Ascribe ye strength to God, Over Israel is His excellency, and His strength in the clouds.
068:035 Fearful, O God, out of Thy sanctuaries, The God of Israel Himself, Giving strength and might to the people. Blessed is God!
069:001 ¶  Save me, O God, for come have waters unto the soul.
069:002 I have sunk in deep mire, And there is no standing, I have come into the depths of the waters, And a flood hath overflown me.
069:003 I have been wearied with my calling, Burnt hath been my throat, Consumed have been mine eyes, waiting for my God.
069:004 Those hating me without cause Have been more than the hairs of my head, Mighty have been my destroyers, My lying enemies, That which I took not away-I bring back.
069:005 O God, Thou-Thou hast known Concerning my overturn, And my desolations from Thee have not been hid.
069:006 Let not those waiting on Thee be ashamed because of me, O Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, Let not those seeking Thee Blush because of me, O God of Israel.
069:007 For because of Thee I have borne reproach, Shame hath covered my face.
069:008 A stranger I have been to my brother, And a foreigner to sons of my mother.
069:009 For zeal for Thy house hath consumed me, And the reproaches of Thy reproachers Have fallen upon me.
069:010 And I weep in the fasting of my soul, And it is for a reproach to me.
069:011 And I make my clothing sackcloth, And I am to them for a simile.
069:012 Those sitting at the gate meditate concerning me, And those drinking strong drink, Play on instruments.
069:013 And I-my prayer is to Thee, O Jehovah, A time of good pleasure, O God, In the abundance of Thy kindness, Answer me in the truth of Thy salvation.
069:014 Deliver me from the mire, and let me not sink, Let me be delivered from those hating me, And from deep places of waters.
069:015 Let not a flood of waters overflow me, Nor let the deep swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut her mouth upon me.
069:016 Answer me, O Jehovah, for good is Thy kindness, According to the abundance Of Thy mercies turn Thou unto me,
069:017 And hide not Thy face from Thy servant, For I am in distress-haste, answer me.
069:018 Be near unto my soul-redeem it, Because of mine enemies ransom me.
069:019 Thou-Thou hast known my reproach, And my shame, and my blushing, Before Thee are all mine adversaries.
069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am sick, And I look for a bemoaner, and there is none, And for comforters, and I have found none.
069:021 And they give for my food gall, And for my thirst cause me to drink vinegar.
069:022 Their table before them is for a snare, And for a recompence-for a trap.
069:023 Darkened are their eyes from seeing, And their loins continually shake Thou.
069:024 Pour upon them Thine indignation, And the fierceness of Thine anger doth seize them.
069:025 Their tower is desolated, In their tents there is no dweller.
069:026 For they have pursued him Thou hast smitten, And recount of the pain of Thy pierced ones.
069:027 Give punishment for their iniquity, And they enter not into Thy righteousness.
069:028 They are blotted out of the book of life, And with the righteous are not written.
069:029 And I am afflicted and pained, Thy salvation, O God, doth set me on high.
069:030 I praise the name of God with a song, And I magnify Him with thanksgiving,
069:031 And it is better to Jehovah than an ox, A bullock-horned-hoofed.
069:032 The humble have seen-they rejoice, Ye who seek God-and your heart liveth.
069:033 For Jehovah hearkeneth unto the needy, And His bound ones He hath not despised.
069:034 The heavens and earth do praise Him, Seas, and every moving thing in them.
069:035 For God doth save Zion, And doth build the cities of Judah, And they have dwelt there, and possess it.
069:036 And the seed of His servants inherit it, And those loving His name dwell in it!
070:001 ¶  O God, to deliver me, O Jehovah, for my help, haste.
070:002 Let them be ashamed and confounded Who are seeking my soul, Let them be turned backward and blush Who are desiring my evil.
070:003 Let them turn back because of their shame, Who are saying, ‘Aha, aha.’
070:004 Let all those seeking Thee joy and be glad in Thee, And let those loving Thy salvation Say continually, ‘God is magnified.’
070:005 And I am poor and needy, O God, haste to me, My help and my deliverer art Thou, O Jehovah, tarry Thou not!
071:001 ¶  In Thee, O Jehovah, I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed to the age.
071:002 In Thy righteousness Thou dost deliver me, And dost cause me to escape, Incline unto me Thine ear, and save me.
071:003 Be to me for a rock-a habitation, To go in continually, Thou hast given command to save me, For my rock and my bulwark art Thou.
071:004 O my God, cause me to escape From the hand of the wicked, From the hand of the perverse and violent.
071:005 For Thou art my hope, O Lord Jehovah, My trust from my youth.
071:006 By Thee I have been supported from the womb, From my mother’s bowels Thou dost cut me out, In Thee is my praise continually.
071:007 As a wonder I have been to many, And Thou art my strong refuge.
071:008 Filled is my mouth with Thy praise, All the day with Thy beauty.
071:009 Cast me not off at the time of old age, According to the consumption of my power forsake me not.
071:010 For mine enemies have spoken against me, And those watching my soul have taken counsel together,
071:011 Saying, ‘God hath forsaken him, Pursue and catch him, for there is no deliverer.’
071:012 O God, be not far from me, O my God, for my help make haste.
071:013 They are ashamed, they are consumed, Who are opposing my soul, They are covered with reproach and blushing, who are seeking my evil,
071:014 And I continually do wait with hope, And have added unto all Thy praise.
071:015 My mouth recounteth Thy righteousness, All the day Thy salvation, For I have not known the numbers.
071:016 I come in the might of the Lord Jehovah, I mention Thy righteousness-Thine only.
071:017 God, Thou hast taught me from my youth, And hitherto I declare Thy wonders.
071:018 And also unto old age and grey hairs, O God, forsake me not, T ll I declare Thy strength to a generation, To every one that cometh Thy might.
071:019 And Thy righteousness, O God, is unto the heights, Because Thou hast done great things, O God, who is like Thee?
071:020 Because Thou hast showed me many and sad distresses, Thou turnest back-Thou revivest me, And from the depths of the earth, Thou turnest back-Thou bringest me up.
071:021 Thou dost increase my greatness, And Thou surroundest-Thou comfortest me,
071:022 I also thank Thee with a vessel of psaltery, Thy truth, O my God, I sing to Thee with a harp, O Holy One of Israel,
071:023 My lips cry aloud when I sing praise to Thee, And my soul that Thou hast redeemed,
071:024 My tongue also all the day uttereth Thy righteousness, Because ashamed-because confounded, Have been those seeking my evil!
072:001 ¶  O God, Thy judgments to the king give, And Thy righteousness to the king’s son.
072:002 He judgeth Thy people with righteousness, And Thy poor with judgment.
072:003 The mountains bear peace to the people, And the heights by righteousness.
072:004 He judgeth the poor of the people, Giveth deliverance to the sons of the needy, And bruiseth the oppressor.
072:005 They fear Thee with the sun, and before the moon, Generation-generations.
072:006 He cometh down as rain on mown grass, As showers-sprinkling the earth.
072:007 Flourish in his days doth the righteous, And abundance of peace till the moon is not.
072:008 And he ruleth from sea unto sea, And from the river unto the ends of earth.
072:009 Before him bow do the inhabitants of the dry places, And his enemies lick the dust.
072:010 Kings of Tarshish and of the isles send back a present. Kings of Sheba and Seba a reward bring near.
072:011 And all kings do bow themselves to him, All nations do serve him,
072:012 For he delivereth the needy who crieth, And the poor when he hath no helper,
072:013 He hath pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he saveth,
072:014 From fraud and from violence he redeemeth their soul, And precious is their blood in his eyes.
072:015 And he liveth, and giveth to him of the gold of Sheba, And prayeth for him continually, All the day he doth bless him.
072:016 There is a handful of corn in the earth, On the top of mountains, Shake like Lebanon doth its fruit, And they flourish out of the city as the herb of the earth.
072:017 His name is to the age, Before the sun is his name continued, And they bless themselves in him, All nations do pronounce him happy.
072:018 Blessed is Jehovah God, God of Israel, He alone is doing wonders, And blessed is the Name of His honour to the age, And the whole earth is filled with His honour. Amen, and amen! The prayers of David son of Jesse have been ended.
073:001 ¶  Only-good to Israel is God, to the clean of heart. And I-as a little thing, My feet have been turned aside,
073:002 As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious of the boastful,
073:003 The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at their death,
073:004 And their might is firm.
073:005 In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men they are not plagued.
073:006 Therefore hath pride encircled them, Violence covereth them as a dress.
073:007 Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;
073:008 They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of oppression, From on high they speak.
073:009 They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue walketh in the earth.
073:010 Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of fulness are wrung out to them.
073:011 And they have said, ‘How hath God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?’
073:012 Lo, these are the wicked and easy ones of the age, They have increased strength.
073:013 Only-a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash in innocency my hands,
073:014 And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof is every morning.
073:015 If I have said, ‘I recount thus,’ Lo, a generation of Thy sons I have deceived.
073:016 And I think to know this, Perverseness it is in mine eyes,
073:017 Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to their latter end.
073:018 Only, in slippery places Thou dost set them, Thou hast caused them to fall to desolations.
073:019 How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They have been ended-consumed from terrors.
073:020 As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image Thou despisest.
073:021 For my heart doth show itself violent, And my reins prick themselves,
073:022 And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been with Thee.
073:023 And I am continually with Thee, Thou hast laid hold on my right hand.
073:024 With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And after honour dost receive me.
073:025 Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have desired in earth.
073:026 Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my heart and my portion is God to the age.
073:027 For, lo, those far from Thee do perish, Thou hast cut off every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.
073:028 And I-nearness of God to me is good, I have placed in the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy works!
074:001 ¶  Why, O God, hast Thou cast off for ever? Thine anger smoketh against the flock of Thy pasture.
074:002 Remember Thy company. Thou didst purchase of old, Thou didst redeem the rod of Thy inheritance, This mount Zion-Thou didst dwell in it.
074:003 Lift up Thy steps to the perpetual desolations, Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary.
074:004 Roared have thine adversaries, In the midst of Thy meeting-places, They have set their ensigns as ensigns.
074:005 He is known as one bringing in on high Against a thicket of wood-axes.
074:006 And now, its carvings together With axe and hatchet they break down,
074:007 They have sent into fire Thy sanctuary, to the earth they polluted the tabernacle of Thy name,
074:008 They said in their hearts, ‘Let us oppress them together,’ They did burn all the meeting-places of God in the land.
074:009 Our ensigns we have not seen, There is no more a prophet, Nor with us is one knowing how long.
074:010 Till when, O God, doth an adversary reproach? Doth an enemy despise thy name for ever?
074:011 Why dost Thou turn back Thy hand, Even Thy right hand? From the midst of Thy bosom remove it.
074:012 And God is my king of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
074:013 Thou hast broken by Thy strength a sea-monster, Thou hast shivered Heads of dragons by the waters,
074:014 Thou hast broken the heads of leviathan, Thou makest him food, For the people of the dry places.
074:015 Thou hast cleaved a fountain and a stream, Thou hast dried up perennial flowings.
074:016 Thine is the day, also Thine is the night, Thou hast prepared a light giver-the sun.
074:017 Thou hast set up all the borders of earth, Summer and winter Thou hast formed them.
074:018 Remember this-an enemy reproached Jehovah, And a foolish people have despised Thy name.
074:019 Give not up to a company, The soul of Thy turtle-dove, The company of Thy poor ones forget not for ever.
074:020 Look attentively to the covenant, For the dark places of earth, Have been full of habitations of violence.
074:021 Let not the oppressed turn back ashamed, Let the poor and needy praise Thy name,
074:022 Arise, O God, plead Thy plea, Remember Thy reproach from a fool all the day.
074:023 Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, The noise of Thy withstanders is going up continually!
075:001 ¶  We have given thanks to Thee, O God, We have given thanks, and near is Thy name, They have recounted Thy wonders.
075:002 When I receive an appointment, I-I do judge uprightly.
075:003 Melted is the earth and all its inhabitants, I-I have pondered its pillars. Selah.
075:004 I have said to the boastful, ‘Be not boastful,’ And to the wicked, ‘Raise not up a horn.’
075:005 Raise not up on high your horn, (Ye speak with a stiff neck.)
075:006 For not from the east, or from the west, Nor from the wilderness-is elevation.
075:007 But God is judge, This He maketh low-and this He lifteth up.
075:008 For a cup is in the hand of Jehovah, And the wine hath foamed, It is full of mixture, and He poureth out of it, Only its dregs wring out, and drink, Do all the wicked of the earth,
075:009 And I-I declare it to the age, I sing praise to the God of Jacob.
075:010 And all horns of the wicked I cut off, Exalted are the horns of the righteous!
076:001 ¶  In Judah is God known, in Israel His name is great.
076:002 And His tabernacle is in Salem, And His habitation in Zion.
076:003 There he hath shivered arrows of a bow, Shield, and sword, and battle. Selah.
076:004 Bright art Thou, honourable above hills of prey.
076:005 Spoiled themselves have the mighty of heart, They have slept their sleep, And none of the men of might found their hands.
076:006 From Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse have been fast asleep.
076:007 Thou, fearful art Thou, And who doth stand before Thee, Since Thou hast been angry!
076:008 From heaven Thou hast sounded judgment, Earth hath feared, and hath been still,
076:009 In the rising of God to judgment, To save all the humble of earth. Selah.
076:010 For the fierceness of man praiseth Thee, The remnant of fierceness Thou girdest on.
076:011 Vow and complete to Jehovah your God, All ye surrounding him. They bring presents to the Fearful One.
076:012 He doth gather the spirit of leaders, Fearful to the kings of earth!
077:001 ¶  My voice is to God, and I cry, my voice is to God, And He hath given ear unto me.
077:002 In a day of my distress the Lord I sought, My hand by night hath been spread out, And it doth not cease, My soul hath refused to be comforted.
077:003 I remember God, and make a noise, I meditate, and feeble is my spirit. Selah.
077:004 Thou hast taken hold of the watches of mine eyes, I have been moved, and I speak not.
077:005 I have reckoned the days of old, The years of the ages.
077:006 I remember my music in the night, With my heart I meditate, and my spirit doth search diligently:
077:007 To the ages doth the Lord cast off? Doth He add to be pleased no more?
077:008 Hath His kindness ceased for ever? The saying failed to all generations?
077:009 Hath God forgotten His favours? Hath He shut up in anger His mercies? Selah.
077:010 And I say: ‘My weakness is, The changes of the right hand of the Most High.’
077:011 I mention the doings of Jah, For I remember of old Thy wonders,
077:012 And I have meditated on all Thy working, And I talk concerning Thy doings.
077:013 O God, in holiness is Thy way, Who is a great god like God?
077:014 Thou art the God doing wonders. Thou hast made known among the peoples Thy strength,
077:015 Thou hast redeemed with strength Thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
077:016 The waters have seen Thee, O God, The waters have seen Thee, They are afraid-also depths are troubled.
077:017 Poured out waters have thick clouds, The skies have given forth a noise, Also-Thine arrows go up and down.
077:018 The voice of Thy thunder is in the spheres, Lightnings have lightened the world, The earth hath trembled, yea, it shaketh.
077:019 In the sea is Thy way, And Thy paths are in many waters, And Thy tracks have not been known.
077:020 Thou hast led as a flock Thy people, By the hand of Moses and Aaron!
078:001 ¶  Give ear, O my people, to my law, Incline your ear to sayings of my mouth.
078:002 I open with a simile my mouth, I bring forth hidden things of old,
078:003 That we have heard and do know, And our fathers have recounted to us.
078:004 We do not hide from their sons, To a later generation recounting praises of Jehovah, And His strength, and His wonders that He hath done.
078:005 And He raiseth up a testimony in Jacob, And a law hath placed in Israel, That He commanded our fathers, To make them known to their sons.
078:006 So that a later generation doth know, Sons who are born, do rise and recount to their sons,
078:007 And place in God their confidence, And forget not the doings of God, But keep His commands.
078:008 And they are not like their fathers, A generation apostate and rebellious, A generation! it hath not prepared its heart, Nor stedfast with God is its spirit.
078:009 Sons of Ephraim-armed bearers of bow, Have turned in a day of conflict.
078:010 They have not kept the covenant of God, And in His law they have refused to walk,
078:011 And they forget His doings, And His wonders that He shewed them.
078:012 Before their fathers He hath done wonders, In the land of Egypt-the field of Zoan.
078:013 He cleft a sea, and causeth them to pass over, Yea, He causeth waters to stand as a heap.
078:014 And leadeth them with a cloud by day, And all the night with a light of fire.
078:015 He cleaveth rocks in a wilderness, And giveth drink-as the great deep.
078:016 And bringeth out streams from a rock, And causeth waters to come down as rivers.
078:017 And they add still to sin against Him, To provoke the Most High in the dry place.
078:018 And they try God in their heart, To ask food for their lust.
078:019 And they speak against God-they said: ‘Is God able to array a table in a wilderness?’
078:020 Lo, He hath smitten a rock, And waters flow, yea, streams overflow. ‘ Also-bread is He able to give? Doth He prepare flesh for His people?’
078:021 Therefore hath Jehovah heard, And He sheweth Himself wroth, And fire hath been kindled against Jacob, And anger also hath gone up against Israel,
078:022 For they have not believed in God, Nor have they trusted in His salvation.
078:023 And He commandeth clouds from above, Yea, doors of the heavens He hath opened.
078:024 And He raineth on them manna to eat, Yea, corn of heaven He hath given to them.
078:025 Food of the mighty hath each eaten, Venison He sent to them to satiety.
078:026 He causeth an east wind to journey in the heavens, And leadeth by His strength a south wind,
078:027 And He raineth on them flesh as dust, And as sand of the seas-winged fowl,
078:028 And causeth it to fall in the midst of His camp, Round about His tabernacles.
078:029 And they eat, and are greatly satisfied, And their desire He bringeth to them.
078:030 They have not been estranged from their desire, Yet is their food in their mouth,
078:031 And the anger of God hath gone up against them, And He slayeth among their fat ones, And youths of Israel He caused to bend.
078:032 With all this they have sinned again, And have not believed in His wonders.
078:033 And He consumeth in vanity their days, And their years in trouble.
078:034 If He slew them, then they sought Him, And turned back, and sought God earnestly,
078:035 And they remember that God is their rock, And God Most High their redeemer.
078:036 And-they deceive Him with their mouth, And with their tongue do lie to Him,
078:037 And their heart hath not been right with Him, And they have not been stedfast in His covenant.
078:038 And He-the Merciful One, Pardoneth iniquity, and destroyeth not, And hath often turned back His anger, And waketh not up all His fury.
078:039 And He remembereth that they are flesh, A wind going on-and it returneth not.
078:040 How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness, Grieve Him in the desolate place?
078:041 Yea, they turn back, and try God, And the Holy One of Israel have limited.
078:042 They have not remembered His hand The day He ransomed them from the adversary.
078:043 When He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan,
078:044 And He turneth to blood their streams, And their floods they drink not.
078:045 He sendeth among them the beetle, and it consumeth them, And the frog, and it destroyeth them,
078:046 And giveth to the caterpillar their increase, And their labour to the locust.
078:047 He destroyeth with hail their vine, And their sycamores with frost,
078:048 And delivereth up to the hail their beasts, And their cattle to the burning flames.
078:049 He sendeth on them the fury of His anger, Wrath, and indignation, and distress- A discharge of evil messengers.
078:050 He pondereth a path for His anger, He kept not back their soul from death, Yea, their life to the pestilence He delivered up.
078:051 And He smiteth every first-born in Egypt, The first-fruit of the strong in tents of Ham.
078:052 And causeth His people to journey as a flock, And guideth them as a drove in a wilderness,
078:053 And He leadeth them confidently, And they have not been afraid, And their enemies hath the sea covered.
078:054 And He bringeth them in unto the border of His sanctuary, This mountain His right hand had got,
078:055 And casteth out nations from before them, And causeth them to fall in the line of inheritance, And causeth the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents,
078:056 And they tempt and provoke God Most High, And His testimonies have not kept.
078:057 And they turn back, And deal treacherously like their fathers, They have been turned like a deceitful bow,
078:058 And make Him angry with their high places, And with their graven images make Him zealous,
078:059 God hath heard, and sheweth Himself wroth. And kicketh exceedingly against Israel.
078:060 And He leaveth the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent He had placed among men,
078:061 And He giveth His strength to captivity, And His beauty into the hand of an adversary,
078:062 And delivereth up to the sword His people, And with His inheritance shewed Himself angry.
078:063 His young men hath fire consumed, And His virgins have not been praised.
078:064 His priests by the sword have fallen, And their widows weep not.
078:065 And the Lord waketh as a sleeper, As a mighty one crying aloud from wine.
078:066 And He smiteth His adversaries backward, A reproach age-during He hath put on them,
078:067 And He kicketh against the tent of Joseph, And on the tribe of Ephraim hath not fixed.
078:068 And He chooseth the tribe of Judah, With mount Zion that He loved,
078:069 And buildeth His sanctuary as a high place, Like the earth, He founded it to the age.
078:070 And He fixeth on David His servant, And taketh him from the folds of a flock,
078:071 From behind suckling ones He hath brought him in, To rule over Jacob His people, And over Israel His inheritance.
078:072 And he ruleth them according to the integrity of his heart, And by the skilfulness of his hands leadeth them!
079:001 ¶  O God, nations have come into Thy inheritance, They have defiled Thy holy temple, They made Jerusalem become heaps,
079:002 They gave the dead bodies of Thy servants Food for the fowls of the heavens, The flesh of Thy saints For the wild beast of the earth.
079:003 They have shed their blood As water round about Jerusalem, And there is none burying.
079:004 We have been a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a derision to our surrounders.
079:005 Till when, O Jehovah? art Thou angry for ever? Thy jealousy doth burn as fire.
079:006 Pour Thy fury on the nations who have not known Thee, And on kingdoms that have not called in Thy name.
079:007 For one hath devoured Jacob, And his habitation they have made desolate.
079:008 Remember not for us the iniquities of forefathers, Haste, let Thy mercies go before us, For we have been very weak.
079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, Because of the honour of Thy name, And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For Thy name’s sake.
079:010 Why do the nations say, ‘Where is their God?’ Let be known among the nations before our eyes, The vengeance of the blood of Thy servants that is shed.
079:011 Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before Thee, According to the greatness of Thine arm, Leave Thou the sons of death.
079:012 And turn Thou back to our neighbours, Sevenfold unto their bosom, their reproach, Wherewith they reproached Thee, O Lord.
079:013 And we, Thy people, and the flock of Thy pasture, We give thanks to Thee to the age, To all generations we recount Thy praise!
080:001 ¶  Shepherd of Israel, give ear, Leading Joseph as a flock, Inhabiting the cherubs-shine forth,
080:002 Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, Wake up Thy might, and come for our salvation.
080:003 O God, cause us to turn back, And cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved.
080:004 Jehovah, God of Hosts, till when? Thou hast burned against the prayer of Thy people.
080:005 Thou hast caused them to eat bread of tears, And causest them to drink With tears a third time.
080:006 Thou makest us a strife to our neighbours, And our enemies mock at it.
080:007 God of Hosts, turn us back, And cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved.
080:008 A vine out of Egypt Thou dost bring, Thou dost cast out nations, and plantest it.
080:009 Thou hast looked before it, and dost root it, And it filleth the land,
080:010 Covered have been hills with its shadow, And its boughs are cedars of God.
080:011 It sendeth forth its branches unto the sea, And unto the river its sucklings.
080:012 Why hast Thou broken down its hedges, And all passing by the way have plucked it?
080:013 A boar out of the forest doth waste it, And a wild beast of the fields consumeth it.
080:014 God of Hosts, turn back, we beseech Thee, Look from heaven, and see, and inspect this vine,
080:015 And the root that Thy right hand planted, And the branch Thou madest strong for Thee,
080:016 Burnt with fire-cut down, From the rebuke of Thy face they perish.
080:017 Let Thy hand be on the man of Thy right hand, On the son of man Thou hast strengthened for Thyself.
080:018 And we do not go back from Thee, Thou dost revive us, and in Thy name we call.
080:019 O Jehovah, God of Hosts, turn us back, Cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved!
081:001 ¶  Cry aloud to God our strength, Shout to the God of Jacob.
081:002 Lift up a song, and give out a timbrel, A pleasant harp with psaltery.
081:003 Blow in the month a trumpet, In the new moon, at the day of our festival,
081:004 For a statute to Israel it is, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
081:005 A testimony on Joseph He hath placed it, In his going forth over the land of Egypt. A lip, I have not known-I hear.
081:006 From the burden his shoulder I turned aside, His hands from the basket pass over.
081:007 In distress thou hast called and I deliver thee, I answer thee in the secret place of thunder, I try thee by the waters of Meribah. Selah.
081:008 Hear, O My people, and I testify to thee, O Israel, if thou dost hearken to me:
081:009 There is not in thee a strange god, And thou bowest not thyself to a strange god.
081:010 I am Jehovah thy God, Who bringeth thee up out of the land of Egypt. Enlarge thy mouth, and I fill it.
081:011 But, My people hearkened not to My voice, And Israel hath not consented to Me.
081:012 And I send them away in the enmity of their heart, They walk in their own counsels.
081:013 O that My people were hearkening to Me, Israel in My ways would walk.
081:014 As a little thing their enemies I cause to bow, And against their adversaries I turn back My hand,
081:015 Those hating Jehovah feign obedience to Him, But their time is-to the age.
081:016 He causeth him to eat of the fat of wheat, And with honey from a rock I satisfy thee!
082:001 ¶  God hath stood in the company of God, In the midst God doth judge.
082:002 Till when do ye judge perversely? And the face of the wicked lift up? Selah.
082:003 Judge ye the weak and fatherless, The afflicted and the poor declare righteous.
082:004 Let the weak and needy escape, From the hand of the wicked deliver them.
082:005 They knew not, nor do they understand, In darkness they walk habitually, Moved are all the foundations of earth.
082:006 I-I have said, ‘Gods ye are, And sons of the Most High-all of you,
082:007 But as man ye die, and as one of the heads ye fall,
082:008 Rise, O God, judge the earth, For Thou hast inheritance among all the nations!
083:001 ¶  O God, let there be no silence to Thee, Be not silent, nor be quiet, O God.
083:002 For, lo, Thine enemies do roar, And those hating Thee have lifted up the head,
083:003 Against Thy people they take crafty counsel, And consult against Thy hidden ones.
083:004 They have said, ‘Come, And we cut them off from being a nation, And the name of Israel is not remembered any more.’
083:005 For they consulted in heart together, Against Thee a covenant they make,
083:006 Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes,
083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with inhabitants of Tyre,
083:008 Asshur also is joined with them, They have been an arm to sons of Lot. Selah.
083:009 Do to them as to Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the stream Kishon.
083:010 They were destroyed at Endor, They were dung for the ground!
083:011 Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb, And as Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes,
083:012 Who have said, ‘Let us occupy for ourselves The comely places of God.’
083:013 O my God, make them as a rolling thing, As stubble before wind.
083:014 As a fire doth burn a forest, And as a flame setteth hills on fire,
083:015 So dost Thou pursue them with Thy whirlwind, And with Thy hurricane troublest them.
083:016 Fill their faces with shame, And they seek Thy name, O Jehovah.
083:017 They are ashamed and troubled for ever, Yea, they are confounded and lost.
083:018 And they know that Thou- (Thy name is Jehovah-by Thyself,) Art the Most High over all the earth!
084:001 ¶  How beloved Thy tabernacles, Jehovah of Hosts!
084:002 My soul desired, yea, it hath also been consumed, For the courts of Jehovah, My heart and my flesh cry aloud unto the living God,
084:003 (Even a sparrow hath found a house, And a swallow a nest for herself, Where she hath placed her brood,) Thine altars, O Jehovah of Hosts, My king and my God.
084:004 O the happiness of those inhabiting Thy house, Yet do they praise Thee. Selah.
084:005 O the happiness of a man whose strength is in Thee, Highways are in their heart.
084:006 Those passing through a valley of weeping, A fountain do make it, Blessings also cover the director.
084:007 They go from strength unto strength, He appeareth unto God in Zion.
084:008 O Jehovah, God of Hosts, hear my prayer, Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
084:009 Our shield, see, O God, And behold the face of Thine anointed,
084:010 For good is a day in Thy courts, O Teacher! I have chosen rather to be at the threshold, In the house of my God, Than to dwell in tents of wickedness.
084:011 For a sun and a shield is Jehovah God, Grace and honour doth Jehovah give. He withholdeth not good To those walking in uprightness.
084:012 Jehovah of Hosts! O the happiness of a man trusting in Thee.
085:001 ¶  Thou hast accepted, O Jehovah, Thy land, Thou hast turned to the captivity of Jacob.
085:002 Thou hast borne away the iniquity of Thy people, Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
085:003 Thou hast gathered up all Thy wrath, Thou hast turned back from the fierceness of Thine anger.
085:004 Turn back to us, O God of our salvation, And make void Thine anger with us.
085:005 To the age art Thou angry against us? Dost Thou draw out Thine anger To generation and generation?
085:006 Dost Thou not turn back? Thou revivest us, And Thy people do rejoice in Thee.
085:007 Show us, O Jehovah, thy kindness, And Thy salvation Thou dost give to us.
085:008 I hear what God Jehovah speaketh, For He speaketh peace unto His people, And unto His saints, and they turn not back to folly.
085:009 Only, near to those fearing Him is His salvation, That honour may dwell in our land.
085:010 Kindness and truth have met, Righteousness and peace have kissed,
085:011 Truth from the earth springeth up, And righteousness from heaven looketh out,
085:012 Jehovah also giveth that which is good, And our land doth give its increase.
085:013 Righteousness before Him goeth, And maketh His footsteps for a way!
086:001 ¶  Incline, O Jehovah, Thine ear, Answer me, for I am poor and needy.
086:002 Keep my soul, for I am pious, Save Thy servant-who is trusting to Thee, O Thou, my God.
086:003 Favour me, O Lord, for to Thee I call all the day.
086:004 Rejoice the soul of Thy servant, For unto Thee, O Lord, my soul I lift up.
086:005 For Thou, Lord, art good and forgiving. And abundant in kindness to all calling Thee.
086:006 Hear, O Jehovah, my prayer, And attend to the voice of my supplications.
086:007 In a day of my distress I call Thee, For Thou dost answer me.
086:008 There is none like Thee among the gods, O Lord, And like Thy works there are none.
086:009 All nations that Thou hast made Come and bow themselves before Thee, O Lord, And give honour to Thy name.
086:010 For great art Thou, and doing wonders, Thou art God Thyself alone.
086:011 Show me, O Jehovah, Thy way, I walk in Thy truth, My heart doth rejoice to fear Thy name.
086:012 I confess Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And I honour Thy name to the age.
086:013 For Thy kindness is great toward me, And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
086:014 O God, the proud have risen up against me, And a company of the terrible sought my soul, And have not placed Thee before them,
086:015 And Thou, O Lord, art God, merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth.
086:016 Look unto me, and favour me, Give Thy strength to Thy servant, And give salvation to a son of Thine handmaid.
086:017 Do with me a sign for good, And those hating me see and are ashamed, For Thou, O Jehovah, hast helped me, Yea, Thou hast comforted me!
087:001 ¶  His foundation is in holy mountains.
087:002 Jehovah is loving the gates of Zion Above all the tabernacles of Jacob.
087:003 Honourable things are spoken in Thee, O city of God. Selah.
087:004 I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This one was born there.
087:005 And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, And He, the Most High, doth establish her.
087:006 Jehovah doth recount in the describing of the peoples, ‘This one was born there.’ Selah.
087:007 Singers also as players on instruments, All my fountains are in Thee!
088:001 ¶  O Jehovah, God of my salvation, Daily I have cried, nightly before Thee,
088:002 My prayer cometh in before Thee, Incline Thine ear to my loud cry,
088:003 For my soul hath been full of evils, And my life hath come to Sheol.
088:004 I have been reckoned with those going down to the pit, I have been as a man without strength.
088:005 Among the dead-free, As pierced ones lying in the grave, Whom Thou hast not remembered any more, Yea, they by Thy hand have been cut off.
088:006 Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in depths.
088:007 Upon me hath Thy fury lain, And with all Thy breakers Thou hast afflicted. Selah.
088:008 Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me, Thou hast made me an abomination to them, Shut up-I go not forth.
088:009 Mine eye hath grieved because of affliction, I called Thee, O Jehovah, all the day, I have spread out unto Thee my hands.
088:010 To the dead dost Thou do wonders? Do Rephaim rise? do they thank Thee? Selah.
088:011 Is Thy kindness recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness in destruction?
088:012 Are Thy wonders known in the darkness? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
088:013 And I, unto Thee, O Jehovah, I have cried, And in the morning doth my prayer come before Thee.
088:014 Why, O Jehovah, castest Thou off my soul? Thou hidest Thy face from me.
088:015 I am afflicted, and expiring from youth, I have borne Thy terrors-I pine away.
088:016 Over me hath Thy wrath passed, Thy terrors have cut me off,
088:017 They have surrounded me as waters all the day, They have gone round against me together,
088:018 Thou hast put far from me lover and friend, Mine acquaintance is the place of darkness!
089:001 ¶  Of the kind acts of Jehovah, to the age I sing, To all generations I make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth,
089:002 For I said, ‘To the age is kindness built, The heavens! Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness in them.’
089:003 I have made a covenant for My chosen, I have sworn to David My servant:
089:004 ‘Even to the age do I establish thy seed, And have built to generation and generation thy throne. Selah.
089:005 and the heavens confess Thy wonders, O Jehovah, Thy faithfulness also is in an assembly of holy ones.
089:006 For who in the sky, Compareth himself to Jehovah? Is like to Jehovah among sons of the mighty?
089:007 God is very terrible, In the secret counsel of His holy ones, And fearful over all surrounding Him.
089:008 O Jehovah, God of Hosts, Who is like Thee-a strong Jah? And Thy faithfulness is round about Thee.
089:009 Thou art ruler over the pride of the sea, In the lifting up of its billows Thou dost restrain them.
089:010 Thou hast bruised Rahab, as one wounded. With the arm of Thy strength Thou hast scattered Thine enemies.
089:011 Thine are the heavens-the earth also is Thine, The habitable world and its fulness, Thou hast founded them.
089:012 North and south Thou hast appointed them, Tabor and Hermon in Thy name do sing.
089:013 Thou hast an arm with might, Strong is Thy hand-high Thy right hand.
089:014 Righteousness and judgment Are the fixed place of Thy throne, Kindness and truth go before Thy face.
089:015 O the happiness of the people knowing the shout, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy face they walk habitually.
089:016 In Thy name they rejoice all the day, And in Thy righteousness they are exalted,
089:017 For the beauty of their strength art Thou, And in Thy good will is our horn exalted,
089:018 For of Jehovah is our shield, And of the Holy One of Israel our king.
089:019 Then Thou hast spoken in vision, To Thy saint, yea, Thou sayest, I have placed help upon a mighty one, Exalted a chosen one out of the people,
089:020 I have found David My servant, With My holy oil I have anointed him.
089:021 With whom My hand is established, My arm also doth strengthen him.
089:022 An enemy exacteth not upon him, And a son of perverseness afflicteth him not.
089:023 And I have beaten down before him his adversaries, And those hating him I plague,
089:024 And My faithfulness and kindness are with him, And in My name is his horn exalted.
089:025 And I have set on the sea his hand, And on the rivers his right hand.
089:026 He proclaimeth me: ‘Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.’
089:027 I also first-born do appoint him, Highest of the kings of the earth.
089:028 To the age I keep for him My kindness, And My covenant is stedfast with him.
089:029 And I have set his seed for ever, And his throne as the days of the heavens.
089:030 If his sons forsake My law, And in My judgments do not walk;
089:031 If My statutes they pollute, And My commands do not keep,
089:032 I have looked after with a rod their transgression, And with strokes their iniquity,
089:033 And My kindness I break not from him, Nor do I deal falsely in My faithfulness.
089:034 I profane not My covenant, And that which is going forth from My lips I change not.
089:035 Once I have sworn by My holiness, I lie not to David,
089:036 His seed is to the age, And his throne is as the sun before Me,
089:037 As the moon it is established-to the age, And the witness in the sky is stedfast. Selah.
089:038 And Thou, Thou hast cast off, and dost reject, Thou hast shown Thyself wroth With Thine anointed,
089:039 Hast rejected the covenant of Thy servant, Thou hast polluted to the earth his crown,
089:040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges, Thou hast made his fenced places a ruin.
089:041 Spoiled him have all passing by the way, He hath been a reproach to his neighbours,
089:042 Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries, Thou hast caused all his enemies to rejoice.
089:043 Also-Thou turnest back the sharpness of his sword, And hast not established him in battle,
089:044 Hast caused him to cease from his brightness, And his throne to the earth hast cast down.
089:045 Thou hast shortened the days of his youth, Hast covered him over with shame. Selah.
089:046 Till when, O Jehovah, art Thou hidden? For ever doth Thy fury burn as fire?
089:047 Remember, I pray Thee, what is life-time? Wherefore in vain hast Thou created All the sons of men?
089:048 Who is the man that liveth, and doth not see death? He delivereth his soul from the hand of Sheol. Selah.
089:049 Where are Thy former kindnesses, O Lord. Thou hast sworn to David in Thy faithfulness,
089:050 Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, I have borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples,
089:051 Wherewith Thine enemies reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached The steps of Thine anointed.
089:052 Blessed is Jehovah to the age. Amen, and amen!
090:001 ¶  Lord, a habitation Thou-Thou hast been, To us-in generation and generation,
090:002 Before mountains were brought forth, And Thou dost form the earth and the world, Even from age unto age Thou art God.
090:003 Thou turnest man unto a bruised thing, And sayest, Turn back, ye sons of men.
090:004 For a thousand years in Thine eyes are as yesterday, For it passeth on, yea, a watch by night.
090:005 Thou hast inundated them, they are asleep, In the morning as grass he changeth.
090:006 In the morning it flourisheth, and hath changed, At evening it is cut down, and hath withered.
090:007 For we were consumed in Thine anger, And in Thy fury we have been troubled.
090:008 Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our hidden things at the light of Thy face,
090:009 For all our days pined away in Thy wrath, We consumed our years as a meditation.
090:010 Days of our years, in them are seventy years, And if, by reason of might, eighty years, Yet is their enlargement labour and vanity, For it hath been cut off hastily, and we fly away.
090:011 Who knoweth the power of Thine anger? And according to Thy fear-Thy wrath?
090:012 To number our days aright let us know, And we bring the heart to wisdom.
090:013 Turn back, O Jehovah, till when? And repent concerning Thy servants.
090:014 Satisfy us at morn with Thy kindness, And we sing and rejoice all our days.
090:015 Cause us to rejoice according to the days Wherein Thou hast afflicted us, The years we have seen evil.
090:016 Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants, And Thine honour on their sons.
090:017 And let the pleasantness of Jehovah our God be upon us, And the work of our hands establish on us, Yea, the work of our hands establish it!
091:001 ¶  He who is dwelling In the secret place of the Most High, In the shade of the Mighty lodgeth habitually,
091:002 He is saying of Jehovah, ‘My refuge, and my bulwark, my God, I trust in Him,’
091:003 For He delivereth thee from the snare of a fowler, From a calamitous pestilence.
091:004 With His pinion He covereth thee over, And under His wings thou dost trust, A shield and buckler is His truth.
091:005 Thou art not afraid of fear by night, Of arrow that flieth by day,
091:006 Of pestilence in thick darkness that walketh, Of destruction that destroyeth at noon,
091:007 There fall at thy side a thousand, And a myriad at thy right hand, Unto thee it cometh not nigh.
091:008 But with thine eyes thou lookest, And the reward of the wicked thou seest,
091:009 (For Thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge,) The Most High thou madest thy habitation.
091:010 Evil happeneth not unto thee, And a plague cometh not near thy tent,
091:011 For His messengers He chargeth for thee, To keep thee in all thy ways,
091:012 On the hands they bear thee up, Lest thou smite against a stone thy foot.
091:013 On lion and asp thou treadest, Thou trampest young lion and dragon.
091:014 Because in Me he hath delighted, I also deliver him-I set him on high, Because he hath known My name.
091:015 He doth call Me, and I answer him, I am with him in distress, I deliver him, and honour him.
091:016 With length of days I satisfy him, And I cause him to look on My salvation!
092:001 ¶  Good to give thanks to Jehovah, And to sing praises to Thy name, O Most High,
092:002 To declare in the morning Thy kindness, And Thy faithfulness in the nights.
092:003 On ten strings and on psaltery, On higgaion, with harp.
092:004 For Thou hast caused me to rejoice, O Jehovah, in Thy work, Concerning the works of Thy hands I sing.
092:005 How great have been Thy works, O Jehovah, Very deep have been Thy thoughts.
092:006 A brutish man doth not know, And a fool understandeth not this;-
092:007 When the wicked flourish as a herb, And blossom do all workers of iniquity- For their being destroyed for ever and ever!
092:008 And Thou art high to the age, O Jehovah.
092:009 For, lo, Thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, Thine enemies, do perish, Separate themselves do all workers of iniquity.
092:010 And Thou exaltest as a reem my horn, I have been anointed with fresh oil.
092:011 And mine eye looketh on mine enemies, Of those rising up against me, The evil doers, do mine ears hear.
092:012 The righteous as a palm-tree flourisheth, As a cedar in Lebanon he groweth.
092:013 Those planted in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of our God do flourish.
092:014 Still they bring forth in old age, Fat and flourishing are they,
092:015 To declare that upright is Jehovah my rock, And there is no perverseness in Him!
093:001 ¶  Jehovah hath reigned, Excellency He hath put on, Jehovah put on strength, He girded Himself, Also-established is the world, unmoved.
093:002 Established is Thy throne since then, From the age Thou art.
093:003 Floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, Floods have lifted up their voice, Floods lift up their breakers.
093:004 Than the voices of many mighty waters, Breakers of a sea, mighty on high is Jehovah,
093:005 Thy testimonies have been very stedfast, To Thy house comely is holiness, O Jehovah, for length of days!
094:001 ¶  God of vengeance-Jehovah! God of vengeance, shine forth.
094:002 Be lifted up, O Judge of the earth, Send back a recompence on the proud.
094:003 Till when do the wicked, O Jehovah? Till when do the wicked exult?
094:004 They utter-they speak an old saw, All working iniquity do boast themselves.
094:005 Thy people, O Jehovah, they bruise, And Thine inheritance they afflict.
094:006 Widow and sojourner they slay, And fatherless ones they murder.
094:007 And they say, ‘Jehovah doth not see, And the God of Jacob doth not consider.’
094:008 Consider, ye brutish among the people, And ye foolish, when do ye act wisely?
094:009 He who planteth the ear doth He not hear? He who formeth the eye doth He not see?
094:010 He who is instructing nations, Doth He not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge is Jehovah.
094:011 He knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
094:012 O the happiness of the man Whom Thou instructest, O Jah, And out of Thy law teachest him,
094:013 To give rest to him from days of evil, While a pit is digged for the wicked.
094:014 For Jehovah leaveth not His people, And His inheritance forsaketh not.
094:015 For to righteousness judgment turneth back, And after it all the upright of heart,
094:016 Who riseth up for me with evil doers? Who stationeth himself for me with workers of iniquity?
094:017 Unless Jehovah were a help to me, My soul had almost inhabited silence.
094:018 If I have said, ‘My foot hath slipped,’ Thy kindness, O Jehovah, supporteth me.
094:019 In the abundance of my thoughts within me, Thy comforts delight my soul.
094:020 Is a throne of mischief joined with Thee? A framer of perverseness by statute?
094:021 They decree against the soul of the righteous, And innocent blood declare wicked.
094:022 And Jehovah is for a high place to me, And my God is for a rock-my refuge,
094:023 And turneth back on them their iniquity, And in their wickedness cutteth them off; Jehovah our God doth cut them off!
095:001 ¶  Come, we sing to Jehovah, We shout to the rock of our salvation.
095:002 We come before His face with thanksgiving, With psalms we shout to Him.
095:003 For a great God is Jehovah, And a great king over all gods.
095:004 In whose hand are the deep places of earth, And the strong places of hills are His.
095:005 Whose is the sea, and He made it, And His hands formed the dry land.
095:006 Come in, we bow ourselves, and we bend, We kneel before Jehovah our Maker.
095:007 For He is our God, and we the people of His pasture, And the flock of His hand, To-day, if to His voice ye hearken,
095:008 Harden not your heart as in Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
095:009 Where your fathers have tried Me, Have proved Me, yea, have seen My work.
095:010 Forty years I am weary of the generation, And I say, ‘A people erring in heart-they! And they have not known My ways:’
095:011 Where I sware in Mine anger, ‘If they come in unto My rest-!’
096:001 ¶  Sing to Jehovah a new song, Sing to Jehovah all the earth.
096:002 Sing to Jehovah, bless His name, Proclaim from day to day His salvation.
096:003 Declare among nations His honour, Among all the peoples His wonders.
096:004 For great is Jehovah, and praised greatly, Fearful He is over all gods.
096:005 For all the gods of the peoples are nought, And Jehovah made the heavens.
096:006 Honour and majesty are before Him, Strength and beauty in His sanctuary.
096:007 Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.
096:008 Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present and come in to His courts.
096:009 Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the honour of holiness, Be afraid of His presence, all the earth.
096:010 Say among nations, ‘Jehovah hath reigned, Also-established is the world, unmoved, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.’
096:011 The heavens joy, and the earth is joyful, The sea and its fulness roar.
096:012 The field exulteth, and all that is in it, Then sing do all trees of the forest,
096:013 Before Jehovah, for He hath come, For He hath come to judge the earth. He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the peoples in His faithfulness!
097:001 ¶  Jehovah hath reigned, The earth is joyful, many isles rejoice.
097:002 Cloud and darkness are round about Him, Righteousness and judgment the basis of His throne.
097:003 Fire before Him goeth, And burneth round about His adversaries.
097:004 Lightened have His lightnings the world, The earth hath seen, and is pained.
097:005 Hills, like wax, melted before Jehovah, Before the Lord of all the earth.
097:006 The heavens declared His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His honour.
097:007 Ashamed are all servants of a graven image, Those boasting themselves in idols, Bow yourselves to him, all ye gods.
097:008 Zion hath heard and rejoiceth, And daughters of Judah are joyful, Because of Thy judgments, O Jehovah.
097:009 For Thou, Jehovah, art Most High over all the earth, Greatly Thou hast been exalted over all gods.
097:010 Ye who love Jehovah, hate evil, He is keeping the souls of His saints, From the hand of the wicked he delivereth them.
097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, And for the upright of heart-joy.
097:012 Rejoice, ye righteous, in Jehovah, And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness!
098:001 ¶  Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, For wonders He hath done, Given salvation to Him hath His right hand and His holy arm.
098:002 Jehovah hath made known His salvation, Before the eyes of the nations, He hath revealed His righteousness,
098:003 He hath remembered His kindness, And His faithfulness to the house of Israel, All ends of earth have seen the salvation of our God.
098:004 Shout to Jehovah, all the earth, Break forth, and cry aloud, and sing.
098:005 Sing to Jehovah with harp, With harp, and voice of praise,
098:006 With trumpets, and voice of a cornet, Shout ye before the king Jehovah.
098:007 Roar doth the sea and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.
098:008 Floods clap hand, together hills cry aloud,
098:009 Before Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth, He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the people in uprightness!
099:001 ¶  Jehovah hath reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.
099:002 Jehovah in Zion is great, And high He is over all the peoples.
099:003 They praise Thy name, ‘Great, and fearful, holy it is.’
099:004 And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, Thou-Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, Thou-Thou hast done.
099:005 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy is He.
099:006 Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Jehovah, And He doth answer them.
099:007 In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to them.
099:008 O Jehovah, our God, Thou hast afflicted them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions.
099:009 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy is Jehovah our God!
100:001 ¶  Shout to Jehovah, all the earth.
100:002 Serve Jehovah with joy, come before him with singing.
100:003 Know that Jehovah He is God, He made us, and we are His, His people-and the flock of His pasture.
100:004 Enter ye His gates with thanksgiving, His courts with praise, Give ye thanks to Him, bless ye His Name.
100:005 For good is Jehovah, to the age His kindness, And to generation and generation His faithfulness!
101:001 ¶  Kindness and judgment I sing, To Thee, O Jehovah, I sing praise.
101:002 I act wisely in a perfect way, When dost Thou come in unto me? I walk habitually in the integrity of my heart, In the midst of my house.
101:003 I set not before mine eyes a worthless thing, The work of those turning aside I have hated, It adhereth not to me.
101:004 A perverse heart turneth aside from me, Wickedness I know not.
101:005 Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbour, Him I cut off, The high of eyes and proud of heart, him I endure not.
101:006 Mine eyes are on the faithful of the land, To dwell with me, Whoso is walking in a perfect way, he serveth me.
101:007 He dwelleth not in my house who is working deceit, Whoso is speaking lies Is not established before mine eyes.
101:008 At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land, To cut off from the city of Jehovah All the workers of iniquity!
102:001 ¶  O Jehovah, hear my prayer, yea, my cry to Thee cometh.
102:002 Hide not Thou Thy face from me, In a day of mine adversity, Incline unto me Thine ear, In the day I call, haste, answer me.
102:003 For consumed in smoke have been my days, And my bones as a fire-brand have burned.
102:004 Smitten as the herb, and withered, is my heart, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.
102:005 From the voice of my sighing Hath my bone cleaved to my flesh.
102:006 I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness, I have been as an owl of the dry places.
102:007 I have watched, and I am As a bird alone on the roof.
102:008 All the day mine enemies reproached me, Those mad at me have sworn against me.
102:009 Because ashes as bread I have eaten, And my drink with weeping have mingled,
102:010 From Thine indignation and Thy wrath, For Thou hast lifted me up, And dost cast me down.
102:011 My days as a shadow are stretched out, And I-as the herb I am withered.
102:012 And Thou, O Jehovah, to the age abidest, And Thy memorial to all generations.
102:013 Thou-Thou risest-Thou pitiest Zion, For the time to favour her, For the appointed time hath come.
102:014 For Thy servants have been pleased with her stones, And her dust they favour.
102:015 And nations fear the name of Jehovah, And all kings of the earth Thine honour,
102:016 For Jehovah hath builded Zion, He hath been seen in His honour,
102:017 He turned unto the prayer of the destitute, And He hath not despised their prayer.
102:018 This is written for a later generation, And the people created do praise Jah.
102:019 For He hath looked From the high place of His sanctuary. Jehovah from heaven unto earth looked attentively,
102:020 To hear the groan of the prisoner, To loose sons of death,
102:021 To declare in Zion the name of Jehovah, And His praise in Jerusalem,
102:022 In the peoples being gathered together, And the kingdoms-to serve Jehovah.
102:023 He hath humbled in the way my power, He hath shortened my days.
102:024 I say, ‘My God, take me not up in the midst of my days,’ Through all generations are Thine years.
102:025 Beforetime the earth Thou didst found, And the work of Thy hands are the heavens.
102:026 They-They perish, and Thou remainest, And all of them as a garment become old, As clothing Thou changest them, And they are changed.
102:027 And Thou art the same, and Thine years are not finished.
102:028 The sons of Thy servants do continue, And their seed before Thee is established!
103:001 ¶  Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And all my inward parts-His Holy Name.
103:002 Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And forget not all His benefits,
103:003 Who is forgiving all thine iniquities, Who is healing all thy diseases,
103:004 Who is redeeming from destruction thy life, Who is crowning thee-kindness and mercies,
103:005 Who is satisfying with good thy desire, Renew itself as an eagle doth thy youth.
103:006 Jehovah is doing righteousness and judgments For all the oppressed.
103:007 He maketh known His ways to Moses, To the sons of Israel His acts.
103:008 Merciful and gracious is Jehovah, Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.
103:009 Not for ever doth He strive, Nor to the age doth He watch.
103:010 Not according to our sins hath He done to us, Nor according to our iniquities Hath He conferred benefits upon us.
103:011 For, as the height of the heavens is above the earth, His kindness hath been mighty over those fearing Him.
103:012 As the distance of east from west He hath put far from us our transgressions.
103:013 As a father hath mercy on sons, Jehovah hath mercy on those fearing Him.
103:014 For He hath known our frame, Remembering that we are dust.
103:015 Mortal man! as grass are his days, As a flower of the field so he flourisheth;
103:016 For a wind hath passed over it, and it is not, And its place doth not discern it any more.
103:017 And the kindness of Jehovah Is from age even unto age on those fearing Him, And His righteousness to sons’ sons,
103:018 To those keeping His covenant, And to those remembering His precepts to do them.
103:019 Jehovah in the heavens Hath established His throne, And His kingdom over all hath ruled.
103:020 Bless Jehovah, ye His messengers, Mighty in power-doing His word, To hearken to the voice of His Word.
103:021 Bless Jehovah, all ye His hosts, His ministers-doing His pleasure.
103:022 Bless Jehovah, all ye His works, In all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah!
104:001 ¶  Bless, O my soul, Jehovah! Jehovah, my God, Thou hast been very great, Honour and majesty Thou hast put on.
104:002 Covering himself with light as a garment, Stretching out the heavens as a curtain,
104:003 Who is laying the beam of His upper chambers in the waters, Who is making thick clouds His chariot, Who is walking on wings of wind,
104:004 Making His messengers-the winds, His ministers-the flaming fire.
104:005 He hath founded earth on its bases, It is not moved to the age and for ever.
104:006 The abyss! as with clothing Thou hast covered it, Above hills do waters stand.
104:007 From Thy rebuke they flee, From the voice of Thy thunder haste away.
104:008 They go up hills-they go down valleys, Unto a place Thou hast founded for them.
104:009 A border Thou hast set, they pass not over, They turn not back to cover the earth.
104:010 Who is sending forth fountains in valleys, Between hills they go on.
104:011 They water every beast of the field, Wild asses break their thirst.
104:012 By them the fowl of the heavens doth dwell, From between the branches They give forth the voice.
104:013 Watering hills from His upper chambers, From the fruit of Thy works is the earth satisfied.
104:014 Causing grass to spring up for cattle, And herb for the service of man, To bring forth bread from the earth,
104:015 And wine-it rejoiceth the heart of man, To cause the face to shine from oil, And bread-the heart of man it supporteth.
104:016 Satisfied are the trees of Jehovah, Cedars of Lebanon that He hath planted,
104:017 Where birds do make nests, The stork-the firs are her house.
104:018 The high hills are for wild goats, Rocks are a refuge for conies,
104:019 He made the moon for seasons, The sun hath known his place of entrance.
104:020 Thou settest darkness, and it is night, In it doth every beast of the forest creep.
104:021 The young lions are roaring for prey, And to seek from God their food.
104:022 The sun riseth, they are gathered, And in their dens they crouch.
104:023 Man goeth forth to his work, And to his service-till evening.
104:024 How many have been Thy works, O Jehovah, All of them in wisdom Thou hast made, Full is the earth of thy possessions.
104:025 This, the sea, great and broad of sides, There are moving things-innumerable, Living creatures-small with great.
104:026 There do ships go: leviathan, That Thou hast formed to play in it.
104:027 All of them unto Thee do look, To give their food in its season.
104:028 Thou dost give to them-they gather, Thou dost open Thy hand-they are satisfied with good.
104:029 Thou hidest Thy face-they are troubled, Thou gatherest their spirit-they expire, And unto their dust they turn back.
104:030 Thou sendest out Thy Spirit, they are created, And Thou renewest the face of the ground.
104:031 The honour of Jehovah is to the age, Jehovah rejoiceth in His works,
104:032 Who is looking to earth, and it trembleth, He cometh against hills, and they smoke.
104:033 I sing to Jehovah during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.
104:034 Sweet is my meditation on Him, I-I do rejoice in Jehovah.
104:035 Consumed are sinners from the earth, And the wicked are no more. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah!
105:001 ¶  Give ye thanks to Jehovah-call ye in His name, Make known among the peoples His acts.
105:002 Sing ye to Him-sing praise to Him, Meditate ye on all His wonders.
105:003 Boast yourselves in His Holy Name, The heart of those seeking Jehovah rejoiceth.
105:004 Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek ye His face continually.
105:005 Remember His wonders that He did, His signs and the judgments of His mouth.
105:006 O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
105:007 He is Jehovah our God, In all the earth are His judgments.
105:008 He hath remembered to the age His covenant, The word He commanded to a thousand generations,
105:009 That He hath made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac,
105:010 And doth establish it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel-a covenant age-during,
105:011 Saying, ‘To thee I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,’
105:012 In their being few in number, But a few, and sojourners in it.
105:013 And they go up and down, from nation unto nation, From a kingdom unto another people.
105:014 He hath not suffered any to oppress them And He reproveth for their sakes kings.
105:015 ‘Strike not against Mine anointed, And to My prophets do not evil.’
105:016 And He calleth a famine on the land, The whole staff of bread He hath broken.
105:017 He hath sent before them a man, For a servant hath Joseph been sold.
105:018 They have afflicted with fetters his feet, Iron hath entered his soul,
105:019 Till the time of the coming of His word The saying of Jehovah hath tried him.
105:020 The king hath sent, and looseth him, The ruler of the peoples, and draweth him out.
105:021 He hath made him lord of his house, And ruler over all his possessions.
105:022 To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, And his elders he maketh wise.
105:023 And Israel cometh in to Egypt, And Jacob hath sojourned in the land of Ham.
105:024 And He maketh His people very fruitful, And maketh it mightier than its adversaries.
105:025 He turned their heart to hate His people, To conspire against His servants.
105:026 He hath sent Moses His servant, Aaron whom He had fixed on.
105:027 They have set among them the matters of His signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.
105:028 He hath sent darkness, and it is dark, And they have not provoked His word.
105:029 He hath turned their waters to blood, And putteth to death their fish.
105:030 Teemed hath their land with frogs, In the inner chambers of their kings.
105:031 He hath said, and the beetle cometh, Lice into all their border.
105:032 He hath made their showers hail, A flaming fire is in their land.
105:033 And He smiteth their vine and their fig, And shivereth the trees of their border.
105:034 He hath said, and the locust cometh, And the cankerworm-innumerable,
105:035 And it consumeth every herb in their land, And it consumeth the fruit of their ground.
105:036 And He smiteth every first-born in their land, The first-fruit of all their strength,
105:037 And bringeth them out with silver and gold, And there is not in its tribes a feeble one.
105:038 Rejoiced hath Egypt in their going forth, For their fear had fallen upon them.
105:039 He hath spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to enlighten the night.
105:040 They have asked, and He bringeth quails, And with bread of heaven satisfieth them.
105:041 He hath opened a rock, and waters issue, They have gone on in dry places-a river.
105:042 For He hath remembered His holy word, With Abraham His servant,
105:043 And He bringeth forth His people with joy, With singing His chosen ones.
105:044 And He giveth to them the lands of nations, And the labour of peoples they possess,
105:045 That they may observe His statutes, And His laws may keep. Praise ye Jehovah!
106:001 ¶  Praise ye Jah, give thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age, is His kindness.
106:002 Who doth utter the mighty acts of Jehovah? Soundeth all His praise?
106:003 O the happiness of those keeping judgment, Doing righteousness at all times.
106:004 Remember me, O Jehovah, With the favour of Thy people, Look after me in Thy salvation.
106:005 To look on the good of Thy chosen ones, To rejoice in the joy of Thy nation, To boast myself with Thine inheritance.
106:006 We have sinned with our fathers, We have done perversely, we have done wickedly.
106:007 Our fathers in Egypt, Have not considered wisely Thy wonders, They have not remembered The abundance of Thy kind acts, And provoke by the sea, at the sea of Suph.
106:008 And He saveth them for His name’s sake, To make known His might,
106:009 And rebuketh the sea of Suph, and it is dried up, And causeth them to go Through depths as a wilderness.
106:010 And He saveth them from the hand Of him who is hating, And redeemeth them from the hand of the enemy.
106:011 And waters cover their adversaries, One of them hath not been left.
106:012 And they believe in His words, they sing His praise,
106:013 They have hasted-forgotten His works, They have not waited for His counsel.
106:014 And they lust greatly in a wilderness, And try God in a desert.
106:015 And He giveth to them their request, And sendeth leanness into their soul.
106:016 And they are envious of Moses in the camp, Of Aaron, Jehovah’s holy one.
106:017 Earth openeth, and swalloweth up Dathan, And covereth over the company of Abiram.
106:018 And fire burneth among their company, A flame setteth on fire the wicked.
106:019 They make a calf in Horeb, And bow themselves to a molten image,
106:020 And change their Honour Into the form of an ox eating herbs.
106:021 They have forgotten God their saviour, The doer of great things in Egypt,
106:022 Of wonderful things in the land of Ham, Of fearful things by the sea of Suph.
106:023 And He saith to destroy them, Unless Moses, His chosen one, Had stood in the breach before Him, To turn back His wrath from destroying.
106:024 And they kick against the desirable land, They have not given credence to His word.
106:025 And they murmur in their tents, They have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah.
106:026 And He lifteth up His hand to them, To cause them to fall in a wilderness,
106:027 And to cause their seed to fall among nations, And to scatter them through lands.
106:028 And they are coupled to Baal-Peor, And eat the sacrifices of the dead,
106:029 And they provoke to anger by their actions, And a plague breaketh forth upon them,
106:030 And Phinehas standeth, and executeth judgment And the plague is restrained,
106:031 And it is reckoned to him to righteousness, To all generations-unto the age.
106:032 And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah, And it is evil to Moses for their sakes,
106:033 For they have provoked his spirit, And he speaketh wrongfully with his lips.
106:034 They have not destroyed the peoples, As Jehovah had said to them,
106:035 And mix themselves among nations, and learn their works,
106:036 And serve their idols, And they are to them for a snare.
106:037 And they sacrifice their sons And their daughters to destroyers,
106:038 And they shed innocent blood- Blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they have sacrificed to idols of Canaan, And the land is profaned with blood.
106:039 And they are defiled with their works, And commit whoredom in their habitual doings.
106:040 And the anger of Jehovah Is kindled against His people, And He doth abominate His inheritance.
106:041 And giveth them into the hand of nations, And those hating them rule over them,
106:042 And their enemies oppress them, And they are humbled under their hand.
106:043 Many times He doth deliver them, And they rebel in their counsel, And they are brought low in their iniquity.
106:044 And He looketh on their distress When He heareth their cry,
106:045 And remembereth for them His covenant, And is comforted, According to the abundance of His kindness.
106:046 And He appointeth them for mercies Before all their captors.
106:047 Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To glory in Thy praise.
106:048 Blessed is Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age even unto the age. And all the people said, ‘Amen, praise Jah!’
107:001 ¶  ‘Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age is His kindness:’
107:002 Let the redeemed of Jehovah say, Whom He redeemed from the hand of an adversary.
107:003 And from the lands hath gathered them, From east and from west, From north, and from the sea.
107:004 They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, A city of habitation they have not found.
107:005 Hungry-yea-thirsty, Their soul in them becometh feeble,
107:006 And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distress He delivereth them,
107:007 And causeth them to tread in a right way, To go unto a city of habitation.
107:008 They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.
107:009 For He hath satisfied a longing soul, And a hungry soul hath filled with goodness.
107:010 Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, Prisoners of affliction and of iron,
107:011 Because they changed the saying of God, And the counsel of the Most High despised.
107:012 And He humbleth with labour their heart, They have been feeble, and there is no helper.
107:013 And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them.
107:014 He bringeth them out from the dark place, And death-shade, And their bands He draweth away.
107:015 They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.
107:016 For He hath broken doors of brass, And bars of iron He hath cut.
107:017 Fools, by means of their transgression, And by their iniquities, afflict themselves.
107:018 All food doth their soul abominate, And they come nigh unto the gates of death,
107:019 And cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them,
107:020 He sendeth His word and healeth them, And delivereth from their destructions.
107:021 They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,
107:022 And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, And recount His works with singing.
107:023 Those going down to the sea in ships, Doing business in many waters,
107:024 They have seen the works of Jehovah, And His wonders in the deep.
107:025 And He saith, and appointeth a tempest, And it lifteth up its billows,
107:026 They go up to the heavens, they go down to the depths, Their soul in evil is melted.
107:027 They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.
107:028 And they cry to Jehovah in their adversity, And from their distresses He bringeth them out.
107:029 He establisheth a whirlwind to a calm, And hushed are their billows.
107:030 And they rejoice because they are quiet, And He leadeth them to the haven of their desire.
107:031 They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,
107:032 And they exalt Him in the assembly of the people, And in the seat of the elders praise Him.
107:033 He maketh rivers become a wilderness, And fountains of waters become dry land.
107:034 A fruitful land becometh a barren place, For the wickedness of its inhabitants.
107:035 He maketh a wilderness become a pool of water, And a dry land become fountains of waters.
107:036 And He causeth the hungry to dwell there, And they prepare a city of habitation.
107:037 And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.
107:038 And He blesseth them, and they multiply exceedingly, And their cattle He doth not diminish.
107:039 And they are diminished, and bow down, By restraint, evil, and sorrow.
107:040 He is pouring contempt upon nobles, And causeth them to wander in vacancy-no way.
107:041 And setteth on high the needy from affliction, And placeth families as a flock.
107:042 The upright do see and rejoice, And all perversity hath shut her mouth.
107:043 Who is wise, and observeth these? They understand the kind acts of Jehovah!
108:001 ¶  Prepared is my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour.
108:002 Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the dawn.
108:003 I thank Thee among peoples, O Jehovah, And I praise Thee among the nations.
108:004 For great above the heavens is Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.
108:005 Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, And above all the earth Thy honour.
108:006 That Thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save with Thy right hand, and answer us.
108:007 God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,
108:008 Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh, And Ephraim is the strength of my head, Judah is my lawgiver,
108:009 Moab is a pot for my washing, Upon Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually.
108:010 Who doth bring me in to the fenced city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
108:011 Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not out, O God, with our hosts!
108:012 Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the salvation of man.
108:013 In God we do mightily, And He doth tread down our adversaries!
109:001 ¶  O God of my praise, be not silent,
109:002 For the mouth of wickedness, and the mouth of deceit, Against me they have opened, They have spoken with me- A tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred!
109:003 They have compassed me about, And they fight me without cause.
109:004 For my love they oppose me, and I-prayer!
109:005 And they set against me evil for good, And hatred for my love.
109:006 Appoint Thou over him the wicked, And an adversary standeth at his right hand.
109:007 In his being judged, he goeth forth wicked, And his prayer is for sin.
109:008 His days are few, his oversight another taketh,
109:009 His sons are fatherless, and his wife a widow.
109:010 And wander continually do his sons, Yea, they have begged, And have sought out of their dry places.
109:011 An exactor layeth a snare for all that he hath, And strangers spoil his labour.
109:012 He hath none to extend kindness, Nor is there one showing favour to his orphans.
109:013 His posterity is for cutting off, In another generation is their name blotted out.
109:014 The iniquity of his fathers Is remembered unto Jehovah, And the sin of his mother is not blotted out.
109:015 They are before Jehovah continually, And He cutteth off from earth their memorial.
109:016 Because that he hath not remembered to do kindness, And pursueth the poor man and needy, And the smitten of heart-to slay,
109:017 And he loveth reviling, and it meeteth him, And he hath not delighted in blessing, And it is far from him.
109:018 And he putteth on reviling as his robe, And it cometh in as water into his midst, And as oil into his bones.
109:019 It is to him as apparel-he covereth himself, And for a continual girdle he girdeth it on.
109:020 This is the wage of mine accusers from Jehovah, And of those speaking evil against my soul.
109:021 And Thou, O Jehovah Lord, Deal with me for Thy name’s sake, Because Thy kindness is good, deliver me.
109:022 For I am poor and needy, And my heart hath been pierced in my midst.
109:023 As a shadow when it is stretched out I have gone, I have been driven away as a locust.
109:024 My knees have been feeble from fasting, And my flesh hath failed of fatness.
109:025 And I-I have been a reproach to them, They see me, they shake their head.
109:026 Help me, O Jehovah my God, Save me, according to Thy kindness.
109:027 And they know that this is Thy hand, Thou, O Jehovah, Thou hast done it.
109:028 They revile, and Thou dost bless, They have risen, and are ashamed, And Thy servant doth rejoice.
109:029 Mine accusers put on blushing, and are covered, As an upper robe is their shame.
109:030 I thank Jehovah greatly with my mouth, And in the midst of many I praise Him,
109:031 For He standeth at the right hand of the needy, To save from those judging his soul.
110:001 ¶  The affirmation of Jehovah to my Lord: ‘Sit at My right hand, Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.’
110:002 The rod of thy strength doth Jehovah send from Zion, Rule in the midst of thine enemies.
110:003 Thy people are free-will gifts in the day of Thy strength, in the honours of holiness, From the womb, from the morning, Thou hast the dew of thy youth.
110:004 Jehovah hath sworn, and doth not repent, ‘Thou art a priest to the age, According to the order of Melchizedek.’
110:005 The Lord on thy right hand smote kings In the day of His anger.
110:006 He doth judge among the nations, He hath completed the carcases, Hath smitten the head over the mighty earth.
110:007 From a brook in the way he drinketh, Therefore he doth lift up the head!
111:001 ¶  Praise ye Jah! I thank Jehovah with the whole heart, In the secret meeting of the upright, And of the company.
111:002 Great are the works of Jehovah, Sought out by all desiring them.
111:003 Honourable and majestic is His work, And His righteousness is standing for ever.
111:004 A memorial He hath made of His wonders, Gracious and merciful is Jehovah.
111:005 Prey He hath given to those fearing Him, He remembereth to the age His covenant.
111:006 The power of His works He hath declared to His people, To give to them the inheritance of nations.
111:007 The works of His hands are true and just, Stedfast are all His appointments.
111:008 They are sustained for ever to the age. They are made in truth and uprightness.
111:009 Redemption He hath sent to His people, He hath appointed to the age His covenant, Holy and fearful is His name.
111:010 The beginning of wisdom is fear of Jehovah, Good understanding have all doing them, His praise is standing for ever!
112:001 ¶  Praise ye Jah! O the happiness of one fearing Jehovah, In His commands he hath delighted greatly.
112:002 Mighty in the earth is his seed, The generation of the upright is blessed.
112:003 Wealth and riches are in his house, And his righteousness is standing for ever.
112:004 Light hath risen in darkness to the upright, Gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
112:005 Good is the man-gracious and lending, He sustaineth his matters in judgment.
112:006 For-to the age he is not moved; For a memorial age-during is the righteous.
112:007 Of an evil report he is not afraid, Prepared is His heart, confident in Jehovah.
112:008 Sustained is his heart-he feareth not, Till that he look on his adversaries.
112:009 He hath scattered-hath given to the needy, His righteousness is standing for ever, His horn is exalted with honour.
112:010 The wicked seeth, and hath been angry, His teeth he gnasheth, and hath melted, The desire of the wicked doth perish!
113:001 ¶  Praise ye Jah! Praise, ye servants of Jehovah. Praise the name of Jehovah.
113:002 The name of Jehovah is blessed, From henceforth, and unto the age.
113:003 From the rising of the sun unto its going in, Praised is the name of Jehovah.
113:004 High above all nations is Jehovah, Above the heavens is his honour.
113:005 Who is as Jehovah our God, He is exalting Himself to sit?
113:006 He is humbling Himself to look On the heavens and on the earth.
113:007 He is raising up from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He exalteth the needy.
113:008 To cause to sit with princes, With the princes of His people.
113:009 Causing the barren one of the house to sit, A joyful mother of sons; praise ye Jah!
114:001 ¶  In the going out of Israel from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a strange people,
114:002 Judah became His sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
114:003 The sea hath seen, and fleeth, The Jordan turneth backward.
114:004 The mountains have skipped as rams, Heights as sons of a flock.
114:005 What-to thee, O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, thou turnest back!
114:006 O mountains, ye skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock!
114:007 From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, From before the God of Jacob,
114:008 He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, The flint to a fountain of waters!
115:001 ¶  Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, But to Thy name give honour, For Thy kindness, for Thy truth.
115:002 Why do the nations say, ‘Where, pray, is their God.
115:003 And our God is in the heavens, All that He hath pleased He hath done.
115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, work of man’s hands,
115:005 A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,
115:006 Ears they have, and they hear not, A nose they have, and they smell not,
115:007 Their hands, but they handle not, Their feet, and they walk not;
115:008 Nor do they mutter through their throat, Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.
115:009 O Israel, trust in Jehovah, ‘Their help and their shield is He.’
115:010 O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah, ‘Their help and their shield is He.’
115:011 Ye fearing Jehovah, trust in Jehovah, ‘Their help and their shield is He.’
115:012 Jehovah hath remembered us, He blesseth, He blesseth the house of Israel, He blesseth the house of Aaron,
115:013 He blesseth those fearing Jehovah, The small with the great.
115:014 Jehovah addeth to you, to you, and to your sons.
115:015 Blessed are ye of Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,
115:016 The heavens-the heavens are Jehovah’s, And the earth He hath given to sons of men,
115:017 The dead praise not Jah, Nor any going down to silence.
115:018 And we, we bless Jah, From henceforth, and unto the age. Praise ye Jah!
116:001 ¶  I have loved, because Jehovah heareth My voice, my supplication,
116:002 Because He hath inclined His ear to me, And during my days I call.
116:003 Compassed me have cords of death, And straits of Sheol have found me, Distress and sorrow I find.
116:004 And in the name of Jehovah I call: I pray Thee, O Jehovah, deliver my soul,
116:005 Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous, Yea, our God is merciful,
116:006 A preserver of the simple is Jehovah, I was low, and to me He giveth salvation.
116:007 Turn back, O my soul, to thy rest, For Jehovah hath conferred benefits on thee.
116:008 For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing.
116:009 I walk habitually before Jehovah In the lands of the living.
116:010 I have believed, for I speak, I-I have been afflicted greatly.
116:011 I said in my haste, ‘Every man is a liar.’
116:012 What do I return to Jehovah? All His benefits are upon me.
116:013 The cup of salvation I lift up, And in the name of Jehovah I call.
116:014 My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people.
116:015 Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death for His saints.
116:016 Cause it to come, O Jehovah, for I am Thy servant. I am Thy servant, son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast opened my bonds.
116:017 To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks, And in the name of Jehovah I call.
116:018 My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people,
116:019 In the courts of the house of Jehovah, In thy midst, O Jerusalem, praise ye Jah!
117:001 ¶  Praise Jehovah, all ye nations, Glorify Him, all ye peoples.
117:002 For mighty to us hath been His kindness, And the truth of Jehovah is to the age. Praise ye Jah!
118:001 ¶  Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age is His kindness.
118:002 I pray you, let Israel say, That, to the age is His kindness.
118:003 I pray you, let the house of Aaron say, That, to the age is His kindness.
118:004 I pray you, let those fearing Jehovah say, That, to the age is His kindness.
118:005 From the straitness I called Jah, Jah answered me in a broad place.
118:006 Jehovah is for me, I do not fear what man doth to me.
118:007 Jehovah is for me among my helpers, And I-I look on those hating me.
118:008 Better to take refuge in Jehovah than to trust in man,
118:009 Better to take refuge in Jehovah, Than to trust in princes.
118:010 All nations have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.
118:011 They have compassed me about, Yea, they have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.
118:012 They compassed me about as bees, They have been extinguished as a fire of thorns, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.
118:013 Thou hast sorely thrust me to fall, And Jehovah hath helped me.
118:014 My strength and song is Jah, And He is to me for salvation.
118:015 A voice of singing and salvation, Is in the tents of the righteous, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly.
118:016 The right hand of Jehovah is exalted, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly.
118:017 I do not die, but live, And recount the works of Jah,
118:018 Jah hath sorely chastened me, And to death hath not given me up.
118:019 Open ye to me gates of righteousness, I enter into them-I thank Jah.
118:020 This is the gate to Jehovah, The righteous enter into it.
118:021 I thank Thee, for Thou hast answered me, And art to me for salvation.
118:022 A stone the builders refused Hath become head of a corner.
118:023 From Jehovah hath this been, It is wonderful in our eyes,
118:024 This is the day Jehovah hath made, We rejoice and are glad in it.
118:025 I beseech Thee, O Jehovah, save, I pray Thee, I beseech Thee, O Jehovah, prosper, I pray Thee.
118:026 Blessed is he who is coming In the name of Jehovah, We blessed you from the house of Jehovah,
118:027 God is Jehovah, and He giveth to us light, Direct ye the festal-sacrifice with cords, Unto the horns of the altar.
118:028 My God Thou art, and I confess Thee, My God, I exalt Thee.
118:029 Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age, is His kindness!
119:001 ¶  O the happiness of those perfect in the way, They are walking in the law of Jehovah,
119:002 O the happiness of those keeping His testimonies, With the whole heart they seek Him.
119:003 Yea, they have not done iniquity, In His ways they have walked.
119:004 Thou hast commanded us Thy precepts to keep diligently,
119:005 O that my ways were prepared to keep Thy statutes,
119:006 Then I am not ashamed In my looking unto all Thy commands.
119:007 I confess Thee with uprightness of heart, In my learning the judgments of Thy righteousness.
119:008 Thy statutes I keep, leave me not utterly! Beth
119:009 With what doth a young man purify his path? To observe-according to Thy word.
119:010 With all my heart I have sought Thee, Let me not err from Thy commands.
119:011 In my heart I have hid Thy saying, That I sin not before Thee.
119:012 Blessed art Thou, O Jehovah, teach me Thy statutes.
119:013 With my lips I have recounted All the judgments of Thy mouth.
119:014 In the way of Thy testimonies I have joyed, As over all wealth.

119:016 In Thy statutes I delight myself, I do not forget Thy word. Gimel
119:017 Confer benefits on Thy servant, I live, and I keep Thy word.
119:018 Uncover mine eyes, and I behold wonders out of Thy law.
119:019 A sojourner I am on earth, Hide not from me Thy commands.
119:020 Broken hath my soul for desire Unto Thy judgments at all times.
119:021 Thou hast rebuked the cursed proud, Who are erring from Thy commands.
119:022 Remove from me reproach and contempt, For Thy testimonies I have kept.
119:023 Princes also sat-against me they spoke, Thy servant doth meditate in Thy statutes,
119:024 Thy testimonies also are my delight, The men of my counsel! Daleth
119:025 Cleaved to the dust hath my soul, Quicken me according to Thy word.
119:026 My ways I have recounted, And Thou answerest me, teach me Thy statutes,
119:027 The way of Thy precepts cause me to understand, And I meditate in Thy wonders.
119:028 My soul hath dropped from affliction, Establish me according to Thy word.

119:031 I have adhered to Thy testimonies, O Jehovah, put me not to shame.
119:032 The way of Thy commands I run, For Thou dost enlarge my heart! He
119:033 Show me, O Jehovah, the way of Thy statutes, And I keep it-to the end.
119:034 Cause me to understand, and I keep Thy law, And observe it with the whole heart.
119:035 Cause me to tread in the path of Thy commands, For in it I have delighted.
119:036 Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies, And not unto dishonest gain.
119:037 Remove mine eyes from seeing vanity, In Thy way quicken Thou me.
119:038 Establish to Thy servant Thy saying, That is concerning Thy fear.

119:044 And I keep Thy law continually, To the age and for ever.
119:045 And I walk habitually in a broad place, For Thy precepts I have sought.
119:046 And I speak of Thy testimonies before kings, And I am not ashamed.

119:049 Remember the word to Thy servant, On which Thou hast caused me to hope.
119:050 This is my comfort in mine affliction, That Thy saying hath quickened me.
119:051 The proud have utterly scorned me, From Thy law I have not turned aside.
119:052 I remembered Thy judgments of old, O Jehovah, And I comfort myself.
119:053 Horror hath seized me, Because of the wicked forsaking Thy law.
119:054 Songs have been to me Thy statutes, In the house of my sojournings.
119:055 I have remembered in the night Thy name, O Jehovah, And I do keep Thy law.
119:056 This hath been to me, That Thy precepts I have kept! Cheth
119:057 My portion is Jehovah; I have said-to keep Thy words,

119:060 I have made haste, And delayed not, to keep Thy commands.
119:061 Cords of the wicked have surrounded me, Thy law I have not forgotten.
119:062 At midnight I rise to give thanks to Thee, For the judgments of Thy righteousness.

119:074 Those fearing Thee see me and rejoice, Because for Thy word I have hoped.
119:075 I have known, O Jehovah, That righteous are Thy judgments, And in faithfulness Thou hast afflicted me.
119:076 Let, I pray Thee, Thy kindness be to comfort me, According to Thy saying to Thy servant.

119:086 All Thy commands are faithfulness, With falsehood they have pursued me, Help Thou me.
119:087 Almost consumed me on earth have they, And I-I have not forsaken Thy precepts.
119:088 According to Thy kindness quicken Thou me, And I keep the testimony of Thy mouth! Lamed
119:089 To the age, O Jehovah, Thy word is set up in the heavens.

119:091 According to Thine ordinances They have stood this day, for the whole are Thy servants.
119:092 Unless Thy law were my delights, Then had I perished in mine affliction.
119:093 To the age I forget not Thy precepts, For by them Thou hast quickened me.
119:094 I am Thine, save Thou me, For Thy precepts I have sought.

119:169 My loud cry cometh near before Thee, O Jehovah; According to Thy word cause me to understand.
119:170 My supplication cometh in before Thee, According to Thy saying deliver Thou me.
119:171 My lips do utter praise, For Thou dost teach me Thy statutes.
119:172 My tongue doth sing of Thy saying, For all Thy commands are righteous.
119:173 Thy hand is for a help to me, For Thy commands I have chosen.
119:174 I have longed for Thy salvation, O Jehovah, And Thy law is my delight.
119:175 My soul liveth, and it doth praise Thee, And Thy judgments do help me.
119:176 I wandered as a lost sheep, seek Thy servant, For Thy precepts I have not forgotten!
120:001 ¶  Unto Jehovah in my distress I have called, And He answereth me.
120:002 O Jehovah, deliver my soul from a lying lip, From a deceitful tongue!
120:003 What doth He give to thee? And what doth He add to thee? O deceitful tongue!
120:004 Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with broom-coals.
120:005 Woe to me, for I have inhabited Mesech, I have dwelt with tents of Kedar.
120:006 Too much hath my soul dwelt with him who is hating peace.
120:007 I am peace, and when I speak they are for war!
121:001 ¶  I lift up mine eyes unto the hills, Whence doth my help come?
121:002 My help is from Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,
121:003 He suffereth not thy foot to be moved, Thy preserver slumbereth not.
121:004 Lo, He slumbereth not, nor sleepeth, He who is preserving Israel.
121:005 Jehovah is thy preserver, Jehovah is thy shade on thy right hand,
121:006 By day the sun doth not smite thee, Nor the moon by night.
121:007 Jehovah preserveth thee from all evil, He doth preserve thy soul.
121:008 Jehovah preserveth thy going out and thy coming in, From henceforth even unto the age!
122:001 ¶  I have rejoiced in those saying to me, ‘To the house of Jehovah we go.’
122:002 Our feet have been standing in thy gates, O Jerusalem!
122:003 Jerusalem-the builded one- Is as a city that is joined to itself together.
122:004 For thither have tribes gone up, Tribes of Jah, companies of Israel, To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.
122:005 For there have sat thrones of judgment, Thrones of the house of David.
122:006 Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem, At rest are those loving thee.
122:007 Peace is in thy bulwark, rest in thy high places,
122:008 For the sake of my brethren and my companions, Let me speak, I pray thee, ‘Peace be in thee.’
122:009 For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God, I seek good for thee!
123:001 ¶  Unto Thee I have lifted up mine eyes, O dweller in the heavens.
123:002 Lo, as eyes of men-servants Are unto the hand of their masters, As eyes of a maid-servant Are unto the hand of her mistress, So are our eyes unto Jehovah our God, Till that He doth favour us.
123:003 Favour us, O Jehovah, favour us, For greatly have we been filled with contempt,
123:004 Greatly hath our soul been filled With the scorning of the easy ones, With the contempt of the arrogant!
124:001 ¶  Save for Jehovah-who hath been for us, (Pray, let Israel say),
124:002 Save for Jehovah-who hath been for us, In the rising up of man against us,
124:003 Then alive they had swallowed us up, In the burning of their anger against us,
124:004 Then the waters had overflowed us, The stream passed over our soul,
124:005 Then passed over our soul had the proud waters.
124:006 Blessed is Jehovah who hath not given us, A prey to their teeth.
124:007 Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.
124:008 Our help is in the name of Jehovah, Maker of the heavens and earth!
125:001 ¶  Those trusting in Jehovah are as Mount Zion, It is not moved-to the age it abideth.
125:002 Jerusalem! mountains are round about her, And Jehovah is round about His people, From henceforth even unto the age.
125:003 For the rod of wickedness resteth not On the lot of the righteous, That the righteous put not forth on iniquity their hands.
125:004 Do good, O Jehovah, to the good, And to the upright in their hearts.
125:005 As to those turning to their crooked ways, Jehovah causeth them to go with workers of iniquity. Peace on Israel!
126:001 ¶  In Jehovah’s turning back to the captivity of Zion, We have been as dreamers.
126:002 Then filled with laughter is our mouth, And our tongue with singing, Then do they say among nations, ‘Jehovah did great things with these.’
126:003 Jehovah did great things with us, We have been joyful.
126:004 Turn again, O Jehovah, to our captivity, As streams in the south.
126:005 Those sowing in tears, with singing do reap,
126:006 Whoso goeth on and weepeth, Bearing the basket of seed, Surely cometh in with singing, bearing his sheaves!
127:001 ¶  If Jehovah doth not build the house, In vain have its builders laboured at it, If Jehovah doth not watch a city, In vain hath a watchman waked.
127:002 Vain for you who are rising early, Who delay sitting, eating the bread of griefs, So He giveth to His beloved one sleep.
127:003 Lo, an inheritance of Jehovah are sons, A reward is the fruit of the womb.
127:004 As arrows in the hand of a mighty one, So are the sons of the young men.
127:005 O the happiness of the man Who hath filled his quiver with them, They are not ashamed, For they speak with enemies in the gate!
128:001 ¶  O the happiness of every one fearing Jehovah, Who is walking in His ways.
128:002 The labour of thy hands thou surely eatest, Happy art thou, and good is to thee.
128:003 Thy wife is as a fruitful vine in the sides of thy house, Thy sons as olive plants around thy table.
128:004 Lo, surely thus is the man blessed who is fearing Jehovah.
128:005 Jehovah doth bless thee out of Zion, Look, then, on the good of Jerusalem, All the days of thy life,
128:006 And see the sons of thy sons! Peace on Israel!
129:001 ¶  Often they distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:
129:002 Often they distressed me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed over me.
129:003 Over my back have ploughers ploughed, They have made long their furrows.
129:004 Jehovah is righteous, He hath cut asunder cords of the wicked.
129:005 Confounded and turn backward do all hating Zion.
129:006 They are as grass of the roofs, That before it was drawn out withereth,
129:007 That hath not filled the hand of a reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.
129:008 And the passers by have not said, ‘The blessing of Jehovah is on you, We blessed you in the Name of Jehovah!’
130:001 ¶  From depths I have called Thee, Jehovah.
130:002 Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications.
130:003 If iniquities Thou dost observe, O Lord, who doth stand?
130:004 But with Thee is forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared.
130:005 I hoped for Jehovah-hoped hath my soul, And for His word I have waited.
130:006 My soul is for the Lord, More than those watching for morning, Watching for morning!
130:007 Israel doth wait on Jehovah, For with Jehovah is kindness, And abundant with Him is redemption.
130:008 And He doth redeem Israel from all his iniquities!
131:001 ¶  Jehovah, my heart hath not been haughty, Nor have mine eyes been high, Nor have I walked in great things, And in things too wonderful for me.
131:002 Have I not compared, and kept silent my soul, As a weaned one by its mother? As a weaned one by me is my soul.
131:003 Israel doth wait on Jehovah, From henceforth, and unto the age!
132:001 ¶  Remember, Jehovah, for David, all his afflictions.
132:002 Who hath sworn to Jehovah. He hath vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
132:003 ‘If I enter into the tent of my house, If I go up on the couch of my bed,
132:004 If I give sleep to mine eyes, To mine eyelids-slumber,
132:005 Till I do find a place for Jehovah, Tabernacles for the Mighty One of Jacob.
132:006 ‘Lo, we have heard it in Ephratah, We have found it in the fields of the forest.
132:007 We come in to His tabernacles, We bow ourselves at His footstool.
132:008 Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy rest, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength,
132:009 Thy priests do put on righteousness, And Thy pious ones cry aloud.
132:010 For the sake of David Thy servant, Turn not back the face of Thine anointed.
132:011 Jehovah hath sworn truth to David, He turneth not back from it: Of the fruit of thy body, I set on the throne for thee.
132:012 If thy sons keep My covenant, And My testimonies that I teach them, Their sons also for ever and ever, Do sit on the throne for thee.
132:013 For Jehovah hath fixed on Zion, He hath desired it for a seat to Himself,
132:014 This is My rest for ever and ever, Here do I sit, for I have desired it.
132:015 Her provision I greatly bless, Her needy ones I satisfy with bread,
132:016 And her priests I clothe with salvation, And her pious ones do sing aloud.
132:017 There I cause to spring up a horn for David, I have arranged a lamp for Mine anointed.
132:018 His enemies I do clothe with shame, And upon him doth his crown flourish!
133:001 ¶  Lo, how good and how pleasant The dwelling of brethren-even together!
133:002 As the good oil on the head, Coming down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, That cometh down on the skirt of his robes,
133:003 As dew of Hermon- That cometh down on hills of Zion, For there Jehovah commanded the blessing- Life unto the age!
134:001 ¶  Lo, bless Jehovah, all servants of Jehovah, Who are standing in the house of Jehovah by night.
134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, And bless ye Jehovah.
134:003 Jehovah doth bless thee out of Zion, The maker of the heavens and earth!
135:001 ¶  Praise ye Jah! Praise ye the name of Jehovah, Praise, ye servants of Jehovah,
135:002 Who are standing in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.
135:003 Praise ye Jah! for Jehovah is good, Sing praise to His name, for it is pleasant.
135:004 For Jacob hath Jah chosen for Himself, Israel for His peculiar treasure.
135:005 For I have known that great is Jehovah, Yea, our Lord is above all gods.
135:006 All that Jehovah pleased He hath done, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and all deep places,
135:007 Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth, Lightnings for the rain He hath made, Bringing forth wind from His treasures.
135:008 Who smote the first-born of Egypt, From man unto beast.
135:009 He sent tokens and wonders into thy midst, O Egypt, On Pharaoh and on all his servants.
135:010 Who smote many nations, and slew strong kings,
135:011 Even Sihon king of the Amorite, And Og king of Bashan, And all kingdoms of Canaan.
135:012 And He gave their land an inheritance, An inheritance to Israel His people,
135:013 O Jehovah, Thy name is to the age, O Jehovah, Thy memorial to all generations.
135:014 For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants comforteth Himself.
135:015 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, Work of the hands of man.
135:016 A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,
135:017 Ears they have, and they give not ear, Nose-there is no breath in their mouth!
135:018 Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.
135:019 O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah, O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah,
135:020 O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah, Those fearing Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.
135:021 Blessed is Jehovah from Zion, Inhabiting Jerusalem-praise ye Jah!
136:001 ¶  Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age is His kindness.
136:002 Give ye thanks to the God of gods, For to the age is His kindness.
136:003 Give ye thanks to the Lord of lords, For to the age is His kindness.
136:004 To Him doing great wonders by Himself alone, For to the age is His kindness.
136:005 To Him making the heavens by understanding, For to the age is His kindness.
136:006 To Him spreading the earth over the waters, For to the age is His kindness.
136:007 To Him making great lights, For to the age is His kindness.
136:008 The sun to rule by day, For to the age is His kindness.
136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night, For to the age is His kindness.
136:010 To Him smiting Egypt in their first-born, For to the age is His kindness.
136:011 And bringing forth Israel from their midst, For to the age is His kindness.
136:012 By a strong hand, and a stretched-out-arm, For to the age is His kindness.
136:013 To Him cutting the sea of Suph into parts, For to the age is His kindness,
136:014 And caused Israel to pass through its midst, For to the age is His kindness,
136:015 And shook out Pharaoh and his force in the sea of Suph, For to the age is His kindness.
136:016 To Him leading His people in a wilderness, For to the age is His kindness.
136:017 To Him smiting great kings, For to the age is His kindness.
136:018 Yea, He doth slay honourable kings, For to the age is His kindness.
136:019 Even Sihon king of the Amorite, For to the age is His kindness.
136:020 And Og king of Bashan, For to the age is His kindness.
136:021 And He gave their land for inheritance, For to the age is His kindness.
136:022 An inheritance to Israel His servant, For to the age is His kindness.
136:023 Who in our lowliness hath remembered us, For to the age is His kindness.
136:024 And He delivereth us from our adversaries, For to the age is His kindness.
136:025 Giving food to all flesh, For to the age is His kindness.
136:026 Give ye thanks to the God of the heavens, For to the age is His kindness!
137:001 ¶  By rivers of Babylon- There we did sit, Yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.
137:002 On willows in its midst we hung our harps.
137:003 For there our captors asked us the words of a song, And our spoilers-joy: ‘Sing ye to us of a song of Zion.’
137:004 How do we sing the song of Jehovah, On the land of a stranger?
137:005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, my right hand forgetteth!
137:006 My tongue doth cleave to my palate, If I do not remember thee, If I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy.
137:007 Remember, Jehovah, for the sons of Edom, The day of Jerusalem, Those saying, ‘Rase, rase to its foundation!’
137:008 O daughter of Babylon, O destroyed one, O the happiness of him who repayeth to thee thy deed, That thou hast done to us.
137:009 O the happiness of him who doth seize, And hath dashed thy sucklings on the rock!
138:001 ¶  I confess Thee, with all my heart, Before the gods I do praise Thee.
138:002 I bow myself toward Thy holy temple, And I confess Thy name, For Thy kindness, and for Thy truth, For Thou hast made great Thy saying above all Thy name.
138:003 In the day I called, when Thou dost answer me, Thou dost strengthen me in my soul with strength.
138:004 O Jehovah, all kings of earth confess Thee, When they have heard the sayings of Thy mouth.
138:005 And they sing in the ways of Jehovah, For great is the honour of Jehovah.
138:006 For high is Jehovah, and the lowly He seeth, And the haughty from afar He knoweth.
138:007 If I walk in the midst of distress Thou quickenest me, Against the anger of mine enemies Thou sendest forth Thy hand, And Thy right hand doth save me.
138:008 Jehovah doth perfect for me, O Jehovah, Thy kindness is to the age, The works of Thy hands let not fall!
139:001 ¶  Jehovah, Thou hast searched me, and knowest.
139:002 Thou-Thou hast known my sitting down, And my rising up, Thou hast attended to my thoughts from afar.
139:003 My path and my couch Thou hast fanned, And with all my ways hast been acquainted.
139:004 For there is not a word in my tongue, Lo, O Jehovah, Thou hast known it all!
139:005 Behind and before Thou hast besieged me, And Thou dost place on me Thy hand.
139:006 Knowledge too wonderful for me, It hath been set on high, I am not able for it.
139:007 Whither do I go from Thy Spirit? And whither from Thy face do I flee?
139:008 If I ascend the heavens-there Thou art, And spread out a couch in Sheol, lo, Thee!
139:009 I take the wings of morning, I dwell in the uttermost part of the sea,
139:010 Also there Thy hand doth lead me, And Thy right hand doth hold me.
139:011 And I say, ‘Surely darkness bruiseth me, Then night is light to me.
139:012 Also darkness hideth not from Thee, And night as day shineth, as is darkness so is light.
139:013 For Thou-Thou hast possessed my reins, Thou dost cover me in my mother’s belly.
139:014 I confess Thee, because that with wonders I have been distinguished. Wonderful are Thy works, And my soul is knowing it well.
139:015 My substance was not hid from Thee, When I was made in secret, Curiously wrought in the lower part of earth.
139:016 Mine unformed substance Thine eyes saw, And on Thy book all of them are written, The days they were formed- And not one among them.
139:017 And to me how precious have been Thy thoughts, O God, how great hath been their sum!
139:018 I recount them! than the sand they are more, I have waked, and I am still with Thee.
139:019 Dost Thou slay, O God, the wicked? Then, men of blood, turn aside from me!
139:020 Who exchange Thee for wickedness, Lifted up to vanity are Thine enemies.
139:021 Do not I hate, Jehovah, those hating Thee? And with Thy withstanders grieve myself?
139:022 With perfect hatred I have hated them, Enemies they have become to me.
139:023 Search me, O God, and know my heart, Try me, and know my thoughts,
139:024 And see if a grievous way be in me, And lead me in a way age-during!
140:001 ¶  Deliver me, O Jehovah, from an evil man, From one of violence Thou keepest me.
140:002 Who have devised evils in the heart, All the day they assemble for wars.
140:003 They sharpened their tongue as a serpent, Poison of an adder is under their lips. Selah.
140:004 Preserve me, Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked, From one of violence Thou keepest me, Who have devised to overthrow my steps.
140:005 The proud hid a snare for me-and cords, They spread a net by the side of the path, Snares they have set for me. Selah.
140:006 I have said to Jehovah, ‘My God art Thou, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of my supplications.’
140:007 O Jehovah, my Lord, strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of armour.
140:008 Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked, His wicked device bring not forth, They are high. Selah.
140:009 The chief of my surrounders, The perverseness of their lips covereth them.
140:010 They cause to fall on themselves burning coals, Into fire He doth cast them, Into deep pits-they arise not.
140:011 A talkative man is not established in the earth, One of violence-evil hunteth to overflowing.
140:012 I have known that Jehovah doth execute The judgment of the afflicted, The judgment of the needy.
140:013 Only-the righteous give thanks to Thy name, The upright do dwell with Thy presence!
141:001 ¶  O Jehovah, I have called Thee, haste to me, Give ear to my voice when I call to Thee.
141:002 My prayer is prepared-incense before Thee, The lifting up of my hands-the evening present.
141:003 Set, O Jehovah, a watch for my mouth, Watch Thou over the door of my lips.
141:004 Incline not my heart to an evil thing, To do habitually actions in wickedness, With men working iniquity, Yea, I eat not of their pleasant things.
141:005 The righteous doth beat me in kindness. And doth reprove me, Oil of the head my head disalloweth not, For still my prayer is about their vexations.
141:006 Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock, And they have heard my sayings, For they have been pleasant.
141:007 As one tilling and ripping up in the land, Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul.
141:008 But to Thee, O Jehovah, my Lord, are mine eyes, In Thee I have trusted, Make not bare my soul.
141:009 Keep me from the gin they laid for me, Even snares of workers of iniquity.
141:010 The wicked fall in their nets together, till I pass over!
142:001 ¶  My voice is unto Jehovah, I cry, My voice is unto Jehovah, I entreat grace.
142:002 I pour forth before Him my meditation, My distress before Him I declare.
142:003 When my spirit hath been feeble in me, Then Thou hast known my path; In the way in which I walk, They have hid a snare for me.
142:004 Looking on the right hand-and seeing, And I have none recognizing; Perished hath refuge from me, There is none inquiring for my soul.
142:005 I have cried unto thee, O Jehovah, I have said, ‘Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.’
142:006 Attend Thou unto my loud cry, For I have become very low, Deliver Thou me from my pursuers, For they have been stronger than I.
142:007 Bring forth from prison my soul to confess Thy name, The righteous do compass me about, When Thou conferrest benefits upon me!
143:001 ¶  O Jehovah, hear my prayer, Give ear unto my supplications, In Thy faithfulness answer me-in Thy righteousness.
143:002 And enter not into judgment with Thy servant, For no one living is justified before Thee.
143:003 For an enemy hath pursued my soul, He hath bruised to the earth my life, He hath caused me to dwell in dark places, As the dead of old.
143:004 And my spirit in me is become feeble, Within me is my heart become desolate.
143:005 I have remembered days of old, I have meditated on all Thine acts, On the work of Thy hand I muse.
143:006 I have spread forth my hands unto Thee, My soul is as a weary land for Thee. Selah.
143:007 Haste, answer me, O Jehovah, My spirit hath been consumed, Hide not Thou Thy face from me, Or I have been compared with those going down to the pit.
143:008 Cause me to hear in the morning Thy kindness, For in Thee I have trusted, Cause me to know the way that I go, For unto Thee I have lifted up my soul.
143:009 Deliver me from mine enemies, O Jehovah, Near Thee I am covered.
143:010 Teach me to do Thy good pleasure, For Thou art my God-Thy Spirit is good, Lead me into a land of uprightness.
143:011 For Thy name’s sake O Jehovah, Thou dost quicken me, In Thy righteousness, Thou bringest out from distress my soul,
143:012 And in Thy kindness cuttest off mine enemies, And hast destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, For I am Thy servant!
144:001 ¶  Blessed is Jehovah my rock, who is teaching My hands for war, my fingers for battle.
144:002 My kind one, and my bulwark, My tower, and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I have trusted, Who is subduing my people under me!
144:003 Jehovah, what is man that Thou knowest him? Son of man, that Thou esteemest him?
144:004 Man to vanity hath been like, His days are as a shadow passing by.
144:005 Jehovah, incline Thy heavens and come down, ‘Strike against mountains, and they smoke.
144:006 Send forth lightning, and scatter them, Send forth Thine arrows, and trouble them,
144:007 Send forth Thy hand from on high, Free me, and deliver me from many waters, From the hand of sons of a stranger,
144:008 Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
144:009 O God, a new song I sing to Thee, On a psaltery of ten strings I sing praise to Thee.
144:010 Who is giving deliverance to kings, Who is freeing David His servant from the sword of evil.
144:011 Free me, and deliver me From the hand of sons of a stranger, Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood,
144:012 Because our sons are as plants, Becoming great in their youth, Our daughters as hewn stones, Polished-the likeness of a palace,
144:013 Our garners are full, bringing out from kind to kind, Our flocks are bringing forth thousands, Ten thousands in our out-places,
144:014 Our oxen are carrying, there is no breach, And there is no outgoing, And there is no crying in our broad places.
144:015 O the happiness of the people that is thus, O the happiness of the people whose God is Jehovah!
145:001 ¶  I exalt Thee, my God, O king, And bless Thy name to the age and for ever.
145:002 Every day do I bless Thee, And praise Thy name to the age and for ever.
145:003 Great is Jehovah, and praised greatly, And of His greatness there is no searching.
145:004 Generation to generation praiseth Thy works, And Thy mighty acts they declare.
145:005 The honour-the glory of Thy majesty, And the matters of Thy wonders I declare.
145:006 And the strength of Thy fearful acts they tell, And Thy greatness I recount.
145:007 The memorial of the abundance of Thy goodness they send forth. And Thy righteousness they sing.
145:008 Gracious and merciful is Jehovah, Slow to anger, and great in kindness.
145:009 Good is Jehovah to all, And His mercies are over all His works.
145:010 Confess Thee O Jehovah, do all Thy works, And Thy saints do bless Thee.
145:011 The honour of Thy kingdom they tell, And of Thy might they speak,
145:012 To make known to sons of men His mighty acts, The honour of the majesty of His kingdom.
145:013 Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, And Thy dominion is in all generations.
145:014 Jehovah is supporting all who are falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.
145:015 The eyes of all unto Thee do look, And Thou art giving to them their food in its season,
145:016 Opening Thy hand, and satisfying The desire of every living thing.
145:017 Righteous is Jehovah in all His ways, And kind in all His works.
145:018 Near is Jehovah to all those calling Him, To all who call Him in truth.

145:020 Jehovah preserveth all those loving Him, And all the wicked He destroyeth.
145:021 The praise of Jehovah my mouth speaketh, And all flesh doth bless His holy name, To the age and for ever!

147:004 Appointing the number of the stars, To all them He giveth names.
147:005 Great is our Lord, and abundant in power, Of His understanding there is no narration.
147:006 Jehovah is causing the meek to stand, Making low the wicked unto the earth.
147:007 Answer ye to Jehovah with thanksgiving, Sing ye to our God with a harp.
147:008 Who is covering the heavens with clouds, Who is preparing for the earth rain, Who is causing grass to spring up on mountains,
147:009 Giving to the beast its food, To the young of the ravens that call.
147:010 Not in the might of the horse doth He delight, Not in the legs of a man is He pleased.
147:011 Jehovah is pleased with those fearing Him, With those waiting for His kindness.

147:015 Who is sending forth His saying on earth, Very speedily doth His word run.
147:016 Who is giving snow like wool, Hoar-frost as ashes He scattereth.
147:017 Casting forth His ice like morsels, Before His cold who doth stand?
147:018 He sendeth forth His word and melteth them, He causeth His wind to blow-the waters flow.
147:019 Declaring His words to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.
147:020 He hath not done so to any nation, As to judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye Jah!

148:006 And He establisheth them for ever to the age, A statute He gave, and they pass not over.
148:007 Praise ye Jehovah from the earth, Dragons and all deeps,
148:008 Fire and hail, snow and vapour, Whirlwind doing His word;
148:009 The mountains and all heights, Fruit tree, and all cedars,
148:010 The wild beast, and all cattle, Creeping thing, and winged bird,
148:011 Kings of earth, and all peoples, Chiefs, and all judges of earth,

149:005 Exult do saints in honour, They sing aloud on their beds.
149:006 The exaltation of God is in their throat, And a two-edged sword in their hand.
149:007 To do vengeance among nations, Punishments among the peoples.
149:008 To bind their kings with chains, And their honoured ones with fetters of iron,
149:009 To do among them the judgment written, An honour it is for all his saints. Praise ye Jah!

150:006 All that doth breathe doth praise Jah! Praise ye Jah!
