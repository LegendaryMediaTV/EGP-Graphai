001:001 ¶  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timotheus the brother,
001:002 to the saints in Colossae, and to the faithful brethren in Christ: Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!
001:003 We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you,
001:004 having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love that is to all the saints,
001:005 because of the hope that is laid up for you in the heavens, which ye heard of before in the word of the truth of the good news,
001:006 which is present to you, as also in all the world, and is bearing fruit, as also in you, from the day in which ye heard, and knew the grace of God in truth;
001:007 as ye also learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful ministrant of the Christ,
001:008 who also did declare to us your love in the Spirit.
001:009 Because of this, we also, from the day in which we heard, do not cease praying for you, and asking that ye may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
001:010 to your walking worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, in every good work being fruitful, and increasing to the knowledge of God,
001:011 in all might being made mighty according to the power of His glory, to all endurance and long-suffering with joy.
001:012 Giving thanks to the Father who did make us meet for the participation of the inheritance of the saints in the light,
001:013 who did rescue us out of the authority of the darkness, and did translate us into the reign of the Son of His love,
001:014 in whom we have the redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of the sins,
001:015 who is the image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation,
001:016 because in him were the all things created, those in the heavens, and those upon the earth, those visible, and those invisible, whether thrones, whether lordships, whether principalities, whether authorities; all things through him, and for him, have been created,
001:017 and himself is before all, and the all things in him have consisted.
001:018 And himself is the head of the body-the assembly-who is a beginning, a first-born out of the dead, that he might become in all things-himself-first,
001:019 because in him it did please all the fulness to tabernacle,
001:020 and through him to reconcile the all things to himself-having made peace through the blood of his cross-through him, whether the things upon the earth, whether the things in the heavens.
001:021 And you-once being alienated, and enemies in the mind, in the evil works, yet now did he reconcile,
001:022 in the body of his flesh through the death, to present you holy, and unblemished, and unblameable before himself,
001:023 if also ye remain in the faith, being founded and settled, and not moved away from the hope of the good news, which ye heard, which was preached in all the creation that is under the heaven, of which I became-I Paul-a ministrant.
001:024 I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and do fill up the things lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the assembly,
001:025 of which I-I did become a ministrant according to the dispensation of God, that was given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God,
001:026 the secret that hath been hid from the ages and from the generations, but now was manifested to his saints,
001:027 to whom God did will to make known what is the riches of the glory of this secret among the nations-which is Christ in you, the hope of the glory,
001:028 whom we proclaim, warning every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,
001:029 for which also I labour, striving according to his working that is working in me in power.
002:001 ¶  For I wish you to know how great a conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,
002:002 that their hearts may be comforted, being united in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding, to the full knowledge of the secret of the God and Father, and of the Christ,
002:003 in whom are all the treasures of the wisdom and the knowledge hid,
002:004 and this I say, that no one may beguile you in enticing words,
002:005 for if even in the flesh I am absent-yet in the spirit I am with you, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in regard to Christ;
002:006 as, then, ye did receive Christ Jesus the Lord, in him walk ye,
002:007 being rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the faith, as ye were taught-abounding in it in thanksgiving.
002:008 See that no one shall be carrying you away as spoil through the philosophy and vain deceit, according to the deliverance of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ,
002:009 because in him doth tabernacle all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,
002:010 and ye are in him made full, who is the head of all principality and authority,
002:011 in whom also ye were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of the Christ,
002:012 being buried with him in the baptism, in which also ye rose with him through the faith of the working of God, who did raise him out of the dead.
002:013 And you-being dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh-He made alive together with him, having forgiven you all the trespasses,
002:014 having blotted out the handwriting in the ordinances that is against us, that was contrary to us, and he hath taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross;
002:015 having stripped the principalities and the authorities, he made a shew of them openly-having triumphed over them in it.
002:016 Let no one, then, judge you in eating or in drinking, or in respect of a feast, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths,
002:017 which are a shadow of the coming things, and the body is of the Christ;
002:018 let no one beguile you of your prize, delighting in humble-mindedness and in worship of the messengers, intruding into the things he hath not seen, being vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh,
002:019 and not holding the head, from which all the body-through the joints and bands gathering supply, and being knit together-may increase with the increase of God.
002:020 If, then, ye did die with the Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances?
002:021 -thou mayest not touch, nor taste, nor handle-
002:022 which are all for destruction with the using, after the commands and teachings of men,
002:023 which are, indeed, having a matter of wisdom in will-worship, and humble-mindedness, and neglecting of body-not in any honour, unto a satisfying of the flesh.
003:001 ¶  If, then, ye were raised with the Christ, the things above seek ye, where the Christ is, on the right hand of God seated,
003:002 the things above mind ye, not the things upon the earth,
003:003 for ye did die, and your life hath been hid with the Christ in God;
003:004 when the Christ-our life-may be manifested, then also we with him shall be manifested in glory.
003:005 Put to death, then, your members that are upon the earth-whoredom, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and the covetousness, which is idolatry-
003:006 because of which things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,
003:007 in which also ye-ye did walk once, when ye lived in them;
003:008 but now put off, even ye, the whole-anger, wrath, malice, evil-speaking, filthy talking-out of your mouth.
003:009 Lie not one to another, having put off the old man with his practices,
003:010 and having put on the new, which is renewed in regard to knowledge, after the image of Him who did create him;
003:011 where there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, freeman-but the all and in all-Christ.
003:012 Put on, therefore, as choice ones of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humble-mindedness, meekness, long-suffering,
003:013 forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any one with any one may have a quarrel, as also the Christ did forgive you-so also ye;
003:014 and above all these things, have love, which is a bond of the perfection,
003:015 and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also ye were called in one body, and become thankful.
003:016 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing each other, in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, in grace singing in your hearts to the Lord;
003:017 and all, whatever ye may do in word or in work, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus-giving thanks to the God and Father, through him.
003:018 The wives! be subject to your own husbands, as is fit in the Lord;
003:019 the husbands! love your wives, and be not bitter with them;
003:020 the children! obey the parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord;
003:021 the fathers! vex not your children, lest they be discouraged.
003:022 The servants! obey in all things those who are masters according to the flesh, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God;
003:023 and all, whatever ye may do-out of soul work-as to the Lord, and not to men,
003:024 having known that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance-for the Lord Christ ye serve;
003:025 and he who is doing unrighteously shall receive what he did unrighteously, and there is no acceptance of persons.
004:001 ¶  The masters! that which is righteous and equal to the servants give ye, having known that ye also have a Master in the heavens.
004:002 In the prayer continue ye, watching in it in thanksgiving;
004:003 praying at the same time also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of the Christ, because of which also I have been bound,
004:004 that I may manifest it, as it behoveth me to speak;
004:005 in wisdom walk ye toward those without, the time forestalling;
004:006 your word always in grace-with salt being seasoned-to know how it behoveth you to answer each one.
004:007 All the things concerning me make known to you shall Tychicus-the beloved brother, and faithful ministrant, and fellow-servant in the Lord-
004:008 whom I did send unto you for this very thing, that he might know the things concerning you, and might comfort your hearts,
004:009 with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother, who is of you; all things to you shall they make known that are here.
004:010 Salute you doth Aristarchus, my fellow-captive, and Marcus, the nephew of Barnabas, (concerning whom ye did receive commands-if he may come unto you receive him,)
004:011 and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only are fellow-workers for the reign of God who did become a comfort to me.
004:012 Salute you doth Epaphras, who is of you, a servant of Christ, always striving for you in the prayers, that ye may stand perfect and made full in all the will of God,
004:013 for I do testify to him, that he hath much zeal for you, and those in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.
004:014 Salute you doth Lukas, the beloved physician, and Demas;
004:015 salute ye those in Laodicea-brethren, and Nymphas, and the assembly in his house;
004:016 and when the epistle may be read with you, cause that also in the assembly of the Laodiceans it may be read, and the epistle from Laodicea that ye also may read;
004:017 and say to Archippus, ‘See to the ministration that thou didst receive in the Lord, that thou mayest fulfil it.’
004:018 The salutation by the hand of me, Paul; remember my bonds; the grace is with you. Amen.
