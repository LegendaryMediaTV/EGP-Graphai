001:001 ¶  Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
001:002 in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;
001:003 but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
001:004 to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;
001:006 if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.
001:007 For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
001:008 but given to hospitality, as lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;
001:009 holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.
001:010 For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,
001:011 whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
001:012 One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.
001:013 This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
001:014 not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
001:015 To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
001:016 They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
002:001 ¶  But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:
002:002 that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:
002:003 that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
002:004 that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
002:005 to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:
002:006 the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:
002:007 in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity,
002:008 sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.
002:009 Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them in all things; not gainsaying;
002:010 not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
002:011 For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
002:012 instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;
002:013 looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
002:014 who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
002:015 These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
003:001 ¶  Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
003:002 to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
003:003 For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
003:004 But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,
003:005 not by works done in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
003:006 which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
003:007 that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
003:008 Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
003:009 but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
003:010 A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;
003:011 knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
003:013 Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
003:014 And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
003:015 All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
