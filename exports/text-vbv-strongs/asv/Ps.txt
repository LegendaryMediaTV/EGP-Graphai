001:001 ¶  Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:
001:002 But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night.
001:003 And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
001:004 The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
001:005 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
001:006 For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.
002:001 ¶  Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?
002:002 The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying,
002:003 Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us.
002:004 He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.
002:005 Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure:
002:006 Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion.
002:007 I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee.
002:008 Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
002:009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
002:010 Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
002:011 Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
002:012 Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.
003:001 ¶  Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me.
003:002 Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. [Selah
003:003 But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head.
003:004 I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill.[Selah
003:005 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; For Jehovah sustaineth me.
003:006 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.
003:007 Arise, O Jehovah; Save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
003:008 Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people.[Selah
004:001 ¶  Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; Thou hast set me at large when I was in distress: Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
004:002 O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? How long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood?[Selah
004:003 But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.
004:004 Stand in awe, and sin not: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. [Selah
004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in Jehovah.
004:006 Many there are that say, Who will show us any good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
004:007 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than they have when their grain and their new wine are increased.
004:008 In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety.
005:001 ¶  Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.
005:002 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For unto thee do I pray.
005:003 O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch.
005:004 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee.
005:005 The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
005:006 Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
005:007 But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
005:008 Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face.
005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.
005:010 Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee.
005:011 But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
005:012 For thou wilt bless the righteous; O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.
006:001 ¶  O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
006:002 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled.
006:003 My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O Jehovah, how long?
006:004 Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindness’ sake.
006:005 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?
006:006 I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
006:007 Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.
006:008 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping.
006:009 Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.
006:010 All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled: They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly.
007:001 ¶  O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge: Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me,
007:002 Lest they tear my soul like a lion, Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
007:003 O Jehovah my God, if I have done this; If there be iniquity in my hands;
007:004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary;)
007:005 Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in the dust.[Selah
007:006 Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger; Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries, And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment.
007:007 And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about; And over them return thou on high.
007:008 Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples: Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me.
007:009 O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous: For the righteous God trieth the minds and hearts.
007:010 My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart.
007:011 God is a righteous judge, Yea, a God that hath indignation every day.
007:012 If a man turn not, he will whet his sword; He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
007:013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; He maketh his arrows fiery shafts.
007:014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
007:015 He hath made a pit, and digged it, And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
007:016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.
007:017 I will give thanks unto Jehovah according to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.
008:001 ¶  O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens!
008:002 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
008:003 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
008:004 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?
008:005 For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor.
008:006 Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:
008:007 All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field,
008:008 The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
008:009 O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
009:001 ¶  I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.
009:002 I will be glad and exult in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.
009:003 When mine enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at thy presence.
009:004 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously.
009:005 Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
009:006 The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished.
009:007 But Jehovah sitteth as king for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment;
009:008 And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
009:009 Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble;
009:010 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
009:011 Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion: Declare among the people his doings.
009:012 For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.
009:013 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my affliction which I suffer of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;
009:014 That I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.
009:015 The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
009:016 Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.[Higgaion. Selah
009:017 The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God.
009:018 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.
009:019 Arise, O Jehovah; Let not man prevail: Let the nations be judged in thy sight.
009:020 Put them in fear, O Jehovah: Let the nations know themselves to be but men.[Selah
010:001 ¶  Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
010:002 In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.
010:003 For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, And the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth Jehovah.
010:004 The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it. All his thoughts are, There is no God.
010:005 His ways are firm at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.
010:006 He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; To all generations I shall not be in adversity.
010:007 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
010:008 He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are privily set against the helpless.
010:009 He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.
010:010 He croucheth, he boweth down, And the helpless fall by his strong ones.
010:011 He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten; He hideth his face; he will never see it.
010:012 Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy hand: Forget not the poor.
010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it?
010:014 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: The helpless committeth himself unto thee; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.
010:015 Break thou the arm of the wicked; And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
010:016 Jehovah is King for ever and ever: The nations are perished out of his land.
010:017 Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;
010:018 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.
011:001 ¶  In Jehovah do I take refuge: How say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain;
011:002 For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string, That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart;
011:003 If the foundations be destroyed, What can the righteous do?
011:004 Jehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah, his throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
011:005 Jehovah trieth the righteous; But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
011:006 Upon the wicked he will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.
011:007 For Jehovah is righteous; He loveth righteousness: The upright shall behold his face.
012:001 ¶  Help, Jehovah; For the godly man ceaseth; For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
012:002 They speak falsehood every one with his neighbor: With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.
012:003 Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaketh great things;
012:004 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; Our lips are our own: Who is lord over us?
012:005 Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; I will set him in the safety he panteth for.
012:006 The words of Jehovah are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, Purified seven times.
012:007 Thou wilt keep them, O Jehovah, Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever.
012:008 The wicked walk on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
013:001 ¶  How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
013:003 Consider and answer me, O Jehovah my God: Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
013:004 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; Lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
013:005 But I have trusted in thy lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
013:006 I will sing unto Jehovah, Because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
014:001 ¶  The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good.
014:002 Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.
014:003 They are all gone aside; They are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah?
014:005 There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous.
014:006 Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge.
014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
015:001 ¶  Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
015:002 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart;
015:003 He that slandereth not with his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor;
015:004 In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;
015:005 He that putteth not out his money to interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
016:001 ¶  Preserve me, O God; For in thee do I take refuge.
016:002 O my soul, thou hast said unto Jehovah, Thou art my Lord: I have no good beyond thee.
016:003 As for the saints that are in the earth, They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.
016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that give gifts for another god: Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, Nor take their names upon my lips.
016:005 Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: Thou maintainest my lot.
016:006 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly heritage.
016:007 I will bless Jehovah, who hath given me counsel; Yea, my heart instructeth me in the night seasons.
016:008 I have set Jehovah always before me: Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; My flesh also shall dwell in safety.
016:010 For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol; Neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.
016:011 Thou wilt show me the path of life: In thy presence is fulness of joy; In thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
017:001 ¶  Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto my cry; Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
017:002 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; Let thine eyes look upon equity.
017:003 Thou hast proved my heart; Thou hast visited me in the night; Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
017:004 As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent.
017:005 My steps have held fast to thy paths, My feet have not slipped.
017:006 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
017:007 Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge in thee From those that rise up against them.
017:008 Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
017:009 From the wicked that oppress me, My deadly enemies, that compass me about.
017:010 They are inclosed in their own fat: With their mouth they speak proudly.
017:011 They have now compassed us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
017:012 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
017:013 Arise, O Jehovah, Confront him, cast him down: Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword;
017:014 From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: They are satisfied with children, And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
017:015 As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with beholding thy form.
018:001 ¶  I love thee, O Jehovah, my strength.
018:002 Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
018:003 I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
018:004 The cords of death compassed me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
018:005 The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.
018:006 In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears.
018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.
018:008 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.
018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.
018:010 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he soared upon the wings of the wind.
018:011 He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
018:012 At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.
018:013 Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.
018:014 And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.
018:015 Then the channels of waters appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
018:016 He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters.
018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from them that hated me; For they were too mighty for me.
018:018 They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.
018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
018:020 Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
018:021 For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.
018:022 For all his ordinances were before me, And I put not away his statutes from me.
018:023 I was also perfect with him, And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
018:024 Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
018:025 With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;
018:026 With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.
018:027 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; But the haughty eyes thou wilt bring down.
018:028 For thou wilt light my lamp: Jehovah my God will lighten my darkness.
018:029 For by thee I run upon a troop; And by my God do I leap over a wall.
018:030 As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.
018:031 For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, besides our God,
018:032 The God that girdeth me with strength, And maketh my way perfect?
018:033 He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: And setteth me upon my high places.
018:034 He teacheth my hands to war; So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
018:035 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy right hand hath holden me up, And thy gentleness hath made me great.
018:036 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.
018:037 I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; Neither will I turn again till they are consumed.
018:038 I will smite them through, so that they shall not be able to rise: They shall fall under my feet.
018:039 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
018:040 Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.
018:041 They cried, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.
018:042 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.
018:043 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
018:044 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me.
018:045 The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.
018:046 Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,
018:047 Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And subdueth peoples under me.
018:048 He rescueth me from mine enemies; Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.
018:049 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.
018:050 Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.
019:001 ¶  The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament showeth his handiwork.
019:002 Day unto day uttereth speech, And night unto night showeth knowledge.
019:003 There is no speech nor language; Their voice is not heard.
019:004 Their line is gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
019:005 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.
019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heavens, And his circuit unto the ends of it; And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
019:007 The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul: The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple.
019:008 The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes.
019:009 The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever: The ordinances of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether.
019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb.
019:011 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: In keeping them there is great reward.
019:012 Who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults.
019:013 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me: Then shall I be upright, And I shall be clear from great transgression.
019:014 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer.
020:001 ¶  Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high;
020:002 Send thee help from the sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion;
020:003 Remember all thy offerings, And accept thy burnt-sacrifice; [Selah
020:004 Grant thee thy heart’s desire, And fulfil all thy counsel.
020:005 We will triumph in thy salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: Jehovah fulfil all thy petitions.
020:006 Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving strength of his right hand.
020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God.
020:008 They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen, and stand upright.
020:009 Save, Jehovah: Let the King answer us when we call.
021:001 ¶  The king shall joy in thy strength, O Jehovah; And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
021:002 Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, And hast not withholden the request of his lips. [Selah
021:003 For thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness: Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.
021:004 He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him, Even length of days for ever and ever.
021:005 His glory is great in thy salvation: Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him.
021:006 For thou makest him most blessed for ever: Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence.
021:007 For the king trusteth in Jehovah; And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.
021:008 Thy hand will find out all thine enemies; Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee.
021:009 Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger: Jehovah will swallow them up in his wrath, And the fire shall devour them.
021:010 Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, And their seed from among the children of men.
021:011 For they intended evil against thee; They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.
021:012 For thou wilt make them turn their back; Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face.
021:013 Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: So will we sing and praise thy power.
022:001 ¶  My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?
022:002 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou answerest not; And in the night season, and am not silent.
022:003 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
022:004 Our fathers trusted in thee: They trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
022:005 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: They trusted in thee, and were not put to shame.
022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised of the people.
022:007 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
022:008 Commit thyself unto Jehovah; Let him deliver him: Let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him.
022:009 But thou art he that took me out of the womb; Thou didst make me trust when I was upon my mother’s breasts.
022:010 I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God since my mother bare me.
022:011 Be not far from me; For trouble is near; For there is none to help.
022:012 Many bulls have compassed me; Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
022:013 They gape upon me with their mouth, As a ravening and a roaring lion.
022:014 I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint: My heart is like wax; It is melted within me.
022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; And thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
022:016 For dogs have compassed me: A company of evil-doers have inclosed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.
022:017 I may count all my bones; They look and stare upon me.
022:018 They part my garments among them, And upon my vesture do they cast lots.
022:019 But be not thou far off, O Jehovah: O thou my succor, haste thee to help me.
022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword, My darling from the power of the dog.
022:021 Save me from the lion’s mouth; Yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me.
022:022 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee.
022:023 Ye that fear Jehovah, praise him; All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.
022:024 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Neither hath he hid his face from him; But when he cried unto him, he heard.
022:025 Of thee cometh my praise in the great assembly: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
022:026 The meek shall eat and be satisfied; They shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: Let your heart live for ever.
022:027 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
022:028 For the kingdom is Jehovah’s; And he is the ruler over the nations.
022:029 All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship: All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, Even he that cannot keep his soul alive.
022:030 A seed shall serve him; It shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation.
022:031 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness Unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it.
023:001 ¶  Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want.
023:002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters.
023:003 He restoreth my soul: He guideth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.
023:004 Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
023:005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou hast anointed my head with oil; My cup runneth over.
023:006 Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life; And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever.
024:001 ¶  The earth is Jehovah’s, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein.
024:002 For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods.
024:003 Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place?
024:004 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not sworn deceitfully.
024:005 He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
024:006 This is the generation of them that seek after him, That seek thy face, even Jacob.[Selah
024:007 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.
024:008 Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle.
024:009 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.
024:010 Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, He is the King of glory. [Selah
025:001 ¶  Unto thee, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.
025:002 O my God, in thee have I trusted, Let me not be put to shame; Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
025:003 Yea, none that wait for thee shall be put to shame: They shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without cause.
025:004 Show me thy ways, O Jehovah; Teach me thy paths.
025:005 Guide me in thy truth, and teach me; For thou art the God of my salvation; For thee do I wait all the day.
025:006 Remember, O Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindness; For they have been ever of old.
025:007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me, For thy goodness’ sake, O Jehovah.
025:008 Good and upright is Jehovah: Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way.
025:009 The meek will he guide in justice; And the meek will he teach his way.
025:010 All the paths of Jehovah are lovingkindness and truth Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
025:011 For thy name’s sake, O Jehovah, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.
025:012 What man is he that feareth Jehovah? Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose.
025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease; And his seed shall inherit the land.
025:014 The friendship of Jehovah is with them that fear him; And he will show them his covenant.
025:015 Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; For he will pluck my feet out of the net.
025:016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; For I am desolate and afflicted.
025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: Oh bring thou me out of my distresses.
025:018 Consider mine affliction and my travail; And forgive all my sins.
025:019 Consider mine enemies, for they are many; And they hate me with cruel hatred.
025:020 Oh keep my soul, and deliver me: Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.
025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for thee.
025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, Out all of his troubles.
026:001 ¶  Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering.
026:002 Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; Try my heart and my mind.
026:003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes; And I have walked in thy truth.
026:004 I have not sat with men of falsehood; Neither will I go in with dissemblers.
026:005 I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And will not sit with the wicked.
026:006 I will wash my hands in innocency: So will I compass thine altar, O Jehovah;
026:007 That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, And tell of all thy wondrous works.
026:008 Jehovah, I love the habitation of thy house, And the place where thy glory dwelleth.
026:009 Gather not my soul with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood;
026:010 In whose hands is wickedness, And their right hand is full of bribes.
026:011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: Redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
026:012 My foot standeth in an even place: In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.
027:001 ¶  Jehovah is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?
027:002 When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
027:003 Though a host should encamp against me, My heart shall not fear: Though war should rise against me, Even then will I be confident.
027:004 One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after; That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, And to inquire in his temple.
027:005 For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me; He will lift me up upon a rock.
027:006 And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah.
027:007 Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice: Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
027:008 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; My heart said unto thee, Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek.
027:009 Hide not thy face from me; Put not thy servant away in anger: Thou hast been my help; Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, Then Jehovah will take me up.
027:011 Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; And lead me in a plain path, Because of mine enemies.
027:012 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries: For false witnesses are risen up against me, And such as breathe out cruelty.
027:013 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living.
027:014 Wait for Jehovah: Be strong, And let thy heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.
028:001 ¶  Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I call: My rock, be not thou deaf unto me; Lest, if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
028:003 Draw me not away with the wicked, And with the workers of iniquity; That speak peace with their neighbors, But mischief is in their hearts.
028:004 Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings: Give them after the operation of their hands; Render to them their desert.
028:005 Because they regard not the works of Jehovah, Nor the operation of his hands, He will break them down and not build them up.
028:006 Blessed be Jehovah, Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
028:007 Jehovah is my strength and my shield; My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped: Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; And with my song will I praise him.
028:008 Jehovah is their strength, And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.
028:009 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.
029:001 ¶  Ascribe unto Jehovah, O ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.
029:002 Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name; Worship Jehovah in holy array.
029:003 The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters: The God of glory thundereth, Even Jehovah upon many waters.
029:004 The voice of Jehovah is powerful; The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.
029:005 The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; Yea, Jehovah breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
029:006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.
029:007 The voice of Jehovah cleaveth the flames of fire.
029:008 The voice of Jehovah shaketh the wilderness; Jehovah shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
029:009 The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, And strippeth the forests bare: And in his temple everything saith, Glory.
029:010 Jehovah sat as King at the Flood; Yea, Jehovah sitteth as King for ever.
029:011 Jehovah will give strength unto his people; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.
030:001 ¶  I will extol thee, O Jehovah; For thou hast raised me up, And hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
030:002 O Jehovah my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
030:003 O Jehovah, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
030:004 Sing praise unto Jehovah, O ye saints of his, And give thanks to his holy memorial name.
030:005 For his anger is but for a moment; His favor is for a life-time: Weeping may tarry for the night, But joy cometh in the morning.
030:006 As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved.
030:007 Thou, Jehovah, of thy favor hadst made my mountain to stand strong: Thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled.
030:008 I cried to thee, O Jehovah; And unto Jehovah I made supplication:
030:009 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
030:010 Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me: Jehovah, be thou my helper.
030:011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
030:012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
031:001 ¶  In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge; Let me never be put to shame: Deliver me in thy righteousness.
031:002 Bow down thine ear unto me; Deliver me speedily: Be thou to me a strong rock, A house of defence to save me.
031:003 For thou art my rock and my fortress; Therefore for thy name’s sake lead me and guide me.
031:004 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid privily for me; For thou art my stronghold.
031:005 Into thy hand I commend my spirit: Thou hast redeemed me, O Jehovah, thou God of truth.
031:006 I hate them that regard lying vanities; But I trust in Jehovah.
031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in thy lovingkindness; For thou hast seen my affliction: Thou hast known my soul in adversities;
031:008 And thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; Thou hast set my feet in a large place.
031:009 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress: Mine eye wasteth away with grief, yea, my soul and my body.
031:010 For my life is spent with sorrow, And my years with sighing: My strength faileth because of mine iniquity, And my bones are wasted away.
031:011 Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach, Yea, unto my neighbors exceedingly, And a fear to mine acquaintance: They that did see me without fled from me.
031:012 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.
031:013 For I have heard the defaming of many, Terror on every side: While they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.
031:014 But I trusted in thee, O Jehovah: I said, Thou art my God.
031:015 My times are in thy hand: Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
031:016 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: Save me in thy lovingkindness.
031:017 Let me not be put to shame, O Jehovah; For I have called upon thee: Let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol.
031:018 Let the lying lips be dumb, Which speak against the righteous insolently, With pride and contempt.
031:019 Oh how great is thy goodness, Which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, Which thou hast wrought for them that take refuge in thee, Before the sons of men!
031:020 In the covert of thy presence wilt thou hide them from the plottings of man: Thou wilt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
031:021 Blessed be Jehovah; For he hath showed me his marvellous lovingkindness in a strong city.
031:022 As for me, I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications When I cried unto thee.
031:023 Oh love Jehovah, all ye his saints: Jehovah preserveth the faithful, And plentifully rewardeth him that dealeth proudly.
031:024 Be strong, and let your heart take courage, All ye that hope in Jehovah.
032:001 ¶  Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
032:002 Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile.
032:003 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away Through my groaning all the day long.
032:004 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: My moisture was changed as with the drought of summer. [Selah
032:005 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, And mine iniquity did I not hide: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah; And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. [Selah
032:006 For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him.
032:007 Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from trouble; Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. [Selah
032:008 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.
032:009 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, Else they will not come near unto thee.
032:010 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; But he that trusteth in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about.
032:011 Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous; And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
033:001 ¶  Rejoice in Jehovah, O ye righteous: Praise is comely for the upright.
033:002 Give thanks unto Jehovah with the harp: Sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings.
033:003 Sing unto him a new song; Play skilfully with a loud noise.
033:004 For the word of Jehovah is right; And all his work is done in faithfulness.
033:005 He loveth righteousness and justice: The earth is full of the lovingkindness of Jehovah.
033:006 By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
033:007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap: He layeth up the deeps in store-houses.
033:008 Let all the earth fear Jehovah: Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
033:009 For he spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.
033:010 Jehovah bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
033:011 The counsel of Jehovah standeth fast for ever, The thoughts of his heart to all generations.
033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, The people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
033:013 Jehovah looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men;
033:014 From the place of his habitation he looketh forth Upon all the inhabitants of the earth,
033:015 He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, That considereth all their works.
033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of a host: A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
033:017 A horse is a vain thing for safety; Neither doth he deliver any by his great power.
033:018 Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear him, Upon them that hope in his lovingkindness;
033:019 To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine.
033:020 Our soul hath waited for Jehovah: He is our help and our shield.
033:021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, Because we have trusted in his holy name.
033:022 Let thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, According as we have hoped in thee.
034:001 ¶  I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
034:002 My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad.
034:003 Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together.
034:004 I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, And delivered me from all my fears.
034:005 They looked unto him, and were radiant; And their faces shall never be confounded.
034:006 This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, And saved him out of all his troubles.
034:007 The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, And delivereth them.
034:008 Oh taste and see that Jehovah is good: Blessed is the man that taketh refuge in him.
034:009 Oh fear Jehovah, ye his saints; For there is no want to them that fear him.
034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; But they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing.
034:011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
034:012 What man is he that desireth life, And loveth many days, that he may see good?
034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking guile.
034:014 Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it.
034:015 The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous, And his ears are open unto their cry.
034:016 The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
034:017 The righteous cried, and Jehovah heard, And delivered them out of all their troubles.
034:018 Jehovah is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.
034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But Jehovah delivereth him out of them all.
034:020 He keepeth all his bones: Not one of them is broken.
034:021 Evil shall slay the wicked; And they that hate the righteous shall be condemned.
034:022 Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants; And none of them that take refuge in him shall be condemned.
035:001 ¶  Strive thou, O Jehovah, with them that strive with me: Fight thou against them that fight against me.
035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, And stand up for my help.
035:003 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue me: Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
035:004 Let them be put to shame and brought to dishonor that seek after my soul: Let them be turned back and confounded that devise my hurt.
035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind, And the angel of Jehovah driving them on.
035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery, And the angel of Jehovah pursuing them.
035:007 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit; Without cause have they digged a pit for my soul.
035:008 Let destruction come upon him unawares; And let his net that he hath hid catch himself: With destruction let him fall therein.
035:009 And my soul shall be joyful in Jehovah: It shall rejoice in his salvation.
035:010 All my bones shall say, Jehovah, who is like unto thee, Who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, Yea, the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him?
035:011 Unrighteous witnesses rise up; They ask me of things that I know not.
035:012 They reward me evil for good, To the bereaving of my soul.
035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I afflicted my soul with fasting; And my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
035:014 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I bowed down mourning, as one that bewaileth his mother.
035:015 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: The abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; They did tear me, and ceased not:
035:016 Like the profane mockers in feasts, They gnashed upon me with their teeth.
035:017 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? Rescue my soul from their destructions, My darling from the lions.
035:018 I will give thee thanks in the great assembly: I will praise thee among much people.
035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
035:020 For they speak not peace; But they devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.
035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me; They said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
035:022 Thou hast seen it, O Jehovah; Keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.
035:023 Stir up thyself, and awake to the justice due unto me, Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
035:024 Judge me, O Jehovah my God, according to thy righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.
035:025 Let them not say in their heart, Aha, so would we have it: Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
035:026 Let them be put to shame and confounded together that rejoice at my hurt: Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against me.
035:027 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause: Yea, let them say continually, Jehovah be magnified, Who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
035:028 And my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness And of thy praise all the day long.
036:001 ¶  The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.
036:002 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, That his iniquity will not be found out and be hated.
036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: He hath ceased to be wise and to do good.
036:004 He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; He setteth himself in a way that is not good; He abhorreth not evil.
036:005 Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, is in the heavens; Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies.
036:006 Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; Thy judgments are a great deep: O Jehovah, thou preservest man and beast.
036:007 How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.
036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; And thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
036:009 For with thee is the fountain of life: In thy light shall we see light.
036:010 Oh continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee, And thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
036:011 Let not the foot of pride come against me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
036:012 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
037:001 ¶  Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.
037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, And wither as the green herb.
037:003 Trust in Jehovah, and do good; Dwell in the land, and feed on his faithfulness.
037:004 Delight thyself also in Jehovah; And he will give thee the desires of thy heart.
037:005 Commit thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.
037:006 And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, And thy justice as the noon-day.
037:007 Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing.
037:009 For evil-doers shall be cut off; But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land.
037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be.
037:011 But the meek shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
037:012 The wicked plotteth against the just, And gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
037:013 The Lord will laugh at him; For he seeth that his day is coming.
037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way.
037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, And their bows shall be broken.
037:016 Better is a little that the righteous hath Than the abundance of many wicked.
037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.
037:018 Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; And their inheritance shall be for ever.
037:019 They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
037:020 But the wicked shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; In smoke shall they consume away.
037:021 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.
037:022 For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land; And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.
037:023 A man’s goings are established of Jehovah; And he delighteth in his way.
037:024 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand.
037:025 I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread.
037:026 All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; And his seed is blessed.
037:027 Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell for evermore.
037:028 For Jehovah loveth justice, And forsaketh not his saints; They are preserved for ever: But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell therein for ever.
037:030 The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, And his tongue speaketh justice.
037:031 The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps shall slide.
037:032 The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him.
037:033 Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged.
037:034 Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.
037:036 But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
037:037 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; For there is a happy end to the man of peace.
037:038 As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together; The end of the wicked shall be cut off.
037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
037:040 And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them; He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, Because they have taken refuge in him.
038:001 ¶  O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
038:002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, And thy hand presseth me sore.
038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
038:004 For mine iniquities are gone over my head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
038:005 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, Because of my foolishness.
038:006 I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
038:007 For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh.
038:008 I am faint and sore bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
038:009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; And my groaning is not hid from thee.
038:010 My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me: As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off.
038:012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, And meditate deceits all the day long.
038:013 But I, as a deaf man, hear not; And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
038:014 Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, And in whose mouth are no reproofs.
038:015 For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope: Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.
038:016 For I said, Lest they rejoice over me: When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
038:017 For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me.
038:018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
038:019 But mine enemies are lively, and are strong; And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
038:020 They also that render evil for good Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.
038:021 Forsake me not, O Jehovah: O my God, be not far from me.
038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
039:001 ¶  I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me.
039:002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred.
039:003 My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned: Then spake I with my tongue:
039:004 Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am.
039:005 Behold, thou hast made my days as handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. [Selah
039:006 Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
039:007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.
039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: Make me not the reproach of the foolish.
039:009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; Because thou didst it.
039:010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.
039:011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely every man is vanity. [Selah
039:012 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry; Hold not thy peace at my tears: For I am a stranger with thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
039:013 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go hence, and be no more.
040:001 ¶  I waited patiently for Jehovah; And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
040:002 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay; And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
040:003 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: Many shall see it, and fear, And shall trust in Jehovah.
040:004 Blessed is the man that maketh Jehovah his trust, And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
040:005 Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, And thy thoughts which are to us-ward; They cannot be set in order unto thee; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered.
040:006 Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; Mine ears hast thou opened: Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required.
040:007 Then said I, Lo, I am come; In the roll of the book it is written of me:
040:008 I delight to do thy will, O my God; Yea, thy law is within my heart.
040:009 I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly; Lo, I will not refrain my lips, O Jehovah, thou knowest.
040:010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great assembly.
040:011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Jehovah; Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
040:012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about; Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head; And my heart hath failed me.
040:013 Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me: Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.
040:014 Let them be put to shame and confounded together That seek after my soul to destroy it: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt.
040:015 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame That say unto me, Aha, aha.
040:016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: Let such as love thy salvation say continually, Jehovah be magnified.
040:017 But I am poor and needy; Yet the Lord thinketh upon me: Thou art my help and my deliverer; Make no tarrying, O my God.
041:001 ¶  Blessed is he that considereth the poor: Jehovah will deliver him in the day of evil.
041:002 Jehovah will preserve him, and keep him alive, And he shall be blessed upon the earth; And deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies.
041:003 Jehovah will support him upon the couch of languishing: Thou makest all his bed in his sickness.
041:004 I said, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me: Heal my soul; For I have sinned against thee.
041:005 Mine enemies speak evil against me, saying, When will he die, and his name perish?
041:006 And if he come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; His heart gathereth iniquity to itself: When he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
041:007 All that hate me whisper together against me; Against me do they devise my hurt.
041:008 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him; And now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
041:009 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, Who did eat of my bread, Hath lifted up his heel against me.
041:010 But thou, O Jehovah, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, That I may requite them.
041:011 By this I know that thou delightest in me, Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, And settest me before thy face for ever.
041:013 Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
042:001 ¶  As the hart panteth after the water brooks, So panteth my soul after thee, O God.
042:002 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: When shall I come and appear before God?
042:003 My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
042:004 These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, How I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.
042:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him For the help of his countenance.
042:006 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: Therefore do I remember thee from the land of the Jordan, And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.
042:007 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterfalls: All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
042:008 Yet Jehovah will command his lovingkindness in the day-time; And in the night his song shall be with me, Even a prayer unto the God of my life.
042:009 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
042:010 As with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me, While they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
042:011 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; For I shall yet praise him, Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
043:001 ¶  Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: Oh deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
043:002 For thou art the God of my strength; Why hast thou cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
043:003 Oh send out thy light and thy truth; Let them lead me: Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, And to thy tabernacles.
043:004 Then will I go unto the altar of God, Unto God my exceeding joy; And upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God.
043:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; For I shall yet praise him, Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
044:001 ¶  We have heard with our ears, O God, Our fathers have told us, What work thou didst in their days, In the days of old.
044:002 Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand; But them thou didst plant: Thou didst afflict the peoples; But them thou didst spread abroad.
044:003 For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, Because thou wast favorable unto them.
044:004 Thou art my King, O God: Command deliverance for Jacob.
044:005 Through thee will we push down our adversaries: Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, Neither shall my sword save me.
044:007 But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And hast put them to shame that hate us.
044:008 In God have we made our boast all the day long, And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. [Selah
044:009 But now thou hast cast us off, and brought us to dishonor, And goest not forth with our hosts.
044:010 Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; And they that hate us take spoil for themselves.
044:011 Thou hast made us like sheep appointed for food, And hast scattered us among the nations.
044:012 Thou sellest thy people for nought, And hast not increased thy wealth by their price.
044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us.
044:014 Thou makest us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.
044:015 All the day long is my dishonor before me, And the shame of my face hath covered me,
044:016 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth, By reason of the enemy and the avenger.
044:017 All this is come upon us; Yet have we not forgotten thee, Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
044:018 Our heart is not turned back, Neither have our steps declined from thy way,
044:019 That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.
044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;
044:021 Will not God search this out? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
044:023 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise, cast us not off for ever.
044:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: Our body cleaveth unto the earth.
044:026 Rise up for our help, And redeem us for thy lovingkindness’ sake.
045:001 ¶  My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I speak the things which I have made touching the king: My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
045:002 Thou art fairer than the children of men; Grace is poured into thy lips: Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
045:003 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, Thy glory and thy majesty.
045:004 And in thy majesty ride on prosperously, Because of truth and meekness and righteousness: And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
045:005 Thine arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under thee; They are in the heart of the king’s enemies.
045:006 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
045:007 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness: Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
045:008 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.
045:009 Kings’ daughters are among thy honorable women: At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; Forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house:
045:011 So will the king desire thy beauty; For he is thy lord; And reverence thou him.
045:012 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; The rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.
045:013 The king’s daughter within the palace is all glorious: Her clothing is inwrought with gold.
045:014 She shall be led unto the king in broidered work: The virgins her companions that follow her Shall be brought unto thee.
045:015 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: They shall enter into the king’s palace.
045:016 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, Whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.
045:017 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: Therefore shall the peoples give thee thanks for ever and ever.
046:001 ¶  God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.
046:002 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, And though the mountains be shaken into the heart of the seas;
046:003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, Though the mountains tremble with the swelling thereof. [Selah
046:004 There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
046:005 God is in the midst of her; She shall not be moved: God will help her, and that right early.
046:006 The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved: He uttered his voice, the earth melted.
046:007 Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. [elah
046:008 Come, behold the works of Jehovah, What desolations he hath made in the earth.
046:009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; He burneth the chariots in the fire.
046:010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
046:011 Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. [Selah
047:001 ¶  Oh clap your hands, all ye peoples; Shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
047:002 For Jehovah Most High is terrible; He is a great King over all the earth.
047:003 He subdueth peoples under us, And nations under our feet.
047:004 He chooseth our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom he loved. [Selah
047:005 God is gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.
047:006 Sing praise to God, sing praises: Sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
047:007 For God is the King of all the earth: Sing ye praises with understanding.
047:008 God reigneth over the nations: God sitteth upon his holy throne.
047:009 The princes of the peoples are gathered together To be the people of the God of Abraham: For the shields of the earth belong unto God; He is greatly exalted.
048:001 ¶  Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
048:002 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, The city of the great King.
048:003 God hath made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.
048:004 For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together.
048:005 They saw it, then were they amazed; They were dismayed, they hasted away.
048:006 Trembling took hold of them there, Pain, as of a woman in travail.
048:007 With the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish.
048:008 As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. [Selah
048:009 We have thought on thy lovingkindness, O God, In the midst of thy temple.
048:010 As is thy name, O God, So is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
048:011 Let mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of thy judgments.
048:012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her; Number the towers thereof;
048:013 Mark ye well her bulwarks; Consider her palaces: That ye may tell it to the generation following.
048:014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: He will be our guide even unto death.
049:001 ¶  Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,
049:002 Both low and high, Rich and poor together.
049:003 My mouth shall speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
049:004 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
049:005 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?
049:006 They that trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
049:007 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him;
049:008 (For the redemption of their life is costly, And it faileth for ever;)
049:009 That he should still live alway, That he should not see corruption.
049:010 For he shall see it. Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.
049:011 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, And their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.
049:012 But man being in honor abideth not: He is like the beasts that perish.
049:013 This their way is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings. [Selah
049:014 They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, That there be no habitation for it.
049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me. [Selah
049:016 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased.
049:017 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him.
049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself,)
049:019 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light.
049:020 Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, Is like the beasts that perish.
050:001 ¶  The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, hath spoken, And called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth.
050:003 Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence: A fire devoureth before him, And it is very tempestuous round about him.
050:004 He calleth to the heavens above, And to the earth, that he may judge his people:
050:005 Gather my saints together unto me, Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
050:006 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; For God is judge himself. [Selah
050:007 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, even thy God.
050:008 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; And thy burnt-offerings are continually before me.
050:009 I will take no bullock out of thy house, Nor he-goats out of thy folds.
050:010 For every beast of the forest is mine, And the cattle upon a thousand hills.
050:011 I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.
050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?
050:014 Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; And pay thy vows unto the Most High:
050:015 And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
050:016 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, And that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth?
050:017 Seeing thou hatest instruction, And castest my words behind thee?
050:018 When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, And hast been partaker with adulterers.
050:019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, And thy tongue frameth deceit.
050:020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; Thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.
050:021 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself: But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.
050:022 Now consider this, ye that forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:
050:023 Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me; And to him that ordereth his way aright Will I show the salvation of God.
051:001 ¶  Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
051:002 Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin.
051:003 For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me.
051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, And done that which is evil in thy sight; That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, And be clear when thou judgest.
051:005 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity; And in sin did my mother conceive me.
051:006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts; And in the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom.
051:007 Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
051:008 Make me to hear joy and gladness, That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
051:009 Hide thy face from my sins, And blot out all mine iniquities.
051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; And renew a right spirit within me.
051:011 Cast me not away from thy presence; And take not thy holy Spirit from me.
051:012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; And uphold me with a willing spirit.
051:013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; And sinners shall be converted unto thee.
051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation; And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
051:015 O Lord, open thou my lips; And my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
051:016 For thou delightest not in sacrifice; Else would I give it: Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.
051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: A broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
051:018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
051:019 Then will thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, In burnt-offering and in whole burnt-offering: Then will they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
052:001 ¶  Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God endureth continually.
052:002 Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
052:003 Thou lovest evil more than good, And lying rather than to speak righteousness. [Selah
052:004 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
052:005 God will likewise destroy thee for ever; He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, And root thee out of the land of the living. [Selah
052:006 The righteous also shall see it, and fear, And shall laugh at him, saying,
052:007 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness.
052:008 But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.
052:009 I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it; And I will hope in thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints.
053:001 ¶  The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none that doeth good.
053:002 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.
053:003 Every one of them is gone back; They are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And call not upon God?
053:005 There were they in great fear, where no fear was; For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: Thou hast put them to shame, because of God hath rejected them.
053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
054:001 ¶  Save me, O God, by thy name, And judge me in thy might.
054:002 Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.
054:003 For strangers are risen up against me, And violent men have sought after my soul: They have not set God before them. [Selah
054:004 Behold, God is my helper: The Lord is of them that uphold my soul.
054:005 He will requite the evil unto mine enemies: Destroy thou them in thy truth.
054:006 With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good.
054:007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; And mine eye hath seen my desire upon mine enemies.
055:001 ¶  Give ear to my prayer, O God; And hide not thyself from my supplication.
055:002 Attend unto me, and answer me: I am restless in my complaint, and moan,
055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked; For they cast iniquity upon me, And in anger they persecute me.
055:004 My heart is sore pained within me: And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
055:005 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, And horror hath overwhelmed me.
055:006 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then would I fly away, and be at rest.
055:007 Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. [Selah
055:008 I would haste me to a shelter From the stormy wind and tempest.
055:009 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue; For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
055:010 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.
055:011 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.
055:012 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; Then I could have borne it: Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; Then I would have hid myself from him:
055:013 But it was thou, a man mine equal, My companion, and my familiar friend.
055:014 We took sweet counsel together; We walked in the house of God with the throng.
055:015 Let death come suddenly upon them, Let them go down alive into Sheol; For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
055:016 As for me, I will call upon God; And Jehovah will save me.
055:017 Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan; And he will hear my voice.
055:018 He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; For they were many that strove with me.
055:019 God will hear, and answer them, Even he that abideth of old, [Selah The men who have no changes, And who fear not God.
055:020 He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: He hath profaned his covenant.
055:021 His mouth was smooth as butter, But his heart was war: His words were softer than oil, Yet were they drawn swords.
055:022 Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee: He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.
055:023 But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; But I will trust in thee.
056:001 ¶  Be merciful unto me, O God; For man would swallow me up: All the day long he fighting oppresseth me.
056:002 Mine enemies would swallow me up all the day long; For they are many that fight proudly against me.
056:003 What time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee.
056:004 In God (I will praise his word), In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can flesh do unto me?
056:005 All the day long they wrest my words: All their thoughts are against me for evil.
056:006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, They mark my steps, Even as they have waited for my soul.
056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
056:008 Thou numberest my wanderings: Put thou my tears into thy bottle; Are they not in thy book?
056:009 Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call: This I know, that God is for me.
056:010 In God (I will praise his word), In Jehovah (I will praise his word),
056:011 In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can man do unto me?
056:012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render thank-offerings unto thee.
056:013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: Hast thou not delivered my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?
057:001 ¶  Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; For my soul taketh refuge in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, Until these calamities be overpast.
057:002 I will cry unto God Most High, Unto God that performeth all things for me.
057:003 He will send from heaven, and save me, When he that would swallow me up reproacheth; [Selah God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth.
057:004 My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
057:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let thy glory be above all the earth.
057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. [Selah
057:007 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.
057:008 Awake up, my glory; Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.
057:009 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
057:010 For thy lovingkindness is great unto the heavens, And thy truth unto the skies.
057:011 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let thy glory be above all the earth.
058:001 ¶  Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
058:002 Nay, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.
058:003 The wicked are estranged from the womb: They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,
058:005 Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, Charming never so wisely.
058:006 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.
058:007 Let them melt away as water that runneth apace: When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.
058:008 Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away, Like the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun.
058:009 Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.
058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;
058:011 So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.
059:001 ¶  Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: Set me on high from them that rise up against me.
059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, And save me from the bloodthirsty men.
059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; The mighty gather themselves together against me: Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.
059:004 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: Awake thou to help me, and behold.
059:005 Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel, Arise to visit all the nations: Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. [Selah
059:006 They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go round about the city.
059:007 Behold, they belch out with their mouth; Swords are in their lips: For who, say they, doth hear?
059:008 But thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt have all the nations in derision.
059:009 Because of his strength I will give heed unto thee; For God is my high tower.
059:010 My God with his lovingkindness will meet me: God will let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
059:011 Slay them not, lest my people forget: Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
059:012 For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for cursing and lying which they speak.
059:013 Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more: And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, Unto the ends of the earth. [Selah
059:014 And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog, And go round about the city.
059:015 They shall wander up and down for food, And tarry all night if they be not satisfied.
059:016 But I will sing of thy strength; Yea, I will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning: For thou hast been my high tower, And a refuge in the day of my distress.
059:017 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises: For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
060:001 ¶  O God thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; oh restore us again.
060:002 Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou hast rent it: Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
060:003 Thou hast showed thy people hard things: Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.
060:004 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. [Selah
060:005 That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
060:006 God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.
060:008 Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, shout thou because of me.
060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
060:010 Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.
060:011 Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.
060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly; For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
061:001 ¶  Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my prayer.
061:002 From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
061:003 For thou hast been a refuge for me, A strong tower from the enemy.
061:004 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. [Selah
061:005 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.
061:006 Thou wilt prolong the king’s life; His years shall be as many generations.
061:007 He shall abide before God for ever: Oh prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
061:008 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, That I may daily perform my vows.
062:001 ¶  My soul waiteth in silence for God only: From him cometh my salvation.
062:002 He only is my rock and my salvation: He is my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved.
062:003 How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay him, all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
062:004 They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. [Selah
062:005 My soul, wait thou in silence for God only; For my expectation is from him.
062:006 He only is my rock and my salvation: He is my high tower; I shall not be moved.
062:007 With God is my salvation and my glory: The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
062:008 Trust in him at all times, ye people; Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. [Selah
062:009 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are together lighter than vanity.
062:010 Trust not in oppression, And become not vain in robbery: If riches increase, set not your heart thereon.
062:011 God hath spoken once, Twice have I heard this, That power belongeth unto God.
062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth lovingkindness; For thou renderest to every man according to his work.
063:001 ¶  O God, thou art my God; earnestly will I seek thee: My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry and weary land, where no water is.
063:002 So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary, To see thy power and thy glory.
063:003 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, My lips shall praise thee.
063:004 So will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips;
063:006 When I remember thee upon my bed, And meditate on thee in the night-watches.
063:007 For thou hast been my help, And in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
063:008 My soul followeth hard after thee: Thy right hand upholdeth me.
063:009 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
063:010 They shall be given over to the power of the sword: They shall be a portion for foxes.
063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God: Every one that sweareth by him shall glory; For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
064:001 ¶  Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
064:002 Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, From the tumult of the workers of iniquity;
064:003 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, And have aimed their arrows, even bitter words,
064:004 That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
064:005 They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who will see them?
064:006 They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, say they, a diligent search: And the inward thought and the heart of every one is deep.
064:007 But God will shoot at them; With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded.
064:008 So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them: All that see them shall wag the head.
064:009 And all men shall fear; And they shall declare the work of God, And shall wisely consider of his doing.
064:010 The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take refuge in him; And all the upright in heart shall glory.
065:001 ¶  Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion; And unto thee shall the vow be performed.
065:002 O thou that hearest prayer, Unto thee shall all flesh come.
065:003 Iniquities prevail against me: As for our transgressions, thou wilt forgive them.
065:004 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, That he may dwell in thy courts: We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, Thy holy temple.
065:005 By terrible things thou wilt answer us in righteousness, Oh God of our salvation, Thou that art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of them that are afar off upon the sea:
065:006 Who by his strength setteth fast the mountains, Being girded about with might;
065:007 Who stilleth the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples.
065:008 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
065:009 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it, Thou greatly enrichest it; The river of God is full of water: Thou providest them grain, when thou hast so prepared the earth.
065:010 Thou waterest its furrows abundantly; Thou settlest the ridges thereof: Thou makest it soft with showers; Thou blessest the springing thereof.
065:011 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; And thy paths drop fatness.
065:012 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; And the hills are girded with joy.
065:013 The pastures are clothed with flocks; The valleys also are covered over with grain; They shout for joy, they also sing.
066:001 ¶  Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth:
066:002 Sing forth the glory of his name: Make his praise glorious.
066:003 Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
066:004 All the earth shall worship thee, And shall sing unto thee; They shall sing to thy name. [Selah
066:005 Come, and see the works of God; He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
066:006 He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot: There did we rejoice in him.
066:007 He ruleth by his might for ever; His eyes observe the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. [Selah
066:008 Oh bless our God, ye peoples, And make the voice of his praise to be heard;
066:009 Who holdeth our soul in life, And suffereth not our feet to be moved.
066:010 For thou, O God, hast proved us: Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
066:011 Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins.
066:012 Thou didst cause men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
066:013 I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows,
066:014 Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spake, when I was in distress.
066:015 I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, With the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. [Selah
066:016 Come, and hear, all ye that fear God, And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
066:017 I cried unto him with my mouth, And he was extolled with my tongue.
066:018 If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear:
066:019 But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
066:020 Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his lovingkindness from me.
067:001 ¶  God be merciful unto us, and bless us, And cause his face to shine upon us; [Selah
067:002 That thy way may be known upon earth, Thy salvation among all nations.
067:003 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee.
067:004 Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy; For thou wilt judge the peoples with equity, And govern the nations upon earth. [Selah
067:005 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee.
067:006 The earth hath yielded its increase: God, even our own God, will bless us.
067:007 God will bless us; And all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
068:001 ¶  Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; Let them also that hate him flee before him.
068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: As wax melteth before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
068:003 But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God: Yea, let them rejoice with gladness.
068:004 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts; His name is Jehovah; and exult ye before him.
068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, Is God in his holy habitation.
068:006 God setteth the solitary in families: He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity; But the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
068:007 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, When thou didst march through the wilderness; [Selah
068:008 The earth trembled, The heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God: Yon Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
068:009 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, Thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
068:010 Thy congregation dwelt therein: Thou, O God, didst prepare of thy goodness for the poor.
068:011 The Lord giveth the word: The women that publish the tidings are a great host.
068:012 Kings of armies flee, they flee; And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil.
068:013 When ye lie among the sheepfolds, It is as the wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold.
068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings therein, It was as when it snoweth in Zalmon.
068:015 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan.
068:016 Why look ye askance, ye high mountains, At the mountain which God hath desired for his abode? Yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever.
068:017 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands; The Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary.
068:018 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led away captives; Thou hast received gifts among men, Yea, among the rebellious also, that Jehovah God might dwell with them.
068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily beareth our burden, Even the God who is our salvation. [Selah
068:020 God is unto us a God of deliverances; And unto Jehovah the Lord belongeth escape from death.
068:021 But God will smite through the head of his enemies, The hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his guiltiness.
068:022 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring them again from the depths of the sea;
068:023 That thou mayest crush them, dipping thy foot in blood, That the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies.
068:024 They have seen thy goings, O God, Even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
068:025 The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, In the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels.
068:026 Bless ye God in the congregations, Even the Lord, ye that are of the fountain of Israel.
068:027 There is little Benjamin their ruler, The princes of Judah and their council, The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
068:029 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem Kings shall bring presents unto thee.
068:030 Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver: He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war.
068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto God.
068:032 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; Oh sing praises unto the Lord; [Selah
068:033 To him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens, which are of old; Lo, he uttereth his voice, a mighty voice.
068:034 Ascribe ye strength unto God: His excellency is over Israel, And his strength is in the skies.
068:035 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: The God of Israel, he giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
069:001 ¶  Save me, O God; For the waters are come in unto my soul.
069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
069:003 I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
069:004 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I took not away I have to restore.
069:005 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; And my sins are not hid from thee.
069:006 Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.
069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; Shame hath covered my face.
069:008 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my mother’s children.
069:009 For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.
069:010 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, That was to my reproach.
069:011 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword unto them.
069:012 They that sit in the gate talk of me; And I am the song of the drunkards.
069:013 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, Answer me in the truth of thy salvation.
069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
069:015 Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, Neither let the deep shallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.
069:016 Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy lovingkindness is good: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.
069:017 And hide not thy face from thy servant; For I am in distress; answer me speedily.
069:018 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of mine enemies.
069:019 Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: Mine adversaries are all before thee.
069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.
069:021 They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
069:022 Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, let it become a trap.
069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see; And make their loins continually to shake.
069:024 Pour out thine indignation upon them, And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.
069:025 Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.
069:026 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.
069:027 Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And let them not come into thy righteousness.
069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of life, And not be written with the righteous.
069:029 But I am poor and sorrowful: Let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving.
069:031 And it will please Jehovah better than an ox, Or a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
069:032 The meek have seen it, and are glad: Ye that seek after God, let your heart live.
069:033 For Jehovah heareth the needy, And despiseth not his prisoners.
069:034 Let heaven and earth praise him, The seas, and everything that moveth therein.
069:035 For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.
069:036 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it; And they that love his name shall dwell therein.
070:001 ¶  Make haste, O God, to deliver me; Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.
070:002 Let them be put to shame and confounded That seek after my soul: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt.
070:003 Let them be turned back by reason of their shame That say, Aha, aha.
070:004 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; And let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
070:005 But I am poor and needy; Make haste unto me, O God: Thou art my help and my deliverer; O Jehovah, make no tarrying.
071:001 ¶  In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge: Let me never be put to shame.
071:002 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me: Bow down thine ear unto me, and save me.
071:003 Be thou to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: Thou hast given commandment to save me; For thou art my rock and my fortress.
071:004 Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
071:005 For thou art my hope, O Lord Jehovah: Thou art my trust from my youth.
071:006 By thee have I been holden up from the womb; Thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: My praise shall be continually of thee.
071:007 I am as a wonder unto many; But thou art my strong refuge.
071:008 My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, And with thy honor all the day.
071:009 Cast me not off in the time of old age; Forsake me not when my strength faileth.
071:010 For mine enemies speak concerning me; And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,
071:011 Saying, God hath forsaken him: Pursue and take him; For there is none to deliver.
071:012 O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me.
071:013 Let them be put to shame and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.
071:014 But I will hope continually, And will praise thee yet more and more.
071:015 My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness, And of thy salvation all the day; For I know not the numbers thereof.
071:016 I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Jehovah: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
071:017 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth; And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
071:018 Yea, even when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not, Until I have declared thy strength unto the next generation, Thy might to every one that is to come.
071:019 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high; Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto thee?
071:020 Thou, who hast showed us many and sore troubles, Wilt quicken us again, And wilt bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
071:021 Increase thou my greatness, And turn again and comfort me.
071:022 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, Even thy truth, O my God: Unto thee will I sing praises with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
071:023 My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises unto thee; And my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
071:024 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long; For they are put to shame, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt.
072:001 ¶  Give the king thy judgments, O God, And thy righteousness unto the king’s son.
072:002 He will judge thy people with righteousness, And thy poor with justice.
072:003 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, And the hills, in righteousness.
072:004 He will judge the poor of the people, He will save the children of the needy, And will break in pieces the oppressor.
072:005 They shall fear thee while the sun endureth, And so long as the moon, throughout all generations.
072:006 He will come down like rain upon the mown grass, As showers that water the earth.
072:007 In his days shall the righteous flourish, And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.
072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, And from the River unto the ends of the earth.
072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; And his enemies shall lick the dust.
072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute: The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
072:011 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; All nations shall serve him.
072:012 For he will deliver the needy when he crieth, And the poor, that hath no helper.
072:013 He will have pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he will save.
072:014 He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence; And precious will their blood be in his sight:
072:015 And they shall live; and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: And men shall pray for him continually; They shall bless him all the day long.
072:016 There shall be abundance of grain in the earth upon the top of the mountains; The fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
072:017 His name shall endure for ever; His name shall be continued as long as the sun: And men shall be blessed in him; All nations shall call him happy.
072:018 Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, Who only doeth wondrous things:
072:019 And blessed be his glorious name for ever; And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen.
072:020 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
073:001 ¶  Surely God is good to Israel, Even to such as are pure in heart.
073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped.
073:003 For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
073:004 For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm.
073:005 They are not in trouble as other men; Neither are they plagued like other men.
073:006 Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment.
073:007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish.
073:008 They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily.
073:009 They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth.
073:010 Therefore his people return hither: And waters of a full cup are drained by them.
073:011 And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?
073:012 Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.
073:013 Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;
073:014 For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning.
073:015 If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.
073:016 When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;
073:017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end.
073:018 Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction.
073:019 How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.
073:020 As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.
073:021 For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:
073:022 So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.
073:023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand.
073:024 Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory.
073:025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
073:026 My flesh and my heart faileth; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
073:027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, departing from thee.
073:028 But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works.
074:001 ¶  O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
074:002 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old, Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; And mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
074:003 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.
074:004 Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly; They have set up their ensigns for signs.
074:005 They seemed as men that lifted up Axes upon a thicket of trees.
074:006 And now all the carved work thereof They break down with hatchet and hammers.
074:007 They have set thy sanctuary on fire; They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name by casting it to the ground.
074:008 They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
074:009 We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
074:010 How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
074:011 Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? Pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them.
074:012 Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
074:013 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.
074:014 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
074:015 Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers.
074:016 The day is thine, the night also is thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
074:017 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast made summer and winter.
074:018 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah, And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name.
074:019 Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast: Forget not the life of thy poor for ever.
074:020 Have respect unto the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
074:021 Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed: Let the poor and needy praise thy name.
074:022 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.
074:023 Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.
075:001 ¶  We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works.
075:002 When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly.
075:003 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. [Selah
075:004 I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
075:005 Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck.
075:006 For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up.
075:007 But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.
075:008 For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.
075:009 But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
075:010 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
076:001 ¶  In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel.
076:002 In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion.
076:003 There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. [Selah
076:004 Glorious art thou and excellent, From the mountains of prey.
076:005 The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands.
076:006 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.
076:007 Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
076:008 Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,
076:009 When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. [Selah
076:010 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.
076:011 Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
076:012 He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
077:001 ¶  I will cry unto God with my voice, Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me.
077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul refused to be comforted.
077:003 I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. [Selah
077:004 Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
077:005 I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.
077:006 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search.
077:007 Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more?
077:008 Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?
077:009 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? [Selah
077:010 And I said, This is my infirmity; But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.
077:011 I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old.
077:012 I will meditate also upon all thy work, And muse on thy doings.
077:013 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like unto God?
077:014 Thou art the God that doest wonders: Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.
077:015 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. [Selah
077:016 The waters saw thee, O God; The waters saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled.
077:017 The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad.
077:018 The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook.
077:019 Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known.
077:020 Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
078:001 ¶  Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,
078:003 Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.
078:004 We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.
078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;
078:006 That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell them to their children,
078:007 That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,
078:008 And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.
078:010 They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;
078:011 And they forgat his doings, And his wondrous works that he had showed them.
078:012 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
078:013 He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap.
078:014 In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.
078:015 He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.
078:017 Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
078:018 And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.
078:019 Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
078:020 Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?
078:021 Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;
078:022 Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.
078:023 Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;
078:024 And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.
078:025 Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.
078:026 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.
078:027 He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:
078:028 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.
078:029 So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.
078:030 They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,
078:031 When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel.
078:032 For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works.
078:033 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror.
078:034 When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.
078:035 And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.
078:036 But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.
078:037 For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.
078:038 But he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.
078:039 And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
078:040 How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!
078:041 And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.
078:042 They remember not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
078:043 How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,
078:044 And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.
078:045 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.
078:046 He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.
078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost.
078:048 He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
078:049 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.
078:050 He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,
078:051 And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
078:052 But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
078:053 And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
078:054 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.
078:055 He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
078:056 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;
078:057 But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
078:059 When God heard this, he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;
078:060 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;
078:061 And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary’s hand.
078:062 He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance.
078:063 Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.
078:064 Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.
078:065 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
078:066 And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.
078:067 Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.
078:069 And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.
078:070 He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:
078:071 From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
078:072 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
079:001 ¶  O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance; Thy holy temple have they defiled; They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
079:002 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens, The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
079:003 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them.
079:004 We are become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.
079:005 How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
079:006 Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.
079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.
079:008 Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are brought very low.
079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name’s sake.
079:010 Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed Be known among the nations in our sight.
079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;
079:012 And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
079:013 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture Will give thee thanks for ever: We will show forth thy praise to all generations.
080:001 ¶  Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest above the cherubim, shine forth.
080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might, And come to save us.
080:003 Turn us again, O God; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
080:004 O Jehovah God of hosts, How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
080:005 Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure.
080:006 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.
080:007 Turn us again, O God of hosts; And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
080:008 Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.
080:009 Thou preparedst room before it, And it took deep root, and filled the land.
080:010 The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were like cedars of God.
080:011 It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River.
080:012 Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?
080:013 The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
080:014 Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
080:015 And the stock which thy right hand planted, And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
080:016 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
080:017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
080:018 So shall we not go back from thee: Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name.
080:019 Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts; Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
081:001 ¶  Sing aloud unto God our strength: Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
081:002 Raise a song, and bring hither the timbrel, The pleasant harp with the psaltery.
081:003 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast-day.
081:004 For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
081:005 He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, When he went out over the land of Egypt, Where I heard a language that I knew not.
081:006 I removed his shoulder from the burden: His hands were freed from the basket.
081:007 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. [Selah
081:008 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!
081:009 There shall no strange god be in thee; Neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.
081:010 I am Jehovah thy God, Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
081:011 But my people hearkened not to my voice; And Israel would none of me.
081:012 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, That they might walk in their own counsels.
081:013 Oh that my people would hearken unto me, That Israel would walk in my ways!
081:014 I would soon subdue their enemies, And turn my hand against their adversaries.
081:015 The haters of Jehovah should submit themselves unto him: But their time should endure for ever.
081:016 He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat; And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.
082:001 ¶  God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods.
082:002 How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? [Selah
082:003 Judge the poor and fatherless: Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
082:004 Rescue the poor and needy: Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
082:005 They know not, neither do they understand; They walk to and fro in darkness: All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
082:006 I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High.
082:007 Nevertheless ye shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes.
082:008 Arise, O God, judge the earth; For thou shalt inherit all the nations.
083:001 ¶  O God, keep not thou silence: Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
083:002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
083:003 Thy take crafty counsel against thy people, And consult together against thy hidden ones.
083:004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
083:005 For they have consulted together with one consent; Against thee do they make a covenant:
083:006 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes;
083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:
083:008 Assyria also is joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot. [Selah
083:009 Do thou unto them as unto Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
083:010 Who perished at Endor, Who became as dung for the earth.
083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;
083:012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession The habitations of God.
083:013 O my God, make them like the whirling dust; As stubble before the wind.
083:014 As the fire that burneth the forest, And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire,
083:015 So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm.
083:016 Fill their faces with confusion, That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.
083:017 Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; Yea, let them be confounded and perish;
083:018 That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, Art the Most High over all the earth.
084:001 ¶  How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts!
084:002 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of Jehovah; My heart and my flesh cry out unto the living God.
084:003 Yea, the sparrow hath found her a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, My King, and my God.
084:004 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: They will be still praising thee. [Selah
084:005 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; In whose heart are the highways to Zion.
084:006 Passing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; Yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.
084:007 They go from strength to strength; Every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.
084:008 O Jehovah God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob. [Selah
084:009 Behold, O God our shield, And look upon the face of thine anointed.
084:010 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
084:011 For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield: Jehovah will give grace and glory; No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
084:012 O Jehovah of hosts, Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
085:001 ¶  Jehovah, thou hast been favorable unto thy land; Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
085:002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; Thou hast covered all their sin. [Selah
085:003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; Thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
085:004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, And cause thine indignation toward us to cease.
085:005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
085:006 Wilt thou not quicken us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee?
085:007 Show us thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, And grant us thy salvation.
085:008 I will hear what God Jehovah will speak; For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: But let them not turn again to folly.
085:009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.
085:010 Mercy and truth are met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
085:011 Truth springeth out of the earth; And righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
085:012 Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good; And our land shall yield its increase.
085:013 Righteousness shall go before him, And shall make his footsteps a way to walk in.
086:001 ¶  Bow down thine ear, O Jehovah, and answer me; For I am poor and needy.
086:002 Preserve my soul; For I am godly: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
086:003 Be merciful unto me, O Lord; For unto thee do I cry all the day long.
086:004 Rejoice the soul of thy servant; For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
086:005 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in lovingkindness unto all them that call upon thee.
086:006 Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer; And hearken unto the voice of my supplications.
086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee; For thou wilt answer me.
086:008 There is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord; Neither are there any works like unto thy works.
086:009 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; And they shall glorify thy name.
086:010 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: Thou art God alone.
086:011 Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; I will walk in thy truth: Unite my heart to fear thy name.
086:012 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; And I will glorify thy name for evermore.
086:013 For great is thy lovingkindness toward me; And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
086:014 O God, the proud are risen up against me, And a company of violent men have sought after my soul, And have not set thee before them.
086:015 But thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.
086:016 Oh turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; Give thy strength unto thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid.
086:017 Show me a token for good, That they who hate me may see it, and be put to shame, Because thou, Jehovah, hast helped me, and comforted me.
087:001 ¶  His foundation is in the holy mountains.
087:002 Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob.
087:003 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. [Selah
087:004 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This one was born there.
087:005 Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; And the Most High himself will establish her.
087:006 Jehovah will count, when he writeth up the peoples, This one was born there. [Selah
087:007 They that sing as well as they that dance shall say, All my fountains are in thee.
088:001 ¶  O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee.
088:002 Let my prayer enter into thy presence; Incline thine ear unto my cry.
088:003 For my soul is full of troubles, And my life draweth nigh unto Sheol.
088:004 I am reckoned with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that hath no help,
088:005 Cast off among the dead, Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom thou rememberest no more, And they are cut off from thy hand.
088:006 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the deeps.
088:007 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. [Selah
088:008 Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
088:009 Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction: I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah; I have spread forth my hands unto thee.
088:010 Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Shall they that are decreased arise and praise thee? [Selah
088:011 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or thy faithfulness in Destruction?
088:012 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
088:013 But unto thee, O Jehovah, have I cried; And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.
088:014 Jehovah, why castest thou off my soul? Why hidest thou thy face from me?
088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
088:016 Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.
088:017 They came round about me like water all the day long; They compassed me about together.
088:018 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, And mine acquaintance into darkness.
089:001 ¶  I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah for ever: With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
089:002 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever; Thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens.
089:003 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant:
089:004 Thy seed will I establish for ever, And build up thy throne to all generations. [Selah
089:005 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Jehovah; Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
089:006 For who in the skies can be compared unto Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto Jehovah,
089:007 A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, And to be feared above all them that are round about him?
089:008 O Jehovah God of hosts, Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.
089:009 Thou rulest the pride of the sea: When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
089:010 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.
089:011 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
089:012 The north and the south, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.
089:013 Thou hast a mighty arm; Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
089:014 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne: Lovingkindness and truth go before thy face.
089:015 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance.
089:016 In thy name do they rejoice all the day; And in thy righteousness are they exalted.
089:017 For thou art the glory of their strength; And in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.
089:018 For our shield belongeth unto Jehovah; And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
089:019 Then thou spakest in vision to thy saints, And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
089:020 I have found David my servant; With my holy oil have I anointed him:
089:021 With whom my hand shall be established; Mine arm also shall strengthen him.
089:022 The enemy shall not exact from him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
089:023 And I will beat down his adversaries before him, And smite them that hate him.
089:024 But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him; And in my name shall his horn be exalted.
089:025 I will set his hand also on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.
089:026 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.
089:027 I also will make him my first-born, The highest of the kings of the earth.
089:028 My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore; And my covenant shall stand fast with him.
089:029 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, And his throne as the days of heaven.
089:030 If his children forsake my law, And walk not in mine ordinances;
089:031 If they break my statutes, And keep not my commandments;
089:032 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes.
089:033 But my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
089:034 My covenant will I not break, Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:
089:036 His seed shall endure for ever, And his throne as the sun before me.
089:037 It shall be established for ever as the moon, And as the faithful witness in the sky. [Selah
089:038 But thou hast cast off and rejected, Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
089:039 Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant: Thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
089:040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
089:041 All that pass by the way rob him: He is become a reproach to his neighbors.
089:042 Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
089:043 Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his sword, And hast not made him to stand in the battle.
089:044 Thou hast made his brightness to cease, And cast his throne down to the ground.
089:045 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: Thou hast covered him with shame. [Selah
089:046 How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? How long shall thy wrath burn like fire?
089:047 Oh remember how short my time is: For what vanity hast thou created all the children of men!
089:048 What man is he that shall live and not see death, That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? [Selah
089:049 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, Which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness?
089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; How I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples,
089:051 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
089:052 Blessed be Jehovah for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
090:001 ¶  Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place In all generations.
090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
090:003 Thou turnest man to destruction, And sayest, Return, ye children of men.
090:004 For a thousand years in thy sight Are but as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.
090:005 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
090:006 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
090:007 For we are consumed in thine anger, And in thy wrath are we troubled.
090:008 Thou hast set our inquities before thee, Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
090:009 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
090:010 The days of our years are threescore years and ten, Or even by reason of strength fourscore years; Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow; For it is soon gone, and we fly away.
090:011 Who knoweth the power of thine anger, And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee?
090:012 So teach us to number our days, That we may get us a heart of wisdom.
090:013 Return, O Jehovah; How long? And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
090:014 Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
090:015 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, And the years wherein we have seen evil.
090:016 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, And thy glory upon their children.
090:017 And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us; And establish thou the work of our hands upon us; Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
091:001 ¶  He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
091:002 I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in whom I trust.
091:003 For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, And from the deadly pestilence.
091:004 He will cover thee with his pinions, And under his wings shalt thou take refuge: His truth is a shield and a buckler.
091:005 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, Nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
091:006 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
091:007 A thousand shall fall at thy side, And ten thousand at thy right hand; But it shall not come nigh thee.
091:008 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, And see the reward of the wicked.
091:009 For thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation;
091:010 There shall no evil befall thee, Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.
091:011 For he will give his angels charge over thee, To keep thee in all thy ways.
091:012 They shall bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
091:013 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot.
091:014 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
091:015 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honor him.
091:016 With long life will I satisfy him, And show him my salvation.
092:001 ¶  It is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah, And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High;
092:002 To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night,
092:003 With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp.
092:004 For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
092:005 How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy thoughts are very deep.
092:006 A brutish man knoweth not; Neither doth a fool understand this:
092:007 When the wicked spring as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they shall be destroyed for ever.
092:008 But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for evermore.
092:009 For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, thine enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
092:010 But my horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil.
092:011 Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies, Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
092:013 They are planted in the house of Jehovah; They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
092:014 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and green:
092:015 To show that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
093:001 ¶  Jehovah reigneth; He is clothed with mjesty; Jehovah is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself therewith: The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.
093:002 Thy throne is established of old: Thou art from everlasting.
093:003 The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves.
093:004 Above the voices of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea, Jehovah on high is mighty.
093:005 Thy testimonies are very sure: Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for evermore.
094:001 ¶  O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.
094:002 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: Render to the proud their desert.
094:003 Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked triumph?
094:004 They prate, they speak arrogantly: All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.
094:005 They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, And afflict thy heritage.
094:006 They slay the widow and the sojourner, And murder the fatherless.
094:007 And they say, Jehovah will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob consider.
094:008 Consider, ye brutish among the people; And ye fools, when will ye be wise?
094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
094:010 He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, Even he that teacheth man knowledge?
094:011 Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man, That they are vanity.
094:012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, And teachest out of thy law;
094:013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit be digged for the wicked.
094:014 For Jehovah will not cast off his people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance.
094:015 For judgment shall return unto righteousness; And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
094:016 Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
094:017 Unless Jehovah had been my help, My soul had soon dwelt in silence.
094:018 When I said, My foot slippeth; Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up.
094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul.
094:020 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, Which frameth mischief by statute?
094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood.
094:022 But Jehovah hath been my high tower, And my God the rock of my refuge.
094:023 And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness; Jehovah our God will cut them off.
095:001 ¶  Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
095:002 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
095:003 For Jehovah is a great God, And a great King above all gods.
095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also.
095:005 The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land.
095:006 Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker:
095:007 For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice!
095:008 Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;
095:009 When your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my work.
095:010 Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known my ways:
095:011 Wherefore I sware in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest.
096:001 ¶  Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song: Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth.
096:002 Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; Show forth his salvation from day to day.
096:003 Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.
096:004 For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He is to be feared above all gods.
096:005 For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.
096:006 Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
096:007 Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.
096:008 Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come into his courts.
096:009 Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: Tremble before him, all the earth.
096:010 Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved: He will judge the peoples with equity.
096:011 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
096:012 Let the field exult, and all that is therein; Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy
096:013 Before Jehovah; For he cometh, For he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with his truth.
097:001 ¶  Jehovah reigneth; Let the earth rejoice; Let the multitude of isles be glad.
097:002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
097:003 A fire goeth before him, And burneth up his adversaries round about.
097:004 His lightnings lightened the world: The earth saw, and trembled.
097:005 The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness, And all the peoples have seen his glory.
097:007 Let all them be put to shame that serve graven images, That boast themselves of idols: Worship him, all ye gods.
097:008 Zion heard and was glad, And the daughters of Judah rejoiced, Because of thy judgments, O Jehovah.
097:009 For thou, Jehovah, art most high above all the earth: Thou art exalted far above all gods.
097:010 O ye that love Jehovah, hate evil: He preserveth the souls of his saints; He delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart.
097:012 Be glad in Jehovah, ye righteous; And give thanks to his holy memorial name.
098:001 ¶  Oh sing unto Jehovah a new song; For he hath done marvellous things: His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him.
098:002 Jehovah hath made known his salvation: His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations.
098:003 He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
098:004 Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all the earth: Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.
098:005 Sing praises unto Jehovah with the harp; With the harp and the voice of melody.
098:006 With trumpets and sound of cornet Make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah.
098:007 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein;
098:008 Let the floods clap their hands; Let the hills sing for joy together
098:009 Before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth: He will judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with equity.
099:001 ¶  Jehovah reigneth; let the peoples tremble: He sitteth above the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
099:002 Jehovah is great in Zion; And he is high above all the peoples.
099:003 Let them praise thy great and terrible name: Holy is he.
099:004 The king’s strength also loveth justice; Thou dost establish equity; Thou executest justice and righteousness in Jacob.
099:005 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his footstool: Holy is he.
099:006 Moses and Aaron among his priests, And Samuel among them that call upon his name; They called upon Jehovah, and he answered them.
099:007 He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: They kept his testimonies, And the statute that he gave them.
099:008 Thou answeredst them, O Jehovah our God: Thou wast a God that forgavest them, Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings.
099:009 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And worship at his holy hill; For Jehovah our God is holy.
100:001 ¶  Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all ye lands.
100:002 Serve Jehovah with gladness: Come before his presence with singing.
100:003 Know ye that Jehovah, he is God: It is he that hath made us, and we are his; We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And into his courts with praise: Give thanks unto him, and bless his name.
100:005 For Jehovah is good; His lovingkindness endureth for ever, And his faithfulness unto all generations.
101:001 ¶  I will sing of lovingkindness and justice: Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I sing praises.
101:002 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
101:003 I will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; It shall not cleave unto me.
101:004 A perverse heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing.
101:005 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy: Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.
101:006 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.
101:007 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.
101:008 Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.
102:001 ¶  Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And let my cry come unto thee.
102:002 Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: Incline thine ear unto me; In the day when I call answer me speedily.
102:003 For my days consume away like smoke, And my bones are burned as a firebrand.
102:004 My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; For I forget to eat my bread.
102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning My bones cleave to my flesh.
102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.
102:007 I watch, and am become like a sparrow That is alone upon the house-top.
102:008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; They that are mad against me do curse by me.
102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping,
102:010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.
102:011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; And I am withered like grass.
102:012 But thou, O Jehovah, wilt abide for ever; And thy memorial name unto all generations.
102:013 Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; For it is time to have pity upon her, Yea, the set time is come.
102:014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, And have pity upon her dust.
102:015 So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory.
102:016 For Jehovah hath built up Zion; He hath appeared in his glory.
102:017 He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, And hath not despised their prayer.
102:018 This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah.
102:019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth;
102:020 To hear the sighing of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death;
102:021 That men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem;
102:022 When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.
102:023 He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.
102:024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: Thy years are throughout all generations.
102:025 Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of thy hands.
102:026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
102:027 But thou art the same, And thy years shall have no end.
102:028 The children of thy servants shall continue, And their seed shall be established before thee.
103:001 ¶  Bless Jehovah, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless his holy name.
103:002 Bless Jehovah, O my soul, And forget not all his benefits:
103:003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases;
103:004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
103:005 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.
103:006 Jehovah executeth righteous acts, And judgments for all that are oppressed.
103:007 He made known his ways unto Moses, His doings unto the chilrren of Israel.
103:008 Jehovah is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.
103:009 He will not always chide; Neither will he keep his anger for ever.
103:010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.
103:011 For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.
103:012 As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
103:013 Like as a father pitieth his children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.
103:014 For he knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.
103:015 As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
103:016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more.
103:017 But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto children’s children;
103:018 To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them.
103:019 Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; And his kingdom ruleth over all.
103:020 Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, Hearkening unto the voice of his word.
103:021 Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
103:022 Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion: Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
104:001 ¶  Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
104:002 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
104:003 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;
104:004 Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers;
104:005 Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever.
104:006 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.
104:007 At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
104:008 (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.
104:009 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth.
104:010 He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains;
104:011 They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst.
104:012 By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches.
104:013 He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
104:014 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth,
104:015 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, And oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man’s heart.
104:016 The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
104:017 Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.
104:018 The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down.
104:020 Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.
104:022 The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens.
104:023 Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening.
104:024 O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches.
104:025 Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts.
104:026 There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.
104:027 These wait all for thee, That thou mayest give them their food in due season.
104:028 Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
104:029 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust.
104:030 Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground.
104:031 Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:
104:032 Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
104:033 I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing priase to my God while I have any being.
104:034 Let thy meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.
104:035 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah.
105:001 ¶  Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known among the peoples his doings.
105:002 Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvelous works.
105:003 Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.
105:004 Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.
105:005 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
105:006 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
105:007 He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth.
105:008 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
105:009 The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,
105:010 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
105:011 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;
105:012 When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.
105:013 And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.
105:014 He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
105:015 Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.
105:016 And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.
105:017 He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:
105:018 His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in chains of iron,
105:019 Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.
105:020 The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
105:021 He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;
105:022 To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.
105:023 Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
105:024 And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.
105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants.
105:026 He sent Moses his servant, And Aaron whom he had chosen.
105:027 They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.
105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words.
105:029 He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.
105:030 Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.
105:031 He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.
105:032 He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land.
105:033 He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.
105:034 He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,
105:035 And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
105:036 He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength.
105:037 And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.
105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.
105:040 They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
105:041 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places like a river.
105:042 For he remembered his holy word, And Abraham his servant.
105:043 And he brought forth his people with joy, And his chosen with singing.
105:044 And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:
105:045 That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.
106:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth forever.
106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?
106:003 Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times.
106:004 Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,
106:005 That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance.
106:006 We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
106:007 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.
106:009 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
106:010 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
106:011 And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.
106:012 Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.
106:013 They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,
106:014 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.
106:015 And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.
106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, And Aaron the saint of Jehovah.
106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.
106:018 And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.
106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.
106:020 Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.
106:021 They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,
106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, And terrible things by the Red Sea.
106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
106:024 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,
106:025 But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
106:026 Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
106:027 And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.
106:028 They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.
106:030 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed.
106:031 And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.
106:032 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
106:033 Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
106:034 They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,
106:035 But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,
106:036 And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them.
106:037 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
106:038 And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.
106:039 Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings.
106:040 Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.
106:041 And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.
106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
106:043 Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.
106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:
106:045 And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
106:046 He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.
106:047 Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.
106:048 Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.
107:001 ¶  O give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
107:002 Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
107:003 And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.
107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.
107:005 Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.
107:006 Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,
107:007 He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.
107:008 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
107:009 For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good.
107:010 Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,
107:011 Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.
107:013 Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.
107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.
107:015 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
107:016 For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.
107:017 Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
107:018 Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.
107:019 Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses.
107:020 He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth them from their destructions.
107:021 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
107:022 And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.
107:023 They that go down to the sea in ships, That do busines in great waters;
107:024 These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep.
107:025 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof.
107:026 They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
107:027 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits’ end.
107:028 Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.
107:029 He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still.
107:030 Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
107:031 Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
107:032 Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.
107:033 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;
107:034 A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
107:035 He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.
107:036 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,
107:037 And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase.
107:038 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
107:039 Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
107:040 He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
107:041 Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh him families like a flock.
107:042 The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
107:043 Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.
108:001 ¶  My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.
108:002 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.
108:003 I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples; And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
108:004 For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And thy truth reacheth unto the skies.
108:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth.
108:006 That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
108:007 God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
108:008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.
108:009 Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe; Over Philistia will I shout.
108:010 Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
108:011 Hast not thou cast us off, O God? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.
108:012 Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.
108:013 Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
109:001 ¶  Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
109:002 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.
109:003 They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause.
109:004 For my love they are my adversaries: But I give myself unto prayer.
109:005 And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love.
109:006 Set thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand.
109:007 When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.
109:008 Let his days be few; And let another take his office.
109:009 Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.
109:010 Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.
109:011 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.
109:012 Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
109:013 Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be rememberd with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
109:015 Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
109:016 Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay them.
109:017 Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.
109:018 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.
109:019 Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
109:020 This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.
109:021 But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name’s sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;
109:022 For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.
109:023 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
109:024 My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness.
109:025 I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head.
109:026 Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:
109:027 That they may know that this is thy hand; That thou, Jehovah, hast done it.
109:028 Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice.
109:029 Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
109:030 I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
109:031 For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.
110:001 ¶  Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, Until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
110:002 Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
110:003 Thy people offer themselves willingly In the day of thy power, in holy array: Out of the womb of the morning Thou hast the dew of thy youth.
110:004 Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.
110:005 The Lord at thy right hand Will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
110:006 He will judge among the nations, He will fill the places with dead bodies; He will strike through the head in many countries.
110:007 He will drink of the brook in the way: Therefore will he lift up the head.
111:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
111:002 The works of Jehovah are great, Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
111:003 His work is honor and majesty; And his righteousness endureth for ever.
111:004 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful.
111:005 He hath given food unto them that fear him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
111:006 He hath showed his people the power of his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations.
111:007 The works of his hands are truth and justice; All his precepts are sure.
111:008 They are established for ever and ever; They are done in truth and uprightness.
111:009 He hath sent redemption unto his people; He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend is his name.
111:010 The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they that do his commandments: His praise endureth for ever.
112:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah. Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, That delighteth greatly in his commandments.
112:002 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: The generation of the upright shall be blessed.
112:003 Wealth and riches are in his house; And his righteousness endureth for ever.
112:004 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
112:005 Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth; He shall maintain his cause in judgment.
112:006 For he shall never be moved; The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
112:007 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.
112:008 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, Until he see his desire upon his adversaries.
112:009 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy; His righteousness endureth for ever: His horn shall be exalted with honor.
112:010 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: The desire of the wicked shall perish.
113:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah, Praise the name of Jehovah.
113:002 Blessed be the name of Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.
113:003 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same Jehovah’s name is to be praised.
113:004 Jehovah is high above all nations, And his glory above the heavens.
113:005 Who is like unto Jehovah our God, That hath his seat on high,
113:006 That humbleth himself to behold The things that are in heaven and in the earth?
113:007 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill;
113:008 That he may set him with princes, Even with the princes of his people.
113:009 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, And to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye Jehovah.
114:001 ¶  When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
114:002 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
114:003 The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan was driven back.
114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.
114:005 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?
114:006 Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; Ye little hills, like lambs?
114:007 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob,
114:008 Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.
115:001 ¶  Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us, But unto thy name give glory, For thy lovingkindness, and for thy truth’s sake.
115:002 Wherefore should the nations say, Where is now their God?
115:003 But our God is in the heavens: He hath done whatsoever he pleased.
115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands.
115:005 They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not;
115:006 They have ears, but they hear not; Noses have they, but they smell not;
115:007 They have hands, but they handle not; Feet have they, but they walk not; Neither speak they through their throat.
115:008 They that make them shall be like unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
115:009 O Israel, trust thou in Jehovah: He is their help and their shield.
115:010 O house of Aaron, trust ye in Jehovah: He is their help and their shield.
115:011 Ye that fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah: He is their help and their shield.
115:012 Jehovah hath been mindful of us; He will bless us: He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.
115:013 He will bless them that fear Jehovah, Both small and great.
115:014 Jehovah increase you more and more, You and your children.
115:015 Blessed are ye of Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.
115:016 The heavens are the heavens of Jehovah; But the earth hath he given to the children of men.
115:017 The dead praise not Jehovah, Neither any that go down into silence;
115:018 But we will bless Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye Jehovah.
116:001 ¶  I love Jehovah, because he heareth My voice and my supplications.
116:002 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
116:003 The cords of death compassed me, And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
116:004 Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
116:005 Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful.
116:006 Jehovah preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me.
116:007 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee.
116:008 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, And my feet from falling.
116:009 I will walk before Jehovah In the land of the living.
116:010 I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted:
116:011 I said in my haste, All men are liars.
116:012 What shall I render unto Jehovah For all his benefits toward me?
116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of Jehovah.
116:014 I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people.
116:015 Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is the death of his saints.
116:016 O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds.
116:017 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of Jehovah.
116:018 I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people,
116:019 In the courts of Jehovah’s house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.
117:001 ¶  O praise Jehovah, all ye nations; Laud him, all ye peoples.
117:002 For his lovingkindness is great toward us; And the truth of Jehovah endureth for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.
118:001 ¶  Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
118:002 Let Israel now say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
118:004 Let them now that fear Jehovah say, That his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
118:005 Out of my distress I called upon Jehovah: Jehovah answered me and set me in a large place.
118:006 Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear: What can man do unto me?
118:007 Jehovah is on my side among them that help me: Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
118:008 It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in man.
118:009 It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to put confidence in princes.
118:010 All nations compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.
118:011 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.
118:012 They compassed me about like bees; They are quenched as the fire of thorns: In the name of Jehovah I will cut them off.
118:013 Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall; But Jehovah helped me.
118:014 Jehovah is my strength and song; And he is become my salvation.
118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly.
118:016 The right hand of Jehovah is exalted: The right hand of Jehovah doeth valiantly.
118:017 I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of Jehovah.
118:018 Jehovah hath chastened me sore; But he hath not given me over unto death.
118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto Jehovah.
118:020 This is the gate of Jehovah; The righteous shall enter into it.
118:021 I will give thanks unto thee; for thou hast answered me, And art become my salvation.
118:022 The stone which the builders rejected Is become the head of the corner.
118:023 This is Jehovah’s doing; It is marvellous in our eyes.
118:024 This is the day which Jehovah hath made; We will rejoice and be glad in it.
118:025 Save now, we beseech thee, O Jehovah: O Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity.
118:026 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah: We have blessed you out of the house of Jehovah.
118:027 Jehovah is God, and he hath given us light: Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.
118:028 Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto thee: Thou art my God, I will exalt thee.
118:029 Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
119:001 ¶  Blessed are they that are perfect in the way, Who walk in the law of Jehovah.
119:002 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, That seek him with the whole heart.
119:003 Yea, they do no unrighteousness; They walk in his ways.
119:004 Thou hast commanded us thy precepts, That we should observe them diligently.
119:005 Oh that my ways were established To observe thy statutes!
119:006 Then shall I not be put to shame, When I have respect unto all thy commandments.
119:007 I will give thanks unto thee with uprightness of heart, When I learn thy righteous judgments.
119:008 I will observe thy statutes: Oh forsake me not utterly.
119:009 Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto according to thy word.
119:010 With my whole heart have I sought thee: Oh let me not wander from thy commandments.
119:011 Thy word have I laid up in my heart, That I might not sin against thee.
119:012 Blessed art thou, O Jehovah: Teach me thy statutes.
119:013 With my lips have I declared All the ordinances of thy mouth.
119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, As much as in all riches.
119:015 I will meditate on thy precepts, And have respect unto thy ways.
119:016 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.
119:017 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live; So will I observe thy word.
119:018 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold Wondrous things out of thy law.
119:019 I am a sojourner in the earth: Hide not thy commandments from me.
119:020 My soul breaketh for the longing That it hath unto thine ordinances at all times.
119:021 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, That do wander from thy commandments.
119:022 Take away from me reproach and contempt; For I have kept thy testimonies.
119:023 Princes also sat and talked against me; But thy servant did meditate on thy statutes.
119:024 Thy testimonies also are my delight And my counsellors.
119:025 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: Quicken thou me according to thy word.
119:026 I declared my ways, and thou answeredst me: Teach me thy statutes.
119:027 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: So shall I meditate on thy wondrous works.
119:028 My soul melteth for heaviness: Strengthen thou me according unto thy word.
119:029 Remove from me the way of falsehood; And grant me thy law graciously.
119:030 I have chosen the way of faithfulness: Thine ordinances have I set before me.
119:031 I cleave unto thy testimonies: O Jehovah, put me not to shame.
119:032 I will run the way of thy commandments, When thou shalt enlarge my heart.
119:033 Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of thy statutes; And I shall keep it unto the end.
119:034 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.
119:035 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; For therein do I delight.
119:036 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, And not to covetousness.
119:037 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, And quicken me in thy ways.
119:038 Confirm unto thy servant thy word, Which is in order unto the fear of thee.
119:039 Turn away my reproach whereof I am afraid; For thine ordinances are good.
119:040 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: Quicken me in thy righteousness.
119:041 Let thy lovingkindnesses also come unto me, O Jehovah, Even thy salvation, according to thy word.
119:042 So shall I have an answer for him that reproacheth me; For I trust in thy word.
119:043 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; For I have hoped in thine ordinances.
119:044 So shall I observe thy law continually For ever and ever.
119:045 And I shall walk at liberty; For I have sought thy precepts.
119:046 I will also speak of thy testimonies before kings, And shall not be put to shame.
119:047 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, Which I have loved.
119:048 I will lift up my hands also unto thy commandments, which I have loved; And I will meditate on thy statutes.
119:049 Remember the word unto thy servant, Because thou hast made me to hope.
119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction; For thy word hath quickened me.
119:051 The proud have had me greatly in derision: Yet have I not swerved from thy law.
119:052 I have remembered thine ordinances of old, O Jehovah, And have comforted myself.
119:053 Hot indignation hath taken hold upon me, Because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
119:054 Thy statutes have been my songs In the house of my pilgrimage.
119:055 I have remembered thy name, O Jehovah, in the night, And have observed thy law.
119:056 This I have had, Because I have kept thy precepts.
119:057 Jehovah is my portion: I have said that I would observe thy words.
119:058 I entreated thy favor with my whole heart: Be merciful unto me according to thy word.
119:059 I thought on my ways, And turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
119:060 I made haste, and delayed not, To observe thy commandments.
119:061 The cords of the wicked have wrapped me round; But I have not forgotten thy law.
119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee Because of thy righteous ordinances.
119:063 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, And of them that observe thy precepts.
119:064 The earth, O Jehovah, is full of thy lovingkindness: Teach me thy statutes.
119:065 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O Jehovah, according unto thy word.
119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge; For I have believed in thy commandments.
119:067 Before I was afflicted I went astray; But now I observe thy word.
119:068 Thou art good, and doest good; Teach me thy statutes.
119:069 The proud have forged a lie against me: With my whole heart will I keep thy precepts.
119:070 Their heart is as fat as grease; But I delight in thy law.
119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; That I may learn thy statutes.
119:072 The law of thy mouth is better unto me Than thousands of gold and silver.
119:073 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.
119:074 They that fear thee shall see me and be glad, Because I have hoped in thy word.
119:075 I know, O Jehovah, that thy judgments are righteous, And that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.
119:076 Let, I pray thee, thy lovingkindness be for my comfort, According to thy word unto thy servant.
119:077 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live; For thy law is my delight.
119:078 Let the proud be put to shame; For they have overthrown me wrongfully: But I will meditate on thy precepts.
119:079 Let those that fear thee turn unto me; And they shall know thy testimonies.
119:080 Let my heart be perfect in thy statutes, That I be not put to shame.
119:081 My soul fainteth for thy salvation; But I hope in thy word.
119:082 Mine eyes fail for thy word, While I say, When wilt thou comfort me?
119:083 For I am become like a wine-skin in the smoke; Yet do I not forget thy statutes.
119:084 How many are the days of thy servant? When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
119:085 The proud have digged pits for me, Who are not according to thy law.
119:086 All thy commandments are faithful: They persecute me wrongfully; Help thou me.
119:087 They had almost consumed me upon earth; But I forsook not thy precepts.
119:088 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; So shall I observe the testimony of thy mouth.
119:089 For ever, O Jehovah, Thy word is settled in heaven.
119:090 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
119:091 They abide this day according to thine ordinances; For all things are thy servants.
119:092 Unless thy law had been my delight, I should then have perished in mine affliction.
119:093 I will never forget thy precepts; For with them thou hast quickened me.
119:094 I am thine, save me; For I have sought thy precepts.
119:095 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me; But I will consider thy testimonies.
119:096 I have seen an end of all perfection; But thy commandment is exceeding broad.
119:097 Oh how love I thy law! It is my meditation all the day.
119:098 Thy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies; For they are ever with me.
119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers; For thy testimonies are my meditation.
119:100 I understand more than the aged, Because I have kept thy precepts.
119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, That I might observe thy word.
119:102 I have not turned aside from thine ordinances; For thou hast taught me.
119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: Therefore I hate every false way.
119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, And light unto my path.
119:106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it, That I will observe thy righteous ordinances.
119:107 I am afflicted very much: Quicken me, O Jehovah, according unto thy word.
119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill-offerings of my mouth, O Jehovah, And teach me thine ordinances.
119:109 My soul is continually in my hand; Yet do I not forget thy law.
119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me; Yet have I not gone astray from thy precepts.
119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever; For they are the rejoicing of my heart.
119:112 I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes For ever, even unto the end.
119:113 I hate them that are of a double mind; But thy law do I love.
119:114 Thou art my hiding-place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
119:115 Depart from me, ye evil-doers, That I may keep the commandments of my God.
119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live; And let me not be ashamed of my hope.
119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe, And shall have respect unto thy statutes continually.
119:118 Thou hast set at nought all them that err from thy statutes; For their deceit is falsehood.
119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: Therefore I love thy testimonies.
119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; And I am afraid of thy judgments.
119:121 I have done justice and righteousness: Leave me not to mine oppressors.
119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: Let not the proud oppress me.
119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, And for thy righteous word.
119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy lovingkindness, And teach me thy statutes.
119:125 I am thy servant; Give me understanding, That I may know thy testimonies.
119:126 It is time for Jehovah to work; For they have made void thy law.
119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments Above gold, yea, above fine gold.
119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; And I hate every false way.
119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful; Therefore doth my soul keep them.
119:130 The opening of thy words giveth light; It giveth understanding unto the simple.
119:131 I opened wide my mouth, and panted; For I longed for thy commandments.
119:132 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me, As thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.
119:133 Establish my footsteps in thy word; And let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
119:134 Redeem me from the oppression of man: So will I observe thy precepts.
119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; And teach me thy statutes.
119:136 Streams of water run down mine eyes, Because they observe not thy law.
119:137 Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, And upright are thy judgments.
119:138 Thou hast commanded thy testimonies in righteousness And very faithfulness.
119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, Because mine adversaries have forgotten thy words.
119:140 Thy word is very pure; Therefore thy servant loveth it.
119:141 I am small and despised; Yet do I not forget thy precepts.
119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, And thy law is truth.
119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me; Yet thy commandments are my delight.
119:144 Thy testimonies are righteous for ever: Give me understanding, and I shall live.
119:145 I have called with my whole heart; Answer me, O Jehovah: I will keep thy statutes.
119:146 I have called unto thee; Save me, And I shall observe thy testimonies.
119:147 I anticipated the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy words.
119:148 Mine eyes anticipated the night-watches, That I might meditate on thy word.
119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to thine ordinances.
119:150 They draw nigh that follow after wickedness; They are far from thy law.
119:151 Thou art nigh, O Jehovah; And all thy commandments are truth.
119:152 Of old have I known from thy testimonies, That thou hast founded them for ever.
119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me; For I do not forget thy law.
119:154 Plead thou my cause, and redeem me: Quicken me according to thy word.
119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked; For they seek not thy statutes.
119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O Jehovah: Quicken me acording to thine ordinances.
119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine adversaries; Yet have I not swerved from thy testimonies.
119:158 I beheld the treacherous, and was grieved, Because they observe not thy word.
119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to thy lovingkindness.
119:160 The sum of thy word is truth; And every one of thy righteous ordinances endureth for ever.
119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause; But my heart standeth in awe of thy words.
119:162 I rejoice at thy word, As one that findeth great spoil.
119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood; But thy law do I love.
119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee, Because of thy righteous ordinances.
119:165 Great peace have they that love thy law; And they have no occasion of stumbling.
119:166 I have hoped for thy salvation, O Jehovah, And have done thy commandments.
119:167 My soul hath observed thy testimonies; And I love them exceedingly.
119:168 I have observed thy precepts and thy testimonies; For all my ways are before thee.
119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O Jehovah: Give me understanding according to thy word.
119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: Deliver me according to thy word.
119:171 Let my lips utter praise; For thou teachest me thy statutes.
119:172 Let my tongue sing of thy word; For all thy commandments are righteousness.
119:173 Let thy hand be ready to help me; For I have chosen thy precepts.
119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O Jehovah; And thy law is my delight.
119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; And let thine ordinances help me.
119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; Seek thy servant; For I do not forget thy commandments.
120:001 ¶  In my distress I cried unto Jehovah, And he answered me.
120:002 Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips, And from a deceitful tongue.
120:003 What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue?
120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals of juniper.
120:005 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
120:006 My soul hath long had her dwelling With him that hateth peace.
120:007 I am for peace: But when I speak, they are for war.
121:001 ¶  I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come?
121:002 My help cometh from Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.
121:003 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
121:004 Behold, he that keepeth Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep.
121:005 Jehovah is thy keeper: Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand.
121:006 The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night.
121:007 Jehovah will keep thee from all evil; He will keep thy soul.
121:008 Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in From this time forth and for evermore.
122:001 ¶  I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of Jehovah.
122:002 Our feet are standing Within thy gates, O Jerusalem,
122:003 Jerusalem, that art builded As a city that is compact together;
122:004 Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of Jehovah, For an ordinance for Israel, To give thanks unto the name of Jehovah.
122:005 For there are set thrones for judgment, The thrones of the house of David.
122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They shall prosper that love thee.
122:007 Peace be within thy walls, And prosperity within thy palaces.
122:008 For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
122:009 For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good.
123:001 ¶  Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes, O thou that sittest in the heavens.
123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress; So our eyes look unto Jehovah our God, Until he have mercy upon us.
123:003 Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us; For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scoffing of those that are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.
124:001 ¶  If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, Let Israel now say,
124:002 If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, When men rose up against us;
124:003 Then they had swallowed us up alive, When their wrath was kindled against us;
124:004 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, The stream had gone over our soul;
124:005 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
124:006 Blessed be Jehovah, Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
124:007 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: The snare is broken, and we are escaped.
124:008 Our help is in the name of Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.
125:001 ¶  They that trust in Jehovah Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.
125:002 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, So Jehovah is round about his people From this time forth and for evermore.
125:003 For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.
125:004 Do good, O Jehovah, unto those that are good, And to them that are upright in their hearts.
125:005 But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.
126:001 ¶  When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream.
126:002 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them.
126:003 Jehovah hath done great things for us, Whereof we are glad.
126:004 Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, As the streams in the South.
126:005 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
126:006 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
127:001 ¶  Except Jehovah build the house, They labor in vain that build it: Except Jehovah keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain.
127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, To take rest late, To eat the bread of toil; For so he giveth unto his beloved sleep.
127:003 Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah; And the fruit of the womb is his reward.
127:004 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of youth.
127:005 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
128:001 ¶  Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, That walketh in his ways.
128:002 For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
128:003 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, In the innermost parts of thy house; Thy children like olive plants, Round about thy table.
128:004 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed That feareth Jehovah.
128:005 Jehovah bless thee out of Zion: And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
128:006 Yea, see thou thy children’s children. Peace be upon Israel.
129:001 ¶  Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, Let Israel now say,
129:002 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: Yet they have not prevailed against me.
129:003 The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows.
129:004 Jehovah is righteous: He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
129:005 Let them be put to shame and turned backward, All they that hate Zion.
129:006 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth before it groweth up;
129:007 Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
129:008 Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah.
130:001 ¶  Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Jehovah.
130:002 Lord, hear my voice: Let thine ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.
130:003 If thou, Jehovah, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
130:004 But there is forgiveness with thee, That thou mayest be feared.
130:005 I wait for Jehovah, my soul doth wait, And in his word do I hope.
130:006 My soul waiteth for the Lord More than watchmen wait for the morning; Yea, more than watchmen for the morning.
130:007 O Israel, hope in Jehovah; For with Jehovah there is lovingkindness, And with him is plenteous redemption.
130:008 And he will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
131:001 ¶  Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; Neither do I exercise myself in great matters, Or in things too wonderful for me.
131:002 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child with his mother, Like a weaned child is my soul within me.
131:003 O Israel, hope in Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.
132:001 ¶  Jehovah, remember for David All his affliction;
132:002 How he sware unto Jehovah, And vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:
132:003 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, Nor go up into my bed;
132:004 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, Or slumber to mine eyelids;
132:005 Until I find out a place for Jehovah, A tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob.
132:006 Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah: We found it in the field of the wood.
132:007 We will go into his tabernacles; We will worship at his footstool.
132:008 Arise, O Jehovah, into thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of thy strength.
132:009 Let thy priest be clothed with righteousness; And let thy saints shout for joy.
132:010 For thy servant David’s sake Turn not away the face of thine anointed.
132:011 Jehovah hath sworn unto David in truth; He will not turn from it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
132:012 If thy children will keep my covenant And my testimony that I shall teach them, Their children also shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.
132:013 For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for his habitation.
132:014 This is my resting-place for ever: Here will I dwell; For I have desired it.
132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
132:016 Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
132:017 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
132:018 His enemies will I clothe with shame; But upon himself shall his crown flourish.
133:001 ¶  Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity!
133:002 It is like the precious oil upon the head, That ran down upon the beard, Even Aaron’s beard; That came down upon the skirt of his garments;
133:003 Like the dew of Hermon, That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion: For there Jehovah commanded the blessing, Even life for evermore.
134:001 ¶  Behold, bless ye Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah, That by night stand in the house of Jehovah.
134:002 Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, And bless ye Jehovah.
134:003 Jehovah bless thee out of Zion; Even he that made heaven and earth.
135:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye the name of Jehovah; Praise him, O ye servants of Jehovah,
135:002 Ye that stand in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.
135:003 Praise ye Jehovah; For Jehovah is good: Sing praises unto his name; For it is pleasant.
135:004 For Jehovah hath chosen Jacob unto himself, And Israel for his own possession.
135:005 For I know that Jehovah is great, And that our Lord is above all gods.
135:006 Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, that hath he done, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
135:007 Who causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; Who maketh lightnings for the rain; Who bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries;
135:008 Who smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast;
135:009 Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants;
135:010 Who smote many nations, And slew mighty kings,
135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, And Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan,
135:012 And gave their land for a heritage, A heritage unto Israel his people.
135:013 Thy name, O Jehovah, endureth for ever; Thy memorial name, O Jehovah, throughout all generations.
135:014 For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself concerning his servants.
135:015 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men’s hands.
135:016 They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not;
135:017 They have ears, but they hear not; Neither is there any breath in their mouths.
135:018 They that make them shall be like unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
135:019 O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah: O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah:
135:020 O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah: Ye that fear Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.
135:021 Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, Who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.
136:001 ¶  Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
136:002 Oh give thanks unto the God of gods; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
136:003 Oh give thanks unto the Lord of lords; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:004 To him who alone doeth great wonders; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:005 To him that by understanding made the heavens; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:006 To him that spread forth the earth above the waters; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:007 To him that made great lights; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:008 The sun to rule by day; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:010 To him that smote Egypt in their first-born; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:011 And brought out Israel from among them; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:012 With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:013 To him that divided the Red Sea in sunder; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:016 To him that led his people through the wilderness; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:017 To him that smote great kings; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:018 And slew famous kings; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites; For his lovingkindness endureth forever;
136:020 And Og king of Bashan; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:021 And gave their land for a heritage; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:022 Even a heritage unto Israel his servant; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
136:024 And hath delivered us from our adversaries; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever:
136:025 Who giveth food to all flesh; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
136:026 Oh give thanks unto the God of heaven; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
137:001 ¶  By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion.
137:002 Upon the willows in the midst thereof We hanged up our harps.
137:003 For there they that led us captive required of us songs, And they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
137:004 How shall we sing Jehovah’s song In a foreign land?
137:005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget her skill.
137:006 Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I remember thee not; If I prefer not Jerusalem Above my chief joy.
137:007 Remember, O Jehovah, against the children of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said, Rase it, rase it, Even to the foundation thereof.
137:008 O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed, Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee As thou hast served us.
137:009 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones Against the rock.
138:001 ¶  I will give thee thanks with my whole heart: Before the gods will I sing praises unto thee.
138:002 I will worship toward thy holy temple, And give thanks unto thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: For thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
138:003 In the day that I called thou answeredst me, Thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul.
138:004 All the kings of the earth shall give thee thanks, O Jehovah, For they have heard the words of thy mouth.
138:005 Yea, they shall sing of the ways of Jehovah; For great is the glory of Jehovah.
138:006 For though Jehovah is high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly; But the haughty he knoweth from afar.
138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me; Thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies, And thy right hand will save me.
138:008 Jehovah will perfect that which concerneth me: Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, endureth for ever; Forsake not the works of thine own hands.
139:001 ¶  O Jehovah, thou hast searched me, and known me.
139:002 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising; Thou understandest my thought afar off.
139:003 Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, And art acquainted with all my ways.
139:004 For there is not a word in my tongue, But, lo, O Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether.
139:005 Thou hast beset me behind and before, And laid thy hand upon me.
139:006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain unto it.
139:007 Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.
139:009 If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
139:010 Even there shall thy hand lead me, And thy right hand shall hold me.
139:011 If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me, And the light about me shall be night;
139:012 Even the darkness hideth not from thee, But the night shineth as the day: The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
139:013 For thou didst form my inward parts: Thou didst cover me in my mother’s womb.
139:014 I will give thanks unto thee; For I am fearfully and wonderfully made: Wonderful are thy works; And that my soul knoweth right well.
139:015 My frame was not hidden from thee, When I was made in secret, And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
139:016 Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance; And in thy book they were all written, Even the days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was none of them.
139:017 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!
139:018 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: When I awake, I am still with thee.
139:019 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.
139:020 For they speak against thee wickedly, And thine enemies take thy name in vain.
139:021 Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee? And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred: They are become mine enemies.
139:023 Search me, O God, and know my heart: Try me, and know my thoughts;
139:024 And see if there be any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.
140:001 ¶  Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man; Preserve me from the violent man:
140:002 Who devise mischiefs in their heart; Continually do they gather themselves together for war.
140:003 They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; Adders’ poison is under their lips. [Selah
140:004 Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.
140:005 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set gins for me. [Selah
140:006 I said unto Jehovah, Thou art my God: Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.
140:007 O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
140:008 Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked; Further not his evil device, lest they exalt themselves. [Selah
140:009 As for the head of those that compass me about, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
140:010 Let burning coals fall upon them: Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, whence they shall not rise.
140:011 An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth: Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
140:012 I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And justice for the needy.
140:013 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: The upright shall dwell in thy presence.
141:001 ¶  Jehovah, I have called upon thee; Make haste unto me: Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.
141:002 Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
141:003 Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips.
141:004 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, To practise deeds of wickedness With men that work iniquity: And let me not eat of their dainties.
141:005 Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; And let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; Let not my head refuse it: For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.
141:006 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; And they shall hear my words; For they are sweet.
141:007 As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
141:008 For mine eyes are unto thee, O Jehovah the Lord: In thee do I take refuge; Leave not my soul destitute.
141:009 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.
141:010 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, Whilst that I withal escape.
142:001 ¶  I cry with my voice unto Jehovah; With my voice unto Jehovah do I make supplication.
142:002 I pour out my complaint before him; I show before him my trouble.
142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a snare for me.
142:004 Look on my right hand, and see; For there is no man that knoweth me: Refuge hath failed me; No man careth for my soul.
142:005 I cried unto thee, O Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.
142:006 Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I.
142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks unto thy name: The righteous shall compass me about; For thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
143:001 ¶  Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; Give ear to my supplications: In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
143:002 And enter not into judgment with thy servant; For in thy sight no man living is righteous.
143:003 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; He hath smitten my life down to the ground: He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
143:004 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is desolate.
143:005 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy doings; I muse on the work of thy hands.
143:006 I spread forth my hands unto thee: My soul thirsteth after thee, as a weary land. [Selah
143:007 Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah; My spirit faileth: Hide not thy face from me, Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.
143:008 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; For in thee do I trust: Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; For I lift up my soul unto thee.
143:009 Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
143:010 Teach me to do thy will; For thou art my God: Thy Spirit is good; Lead me in the land of uprightness.
143:011 Quicken me, O Jehovah, for thy name’s sake: In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
143:012 And in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies, And destroy all them that afflict my soul; For I am thy servant.
144:001 ¶  Blessed be Jehovah my rock, Who teacheth my hands to war, And my fingers to fight:
144:002 My lovingkindness, and my fortress, My high tower, and my deliverer; My shield, and he in whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me.
144:003 Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
144:004 Man is like to vanity: His days are as a shadow that passeth away.
144:005 Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down: Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
144:006 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.
144:007 Stretch forth thy hand from above; Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens;
144:008 Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
144:009 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
144:010 Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings; Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
144:011 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
144:012 When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth, And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;
144:013 When our garners are full, affording all manner of store, And our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
144:014 When our oxen are well laden; When there is no breaking in, and no going forth, And no outcry in our streets:
144:015 Happy is the people that is in such a case; Yea, happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.
145:001 ¶  I will extol thee, my God, O King; And I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
145:002 Every day will I bless thee; And I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
145:003 Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised; And his greatness is unsearchable.
145:004 One generation shall laud thy works to another, And shall declare thy mighty acts.
145:005 Of the glorious majesty of thine honor, And of thy wondrous works, will I meditate.
145:006 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts; And I will declare thy greatness.
145:007 They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness, And shall sing of thy righteousness.
145:008 Jehovah is gracious, and merciful; Slow to anger, and of great lovingkindness.
145:009 Jehovah is good to all; And his tender mercies are over all his works.
145:010 All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah; And thy saints shall bless thee.
145:011 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, And talk of thy power;
145:012 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
145:013 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
145:014 Jehovah upholdeth all that fall, And raiseth up all those that are bowed down.
145:015 The eyes of all wait for thee; And thou givest them their food in due season.
145:016 Thou openest thy hand, And satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
145:017 Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, And gracious in all his works.
145:018 Jehovah is nigh unto all them that call upon him, To all that call upon him in truth.
145:019 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; He also will hear their cry and will save them.
145:020 Jehovah preserveth all them that love him; But all the wicked will he destroy.
145:021 My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah; And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
146:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul.
146:002 While I live will I praise Jehovah: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
146:003 Put not your trust in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
146:004 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; In that very day his thoughts perish.
146:005 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in Jehovah his God:
146:006 Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever;
146:007 Who executeth justice for the oppressed; Who giveth food to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners;
146:008 Jehovah openeth the eyes of the blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous;
146:009 Jehovah preserveth the sojourners; He upholdeth the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
146:010 Jehovah will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye Jehovah.
147:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah; For it is good to sing praises unto our God; For it is pleasant, and praise is comely.
147:002 Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem; He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.
147:003 He healeth the broken in heart, And bindeth up their wounds.
147:004 He counteth the number of the stars; He calleth them all by their names.
147:005 Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite.
147:006 Jehovah upholdeth the meek: He bringeth the wicked down to the ground.
147:007 Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; Sing praises upon the harp unto our God,
147:008 Who covereth the heavens with clouds, Who prepareth rain for the earth, Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
147:009 He giveth to the beast his food, And to the young ravens which cry.
147:010 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man.
147:011 Jehovah taketh pleasure in them that fear him, In those that hope in his lovingkindness.
147:012 Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem; Praise thy God, O Zion.
147:013 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee.
147:014 He maketh peace in thy borders; He filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
147:015 He sendeth out his commandment upon earth; His word runneth very swiftly.
147:016 He giveth snow like wool; He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
147:017 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: Who can stand before his cold?
147:018 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
147:019 He showeth his word unto Jacob, His statutes and his ordinances unto Israel.
147:020 He hath not dealt so with any nation; And as for his ordinances, they have not known them. Praise ye Jehovah.
148:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens: Praise him in the heights.
148:002 Praise ye him, all his angels: Praise ye him, all his host.
148:003 Praise ye him, sun and moon: Praise him, all ye stars of light.
148:004 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens.
148:005 Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For he commanded, and they were created.
148:006 He hath also established them for ever and ever: He hath made a decree which shall not pass away.
148:007 Praise Jehovah from the earth, Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps.
148:008 Fire and hail, snow and vapor; Stormy wind, fulfilling his word;
148:009 Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees and all cedars;
148:010 Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and flying birds;
148:011 Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth;
148:012 Both young men and virgins; Old men and children:
148:013 Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For his name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
148:014 And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, The praise of all his saints; Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye Jehovah.
149:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints.
149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp.
149:004 For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation.
149:005 Let the saints exult in glory: Let them sing for joy upon their beds.
149:006 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand;
149:007 To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishments upon the peoples;
149:008 To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;
149:009 To execute upon them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah.
150:001 ¶  Praise ye Jehovah. Praise God in his sanctuary: Praise him in the firmament of his power.
150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts: Praise him according to his excellent greatness.
150:003 Praise him with trumpet sound: Praise him with psaltery and harp.
150:004 Praise him with timbrel and dance: Praise him with stringed instruments and pipe.
150:005 Praise him with loud cymbals: Praise him with high sounding cymbals.
150:006 Let everything that hath breath praise Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah.
