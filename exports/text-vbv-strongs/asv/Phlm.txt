001:001 ¶  Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
001:002 and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:
001:003 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
001:004 I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,
001:005 hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
001:006 that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.
001:007 For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
001:008 Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,
001:009 yet for love’s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:
001:010 I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,
001:011 who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:
001:012 whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:
001:013 whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
001:014 but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.
001:015 For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;
001:016 no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
001:017 If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.
001:018 But if he hath wronged the at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account;
001:019 I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.
001:020 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.
001:021 Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.
001:022 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.
001:023 Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;
001:024 and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.
001:025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
