001:001 ¶  How the city sits solitary,␤ that was full of people!␤ She has become as a widow,␤ who was great among the nations!␤ She who was a princess among the provinces ␤ has become a slave!
001:002 ¶  She weeps bitterly in the night.␤ Her tears are on her cheeks.␤ Among all her lovers ␤ she has no one to comfort her.␤ All her friends have dealt treacherously with her.␤ They have become her enemies.
001:003 ¶  Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction ␤ and because of great servitude.␤ She dwells among the nations.␤ She finds no rest.␤ All her persecutors overtook her in her distress.
001:004 ¶  The roads to Zion mourn,␤ because no one comes to the solemn assembly.␤ All her gates are desolate.␤ Her priests sigh.␤ Her virgins are afflicted,␤ and she herself is in bitterness.
001:005 ¶  Her adversaries have become the head.␤ Her enemies prosper;␤ for Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions.␤ Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary.° {“Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.}
001:006 ¶  All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion.␤ Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture.␤ They have gone without strength before the pursuer.
001:007 ¶  Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries ␤ all her pleasant things that were from the days of old;␤ when her people fell into the hand of the adversary,␤ and no one helped her.␤ The adversaries saw her.␤ They mocked at her desolations.
001:008 ¶  Jerusalem has grievously sinned.␤ Therefore she has become unclean.␤ All who honored her despise her,␤ because they have seen her nakedness.␤ Yes, she sighs and turns backward.
001:009 ¶  Her filthiness was in her skirts.␤ She didn’t remember her latter end.␤ Therefore she has come down astoundingly.␤ She has no comforter.␤ “See, Yahweh, my affliction;␤ for the enemy has magnified himself.”

001:011 ¶  All her people sigh.␤ They seek bread.␤ They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh their soul.␤ “Look, Yahweh, and see,␤ for I have become despised.”
001:012 ¶  “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?␤ Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,␤ which is brought on me,␤ with which Yahweh has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.

001:014 ¶  “The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand.␤ They are knit together.␤ They have come up on my neck.␤ He made my strength fail.␤ The Lord has delivered me into their hands,␤ against whom I am not able to stand.° {The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”}
001:015 ¶  “The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men within me.␤ He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men.␤ The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a wine press.
001:016 ¶  “For these things I weep.␤ My eye, my eye runs down with water,␤ because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me.␤ My children are desolate,␤ because the enemy has prevailed.”

002:001 ¶  How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!␤ He has cast the beauty of Israel down from heaven to the earth,␤ and hasn’t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
002:002 ¶  The Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob ␤ without pity.␤ He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah.␤ He has brought them down to the ground.␤ He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.
002:003 ¶  He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger.␤ He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy.␤ He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire,␤ which devours all around.

002:006 ¶  He has violently taken away his tabernacle,␤ as if it were a garden.␤ He has destroyed his place of assembly.␤ Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion.␤ In the indignation of his anger, he has despised the king and the priest.
002:007 ¶  The Lord has cast off his altar.␤ He has abhorred his sanctuary.␤ He has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy.␤ They have made a noise in Yahweh’s house,␤ as in the day of a solemn assembly.
002:008 ¶  Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion.␤ He has stretched out the line.␤ He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying;␤ He has made the rampart and wall lament.␤ They languish together.
002:009 ¶  Her gates have sunk into the ground.␤ He has destroyed and broken her bars.␤ Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not.␤ Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.
002:010 ¶  The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground.␤ They keep silence.␤ They have cast up dust on their heads.␤ They have clothed themselves with sackcloth.␤ The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
002:011 ¶  My eyes fail with tears.␤ My heart is troubled.␤ My bile is poured on the earth,␤ because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,␤ because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.
002:012 ¶  They ask their mothers,␤ “Where is grain and wine?” ␤ when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,␤ when their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.
002:013 ¶  What shall I testify to you?␤ What shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem?␤ What shall I compare to you,␤ that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion?␤ For your breach is as big as the sea.␤ Who can heal you?
002:014 ¶  Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you.␤ They have not uncovered your iniquity,␤ to reverse your captivity,␤ but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment.
002:015 ¶  All that pass by clap their hands at you.␤ They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,␤ “Is this the city that men called ‘The perfection of beauty,␤ the joy of the whole earth’?”
002:016 ¶  All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you.␤ They hiss and gnash their teeth.␤ They say, “We have swallowed her up.␤ Certainly this is the day that we looked for.␤ We have found it.␤ We have seen it.”
002:017 ¶  Yahweh has done that which he planned.␤ He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old.␤ He has thrown down,␤ and has not pitied.␤ He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you.␤ He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.
002:018 ¶  Their heart cried to the Lord.␤ O wall of the daughter of Zion,␤ let tears run down like a river day and night.␤ Give yourself no relief.␤ Don’t let your eyes rest.
002:019 ¶  Arise, cry out in the night,␤ at the beginning of the watches!␤ Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord.␤ Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children,␤ who faint for hunger at the head of every street.
002:020 ¶  “Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus!␤ Should the women eat their offspring,␤ the children that they held and bounced on their knees?␤ Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
002:021 ¶  “The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets.␤ My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword.␤ You have killed them in the day of your anger.␤ You have slaughtered, and not pitied.
002:022 ¶  “You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side.␤ There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh’s anger.␤ My enemy has consumed those whom I have cared for and brought up.
003:001 ¶  I am the man who has seen affliction ␤ by the rod of his wrath.␤
003:002 He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness,␤ and not in light.␤
003:003 Surely he turns his hand against me ␤ again and again all day long.
003:004 ¶  He has made my flesh and my skin old.␤ He has broken my bones.␤
003:005 He has built against me,␤ and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.␤
003:006 He has made me dwell in dark places,␤ as those who have been long dead.
003:007 ¶  He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out.␤ He has made my chain heavy.␤
003:008 Yes, when I cry, and call for help,␤ he shuts out my prayer.␤
003:009 He has walled up my ways with cut stone.␤ He has made my paths crooked.
003:010 ¶  He is to me as a bear lying in wait,␤ as a lion in hiding.␤
003:011 He has turned away my path,␤ and pulled me in pieces.␤ He has made me desolate.␤
003:012 He has bent his bow,␤ and set me as a mark for the arrow.
003:013 ¶  He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.␤
003:014 I have become a derision to all my people,␤ and their song all day long.␤
003:015 He has filled me with bitterness.␤ He has stuffed me with wormwood.
003:016 ¶  He has also broken my teeth with gravel.␤ He has covered me with ashes.␤
003:017 You have removed my soul far away from peace.␤ I forgot prosperity.␤
003:018 I said, “My strength has perished,␤ along with my expectation from Yahweh.”
003:019 ¶  Remember my affliction and my misery,␤ the wormwood and the bitterness.␤
003:020 My soul still remembers them,␤ and is bowed down within me.␤
003:021 This I recall to my mind;␤ therefore I have hope.
003:022 ¶  It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed,␤ because his mercies don’t fail.␤
003:023 They are new every morning.␤ Great is your faithfulness.␤
003:024 “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul.␤ “Therefore I will hope in him.”
003:025 ¶  Yahweh is good to those who wait for him,␤ to the soul who seeks him.␤
003:026 It is good that a man should hope ␤ and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.␤
003:027 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
003:028 ¶  Let him sit alone and keep silence,␤ because he has laid it on him.␤
003:029 Let him put his mouth in the dust,␤ if it is so that there may be hope.␤
003:030 Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him.␤ Let him be filled full of reproach.
003:031 ¶  For the Lord will not cast off forever.␤
003:032 For though he causes grief,␤ yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.␤
003:033 For he does not afflict willingly,␤ nor grieve the children of men.
003:034 ¶  To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,␤
003:035 to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High,␤
003:036 to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve.
003:037 ¶  Who is he who says, and it comes to pass,␤ when the Lord doesn’t command it?␤
003:038 Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?␤
003:039 Why should a living man complain,␤ a man for the punishment of his sins?
003:040 ¶  Let us search and try our ways,␤ and turn again to Yahweh.␤
003:041 Let’s lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.␤° {The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “[hebrew]אֱלֹהִ֑ים[/hebrew]” (Elohim).}
003:042 “We have transgressed and have rebelled.␤ You have not pardoned.
003:043 ¶  “You have covered us with anger and pursued us.␤ You have killed.␤ You have not pitied.␤
003:044 You have covered yourself with a cloud,␤ so that no prayer can pass through.␤
003:045 You have made us an off-scouring and refuse ␤ in the middle of the peoples.
003:046 ¶  “All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.␤
003:047 Terror and the pit have come on us,␤ devastation and destruction.”
003:048 ¶  My eye runs down with streams of water,␤ for the destruction of the daughter of my people.␤
003:049 My eye pours down ␤ and doesn’t cease,␤ without any intermission,␤
003:050 until Yahweh looks down,␤ and sees from heaven.␤
003:051 My eye affects my soul,␤ because of all the daughters of my city.
003:052 ¶  They have chased me relentlessly like a bird,␤ those who are my enemies without cause.␤
003:053 They have cut off my life in the dungeon,␤ and have cast a stone on me.␤
003:054 Waters flowed over my head.␤ I said, “I am cut off.”
003:055 ¶  I called on your name, Yahweh,␤ out of the lowest dungeon.␤
003:056 You heard my voice:␤ “Don’t hide your ear from my sighing,␤ and my cry.”
003:057 ¶  You came near in the day that I called on you.␤ You said, “Don’t be afraid.”
003:058 ¶  Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul.␤ You have redeemed my life.␤
003:059 Yahweh, you have seen my wrong.␤ Judge my cause.␤
003:060 You have seen all their vengeance ␤ and all their plans against me.
003:061 ¶  You have heard their reproach, Yahweh,␤ and all their plans against me,␤
003:062 the lips of those that rose up against me,␤ and their plots against me all day long.␤
003:063 You see their sitting down and their rising up.␤ I am their song.
003:064 ¶  You will pay them back, Yahweh,␤ according to the work of their hands.␤
003:065 You will give them hardness of heart,␤ your curse to them.␤
003:066 You will pursue them in anger,␤ and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.
004:001 ¶  How the gold has become dim!␤ The most pure gold has changed!␤ The stones of the sanctuary are poured out ␤ at the head of every street.
004:002 ¶  The precious sons of Zion,␤ comparable to fine gold,␤ how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers,␤ the work of the hands of the potter!
004:003 ¶  Even the jackals offer their breast.␤ They nurse their young ones.␤ But the daughter of my people has become cruel,␤ like the ostriches in the wilderness.
004:004 ¶  The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst.␤ The young children ask for bread,␤ and no one breaks it for them.
004:005 ¶  Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets.␤ Those who were brought up in purple embrace dunghills.
004:006 ¶  For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,␤ which was overthrown as in a moment.␤ No hands were laid on her.
004:007 ¶  Her nobles were purer than snow.␤ They were whiter than milk.␤ They were more ruddy in body than rubies.␤ Their polishing was like sapphire.
004:008 ¶  Their appearance is blacker than a coal.␤ They are not known in the streets.␤ Their skin clings to their bones.␤ It is withered.␤ It has become like wood.
004:009 ¶  Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger;␤ for these pine away, stricken through,␤ for lack of the fruits of the field.
004:010 ¶  The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children.␤ They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
004:011 ¶  Yahweh has accomplished his wrath.␤ He has poured out his fierce anger.␤ He has kindled a fire in Zion,␤ which has devoured its foundations.
004:012 ¶  The kings of the earth didn’t believe,␤ neither did all the inhabitants of the world,␤ that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.
004:013 ¶  It is because of the sins of her prophets ␤ and the iniquities of her priests,␤ that have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her.
004:014 ¶  They wander as blind men in the streets.␤ They are polluted with blood,␤ So that men can’t touch their garments.
004:015 ¶  “Go away!” they cried to them.␤ “Unclean! Go away! Go away! Don’t touch!␤ When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations,␤ “They can’t live here any more.”
004:016 ¶  Yahweh’s anger has scattered them.␤ He will not pay attention to them any more.␤ They didn’t respect the persons of the priests.␤ They didn’t favor the elders.
004:017 ¶  Our eyes still fail,␤ looking in vain for our help.␤ In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.
004:018 ¶  They hunt our steps,␤ so that we can’t go in our streets.␤ Our end is near.␤ Our days are fulfilled,␤ for our end has come.
004:019 ¶  Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky.␤ They chased us on the mountains.␤ They set an ambush for us in the wilderness.
004:020 ¶  The breath of our nostrils,␤ the anointed of Yahweh,␤ was taken in their pits;␤ of whom we said,␤ under his shadow we will live among the nations.
004:021 ¶  Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom,␤ who dwells in the land of Uz.␤ The cup will pass through to you also.␤ You will be drunken,␤ and will make yourself naked.
004:022 ¶  The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion.␤ He will no more carry you away into captivity.␤ He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom.␤ He will uncover your sins.
005:001 ¶  Remember, Yahweh, what has come on us.␤ Look, and see our reproach.␤
005:002 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,␤ our houses to aliens.␤
005:003 We are orphans and fatherless.␤ Our mothers are as widows.␤
005:004 We must pay for water to drink.␤ Our wood is sold to us.␤
005:005 Our pursuers are on our necks.␤ We are weary, and have no rest.␤
005:006 We have given our hands to the Egyptians,␤ and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.␤
005:007 Our fathers sinned, and are no more.␤ We have borne their iniquities.␤
005:008 Servants rule over us.␤ There is no one to deliver us out of their hand.␤
005:009 We get our bread at the peril of our lives,␤ because of the sword in the wilderness.␤
005:010 Our skin is black like an oven,␤ because of the burning heat of famine.␤
005:011 They ravished the women in Zion,␤ the virgins in the cities of Judah.␤
005:012 Princes were hanged up by their hands.␤ The faces of elders were not honored.␤
005:013 The young men carry millstones.␤ The children stumbled under loads of wood.␤
005:014 The elders have ceased from the gate,␤ and the young men from their music.␤
005:015 The joy of our heart has ceased.␤ Our dance is turned into mourning.␤
005:016 The crown has fallen from our head.␤ Woe to us, for we have sinned!␤
005:017 For this our heart is faint.␤ For these things our eyes are dim:␤
005:018 for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate.␤ The foxes walk on it.
005:019 ¶  You, Yahweh, remain forever.␤ Your throne is from generation to generation.␤
005:020 Why do you forget us forever,␤ and forsake us for so long a time?␤
005:021 Turn us to yourself, Yahweh, and we will be turned.␤ Renew our days as of old.␤
005:022 But you have utterly rejected us.␤ You are very angry against us.
