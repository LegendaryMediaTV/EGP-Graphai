001:001 ¶  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,° {NU reads Christ Jesus and omits the Lord.}
001:002 to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
001:003 ¶  As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,
001:004 and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith.
001:005 But the goal of this command is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith,
001:006 from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned away to vain talking,
001:007 desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say nor about what they strongly affirm.
001:008 ¶  But we know that the law is good if a person uses it lawfully,
001:009 as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
001:010 for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine,
001:011 according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
001:012 ¶  I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service,
001:013 although I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
001:014 The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
001:015 The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.
001:016 However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.
001:017 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
001:018 ¶  I commit this instruction to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which were given to you before, that by them you may wage the good warfare,
001:019 holding faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith,
001:020 of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
002:001 ¶  I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for all men,
002:002 for kings and all who are in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.
002:003 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
002:004 who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.
002:005 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
002:006 who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time,
002:007 to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
002:008 ¶  I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.
002:009 In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing,° {The word for “not” is the negative particle “ μη ” which denies an expected idea, as opposed to the usual word for “not” ( ου ) which denies a fact. Thus “ μη ” in this context is denying an expected idea (that women can be properly dressed without good works).}
002:010 but with good works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness.
002:011 Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission.
002:012 But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.
002:013 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
002:014 Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;
002:015 but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.
003:001 ¶  This is a faithful saying: someone who seeks to be an overseer desires a good work.° {or, superintendent, or bishop}
003:002 The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;
003:003 not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;
003:004 one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;
003:005 (for how could someone who doesn’t know how to rule his own house take care of God’s assembly?)
003:006 not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
003:007 Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.
003:008 ¶  Servants,in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money,° {or, Deacons.}
003:009 holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
003:010 Let them also first be tested; then let them serve if they are blameless.° {or, serve as deacons}
003:011 Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, and faithful in all things.
003:012 Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.° {or, deacons}
003:013 For those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.° {or, served well as deacons}
003:014 ¶  These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly,
003:015 but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God’s house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
003:016 Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great:␤ God was revealed in the flesh,␤ justified in the spirit,␤ seen by angels,␤ preached among the nations,␤ believed on in the world,␤ and received up in glory.° {NU replaces “God” with “who”}
004:001 ¶  But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,
004:002 through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron,
004:003 forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
004:004 For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.
004:005 For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
004:006 ¶  If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed.
004:007 But refuse profane and old wives’ fables. Exercise yourself toward godliness.
004:008 For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now and of that which is to come.
004:009 This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.
004:010 For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.
004:011 Command and teach these things.
004:012 ¶  Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.
004:013 Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.
004:014 Don’t neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elders.
004:015 Be diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all.
004:016 Pay attention to yourself and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
005:001 ¶  Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;
005:002 the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.
005:003 ¶  Honor widows who are widows indeed.
005:004 But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety toward their own family and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.° {TR adds “good and”}
005:005 Now she who is a widow indeed and desolate, has her hope set on God and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.
005:006 But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.
005:007 Also command these things, that they may be without reproach.
005:008 But if anyone doesn’t provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
005:009 ¶  Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,
005:010 being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work.
005:011 ¶  But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,
005:012 having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.
005:013 Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.
005:014 I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for insulting.
005:015 For already some have turned away after Satan.
005:016 If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don’t let the assembly be burdened, that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.
005:017 ¶  Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.
005:018 For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.” And,“The laborer is worthy of his wages.”° {Deuteronomy 25:4} ° {Luke 10:7; Leviticus 19:13}
005:019 ¶  Don’t receive an accusation against an elder except at the word of two or three witnesses.
005:020 Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.
005:021 I command you in the sight of God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
005:022 Lay hands hastily on no one. Don’t be a participant in other people’s sins. Keep yourself pure.
005:023 ¶  Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities.
005:024 ¶  Some men’s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.
005:025 In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can’t be hidden.
006:001 ¶  Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed.
006:002 Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.
006:003 ¶  If anyone teaches a different doctrine and doesn’t consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,
006:004 he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, insulting, evil suspicions,
006:005 constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.° {NU omits “Withdraw yourself from such.”}
006:006 ¶  But godliness with contentment is great gain.
006:007 For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can’t carry anything out.
006:008 But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.
006:009 But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.
006:010 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
006:011 ¶  But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.
006:012 Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.
006:013 I command you before God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,
006:014 that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
006:015 which at the right time he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords.
006:016 He alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see, to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.
006:017 ¶  Charge those who are rich in this present age that they not be arrogant, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;
006:018 that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to share;
006:019 laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life.
006:020 ¶  Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge,
006:021 which some profess, and thus have wandered from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
